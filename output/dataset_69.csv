   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: I have before me an application for bail by Peter Petrovski. Mr Petrovski was sentenced by a Magistrate to a period of imprisonment for an offence of mid range PCA, his reading being 0.145. He received a fixed term of imprisonment of six months. The Magistrate refused him bail pending an appeal to this Court. He now applies for Bail in this Court.2 Before dealing with the merits of the application, it is appropriate to turn to s 22A of the Bail Act. The Crown’s position is that s 22A(1) applies in the present circumstances. Mr Petrovski was legally represented when he applied for bail in the Local Court, so the Crown says that I should only entertain the application for bail brought today if I am satisfied that new facts or circumstances have arisen.3 Mr Heathcote (who appears for Mr Petrovski) submits s 22A does not apply to bail applications being made in a different jurisdiction to that where the application was originally made. 4 I now quote the opening words of s 22A(1) so that the argument advanced by the Crown can be understood. It reads, 
     
      
      “A court is to refuse to entertain an application for bail by a person accused of an offence if an application by the person in relation to that bail has already been made and dealt with by a court unless...” 
      
    5 The Crown says that the use of the words “a court” where secondly appearing suggests that if bail has been refused by any court, then any other court is to refuse to entertain an application for bail unless the circumstances in 22A(1)(a) or (b) are satisfied. That is the only argument that the Crown is able to advance in support of its position.6 I do not mean to denigrate the Crown’s position by saying that that is the only argument it can advance. It is a pretty good argument after all because it involves the interpretation of s 22A, giving meaning to the words in that section. If Mr Heathcote is correct then the section would have been better expressed if the words “a court” where secondly appearing, were replaced by the words “the court”. That would make it clear that what was to be inhibited was not a consideration of bail by a superior court following refusal of bail by a court lower in the hierarchy, but magistrate shopping or judge shopping. Mr Heathcote’s submission is that that is what s 22A is there to deal with, - cases where every time a person appears before a particular court, for whatever reason, mention or otherwise, a fresh bail application is made. 7 In the time that Mr Heathcote and the Crown have had available to them, no decision on this matter has been identified. Some earlier cases dealing with s 22A in its earlier form were found but they dealt with 22A when it was in a different form to that which it is presently in. Those cases, R v Kissner BC9202103 NSWSC Hunt CJ 17/1/1992 and R v Turkmani & R v Kaddour [2000] NSWSC 491 dealt with the position where there were repeated applications to the Supreme Court, not this present case where there is an appeal to the District Court following refusal of bail in the Local Court. 8 Section 22A was introduced in its present form fairly recently. The Bail Amendment Bill of 2007 was debated in the Legislative Council on 24 October 2007, after having been the subject of a second reading speech by the Attorney General a few days earlier. I will quote the relevant part of the Attorney General’s second reading speech: 
     
      
      “Provisions already exist to limit the number of applications for bail in the Supreme Court. These provisions will extend to bail applications in the local court.”  
      
    9 I interpolate here that that means that one can consider s 22A in its earlier form which, as I have mentioned, concerned repeated applications for bail in the one jurisdiction. The Attorney General in the speech, as I have just been quoting, suggests that these provisions will also apply to the local court jurisdiction. There is nothing in those sentences to suggest that the provisions will apply, to use an inelegant term, cross-jurisdictionally. The Attorney General went on: 
     
      
      “Under the amended provisions the court will not be able to proceed with a second bail hearing unless the applicant had no legal representation the first time he made an application for bail or the court can be satisfied that new facts or circumstances have arisen since the previous application. The changes strike an appropriate balance between offering greater protection to victims of crime to serving the rights of an accused to apply to a court for bail. Proviso recognises that an accused will often lack the necessary skills to present the case well and shall not be prejudiced through an initial inability to obtain representation. But changes will also prevent what is known as magistrate shopping, the process of going from magistrate to magistrate or judge to judge, with the hope of obtaining a different outcome.”  
      
    10 It is important to note that the Attorney General does not say the amendments will prevent an applicant going from magistrate to judge with the hope of obtaining a different outcome. After debate, the Attorney General’s reply was also of assistance. He said:  
     
      
      “I do not think it is unreasonable to say that the bill should contain some provisions to prevent forum shopping, in other words, every time a matter comes up before a court, a fresh decision can be made on the same facts. Ms Sylvia Hale may not receive the kinds of letters that I receive from victims who are concerned about a person who might have been refused bail on one occasion and who can then make another application every time a matter comes back before the court. There can be several occasions in the local court in particular, bearing in mind the process that involves briefs being prepared, committals and the various stages of the criminal justice process. I do not think it is unreasonable to state that a decision should be made if that decision is erroneous, to provide an appeal mechanism as still exists under these laws.”  
      
    11 Of course I am not to look at extrinsic material such as second reading speeches and speeches in reply to create confusion but only to resolve it. I am satisfied that, given the legislative history of s 22A, there is some confusion as to what the Parliament meant by the terms of s 22A. I do not consider that the use of the words “a court” where secondly appearing in s 22A, provides a clear and unmistakable basis for suggesting that the Crown’s view should prevail. I have therefore looked at the extrinsic materials provided by Mr Heathcote which make it clear beyond argument that the provision is limited in the way Mr Heathcote suggests. That is, it applies where a person has been refused bail in one jurisdiction and then makes a further application in that same jurisdiction. It does not apply in the present circumstance where having been refused bail by a magistrate, an appellant appears before the District Court seeking bail pending his appeal.12 I turn now to the merits of the matter. The appellant has substantial community ties. He lives with his mother who is in poor health. She is 76 years of age. The applicant’s criminal history does not suggest any failure to appear in the past. Apart from one offence of contravening an apprehended violence order, his previous criminal convictions all concern driving matters. There would be a risk of the appellant committing further offences but that risk can be reduced by an appropriate condition of bail which Mr Heathcote has suggested. Further, there is the possibility of a person depositing the sum of $10,000 as surety and for more abundant caution I can make it a condition of bail that the applicant report. In those circumstances, I am satisfied that the grant of bail is appropriate. So the applicant is granted bail. He is to report three times a week to the officer-in-charge of police at Mascot police station, that is every Monday, Wednesday and Friday between the hours of 8am and 8pm. He is to live at (...). He is to not drive any form of motor vehicle and accordingly, he is not to apply for the return of his licence. One acceptable person is to deposit the sum of $10,000 either in cash or security to that extent and enter into an agreement to forfeit such amount if the appellant fails to comply with his bail undertaking.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 MASON P: The appellant was tried in the District Court before Judge Freeman and a jury on an indictment charging as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
         involved an aggravated indecent assault when the appellant fondled the breasts and genitals of the 15 year old complainant. 
         
         
        Count 2 
         involved a sexual assault when the appellant engaged in cunnilingus. 
         
         
        Count 3 
         involved an aggravated indecent assault when the appellant kissed and forced his tongue deeply into the complainant’s throat.  
        
       
      
    2 The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on counts 1 and 3 and guilty on count 2. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.3 The Crown case was that the complainant, a school girl aged 15 years and 9 months, arranged to attend a birthday party for the appellant’s ten year old daughter. The venue was a remote country property normally occupied by the appellant and his daughter. The appellant was aged 55. 
     
      
    4 Several children and at least two other adult males spent the night before the party at the property. It was a “sleep-over” for the children. The complainant said that the appellant gave her 3 or 4 lemon and Vodka Ruskie drinks, and that this was the first time she had had alcohol. 
     
      
    5 The complainant elected to sleep in a bedroom separate from the younger children and she retired there about 11pm or a bit later. She changed into a T-shirt, underpants and pyjama pants. 
     
      
    6 A short time later the appellant came into the room. He asked if the complainant needed anything. She requested a clock and he returned with one. During a conversation that ensued he told her that he used to be a masseur and offered a massage to help her relax. She agreed and he set up a massage table in the bedroom and lit a candle.  
     
      
    7 The complainant gave evidence that the appellant told her that he could not massage her properly with the T-shirt and pyjamas she was wearing. She removed them and lay face down on the table. The appellant started massaging her, using Sorbolene cream. He massaged her shoulders, back, legs and arms and asked her to turn over. She did so and put a towel over her chest. 
     
      
    8 The appellant then started to massage her stomach and legs, then (after she began to get pain in the groin) her groin. After about 5 minutes the appellant’s hand went under her briefs. She told him that that was a little too far and not what she usually got when she had massages in a clinic associated with her mother. The appellant said “I’m sorry”, removed his hand and started massaging her stomach again.  
     
      
    9 The appellant then used his elbow to push her knees out and used his hands to massage her groin. His hands went under her briefs. According to the complainant, at one stage he moved one hand underneath the towel and massaged her breasts while rubbing up and down her “clit”. The complainant said that the appellant was doing that for about 10 minutes. She said that she kept saying, “No, this is really wrong, against the law” and that the appellant said, “Oh no, it’s okay, it’s normal, it’s just to relax you, make you feel good” (T p34). (The alleged rubbing of the breasts and genital area related to count 1 on which the appellant was acquitted.)  
     
      
    10 The complainant gave evidence that the appellant then walked from the side of the table to the end of the table where her legs were. He slid her briefs down. Then, after first using his hands he began to lick her. (This was the allegation of cunnilingus that was the basis of count 2.) He slid her briefs down and licked, sucked and kissed the area outside her vagina. The complainant said that at one stage the tongue “went in a little bit” to her vagina and that the licking and sucking continued for about an hour. 
     
      
    11 The complainant said that she was lying in shock. She was able to say a few words but the appellant didn’t listen to what she was saying. At one stage he told her that he was enjoying it and that he just wanted her to feel good. The complainant was asked if she did anything to stop the appellant and she said, “No I couldn’t do anything, just was laying there in shock. When I get really nervous I can’t move, I go into like a state”. She said that she kept repeating, “You know it’s wrong” (T p35). She said that the appellant did not say anything when she said those words. “The only way I figured for him to stop because I can’t move was to fake an orgy”. She said that by that expression she meant “orgasm” and that she did that by moaning for about 20 seconds. She said that the appellant stopped and stood up and said that he really enjoyed that. 
     
      
    12 The complainant gave evidence that she remembered saying that she wanted to go to bed and that it was wrong. She said that the appellant hugged her and then kissed her (T p36). The “pash” kissing involved him putting his tongue into her mouth and it lasted for about 15 seconds (T p37). (The allegation relating to the tongue kissing related to count 3 on which the appellant was acquitted.) 
     
      
    13 The complainant said that after he kissed her the appellant left the room for a couple of minutes. During that time she got off the massage table, put her shirt and pyjama pants back on and got into bed. When the appellant returned to the room, she told him he could “definitely go to gaol for this”. The appellant said, “I’m sorry, it was really good for me”. She said that the appellant was really happy but that he was sorry he did that and that he didn’t want to go to gaol. The complainant was asked if the appellant was in bed with her at any stage and she said: “Not that I can remember, no. He sat on the bed next to me, but then as we started talking about his going to gaol he left” (T p37). She said that after the appellant left the room she “basically passed out”. When asked if the alcoholic drinks that she had consumed had had any effect she said, “They made me dopey and tired, like I couldn’t move at all, and I was just getting really out of it and sleeping and zonked out” (T p39). 
     
      
    14 The complainant gave evidence that at one stage when she was lying on her stomach being massaged, the appellant’s daughter came into the room briefly and said, “I see you are getting one of dad’s massages” and that she replied, “Yes”. 
     
      
    15 It was put to the complainant in cross-examination that she had made up her allegations and that nothing of a sexual nature had happened in the bedroom. She denied it. 
     
      
    16 The appellant’s daughter gave evidence in the prosecution case that there were about six girls sleeping over at the property. All slept in the living room except the complainant who was in a spare room opposite the bathroom. The daughter got up shortly before 1 am. She saw the candle light in the bedroom, and she spoke to her father for between 10 and 20 minutes. She said that he was massaging the complainant’s shoulders. Later she went to the bathroom and, upon returning, watched her father for about 5 to 10 minutes as he massaged her legs. 
     
      
    17 The complainant said that she did not speak to any of the adults who were at the party the following day because she did not know who to trust. She was expecting to be picked up by her mother at about 2pm. When everybody left the party, at about 4 o’clock, she asked the appellant if she could call her mother to see if she could be picked up. The appellant told her that he had already spoken to her mother and that she couldn’t come to pick her up. Accordingly, she had to stay at the property for another night. On the second night she put a chair up against the door handle so that the appellant couldn’t come in (T p40). The appellant drove her back to her mother’s fiancé’s property the next day, ie the Sunday. 
     
      
    18 When the complainant got back to her mother’s fiancé’s property she telephoned her boyfriend telling him she had been sexually assaulted by the father of one of the girls at the party. The boyfriend corroborated this evidence, stating that she sounded upset. According to him, she told him “that he claimed that he was a qualified masseuse [sic] and asked for her to take off her top and he then proceeded to give her a massage and then told her to turn over and started massaging her upper body, and she told him to stop and he didn’t. He then went on to take off her pants, and I think, I can’t recall the exact words, but she said that he then tried to give her oral sex but she said stop, it’s wrong. I will tell the police”, and he then left her alone. 
     
      
    19 When the complainant’s mother returned home later that afternoon, the complainant showed her diary to her, stating “I can’t trust you again … read this”. The lengthy diary entry was originally dated 30 June 2005 but it had been corrected to 1 July 2005. The complainant gave evidence that she wrote the diary entry on Saturday 2 July 2005. The relevant part reads: 
     
      
       
        
        Then he switched convos to how he did a corse in massages n stuff for a few years. He asked if I wanted one very nicely. I couldn’t say no, you know how I am. He told me to get changed. I had my PJ’s on so I just took off my PJ’s, long pants and just wore my PJ short shorts which were underneath and my PJ’s, top I left on. I got up on to the table he had put in my room, layed down, he came in and said you’ll need to take your top of so I can do your back, so he slipped it off while I used the town under me to cover myself up. He got some kind of cream, oil, stuff and massaged my back, legs, arms, neck and shoulders. Then told me to turn over and lye on my back. So I held the towel over my chest, as I turned over and he massaged the front of my legs, tummy, face. He said I will leave the cream here so you can do your boobs and anywhere else you wanted massaged, so I started to have bad thoughts about him. He seemed nice though. He kept going on about massages are just a friendly thing to do for people and that’s it. Bullshit. With him no fucking way. What he was doing was to far, you are not supposed to massage the front as well I don’t think without saying anything. He put his hand underneath the cover towel and covered my tits and he started massaging them. I freaked and couldn’t move. I went like into shock. He finally stopped and went on with my stomach. He said that I’m lucky to have such a beautiful body. I just wanted to get a gun and shoot this fucking sicko in the head and rip all his insides out and feed him to the dogs but I just layed there and said this is relaxing me so much that I’ll just have to go to bed very soon. He ignored me and noticed that my legs were shaking. It was so cold and I was so scared, he grabbed them and said sorry, here, I’ll give you some support so he held my legs up while he kept massaging my stomach. It was so uncomfortable and he was too rough. The joint of my leg up and the top to my hips really started to hurt. I told him and he just then started to massage that which was a bad idea. I should have never of told him cos then he slipped his hands under my short shorts and kept rubbing the joint that was really sore. Then he did my hips. I couldn’t say or do anything I was so cold, scared and in pain that killed like shit. Then he put one hand under the towel at the top of me, massaged them again at the same time started to put his hands down slowly on my short shorts. I said not to go any further. He pulled out but kept doing the top half of me. I now officially hate this guy. A minute later he went back under my short shorts and put his hand right down under. He kept stroking with his fingers and kept up the top half. He said he’d love to kiss me down there. I’m like No, it’s okay, I’m getting really tired I should go to bed now. He said he’s not leaving until you get complete satisfaction. I was beginning to think he was gonna rape me or something. He practically already is even though I said no. I wanted to go to sleep. He just pushed my legs apart and full on started giving me oral sex. I hated it. My leg felt like it was gonna break, the joint was so sore but it didn’t. I felt like my body was filled with continual internal bruising. I said I really should go to bed, I tried to close my legs but he kept pushing against them. I felt helpless like I was so weak I could barely move. He kept going. The only way I could make him stop cos I couldn’t move was by faking an orgasim so he thought that his work was done so he could leave but he didn’t stop until another hour. He finally pulled himself up and lent over me, grabbed me like he was hugging me or something and forced his tongue down my throat. I was putrid. He lifted me up on the bed, he quickly packed the table up while I grabbed some clothes, chucked them on, then before I could bolt he put me back on the bed and took his own clothes off, got on top of me and started kissen me again. He said do you want me to grab a condom? I said No! it’s really okay, I am so tired I can hardly move. You should just go to your own bed!! As soon as I said that I could put him in gaol and he would never see his family again he said I’m so sorry, jumped off me, put his clothes back on and left to his own bedroom. I was so relieved he had finally gone. I found it so disgustingly dirty, rotten, weak, hopeless, sore and so tired, I just wrote all this and I am going to sleep now. He hasn’t come back.

    20 After the complainant’s mother read the diary she contacted the police. The complainant was interviewed on 4 July and her underpants were given to a police scientific officer. 
     
      
    21 The complainant’s mother gave evidence that she tried on a number of occasions to phone her daughter when she was at the appellant’s property. She spoke to the appellant on each occasion and asked him to have her daughter ring back. This did not occur. At one stage the appellant told her that there had been a change of plans and the complainant would like to stay an extra night. 
     
      
    22 The appellant gave evidence. He said that he assumed the complainant to be somewhere between 16 and 20. 
     
      
    23 He said that he went to the complainant’s bedroom to check if there were enough bed clothes. He got a clock for the complainant. She told him that she had trouble sleeping and that sometimes her mother gave her a massage. He said that he was qualified in massage and she accepted his offer to give her one. He went and got his massage table, some towels, Sorbelene and a candle because there was no light in the room. 
     
      
    24 The complainant took her pyjama pants and T-shirt off and he massaged her back for between 45 and 50 minutes. He told her that if she wanted to roll over he would massage the front of her legs and back of her head. She complained about a really sore joint on the top of her leg and so he commenced massaging the groin. 
     
      
    25 The appellant said that he did not do anything with the complainant’s underpants and that her claim that he had taken them off was incorrect. The massage took about one and a half hours or a little longer and it finished after he had massaged the top of the leg. 
     
      
    26 The appellant said that after he had packed up the massage table the complainant, who had put her pyjamas back on, said that he could lie on the bed and talk to her if he wanted. His trousers were muddy and he removed them after the complainant indicated that that was fine. The appellant said that he lay on the bed speaking to the complainant. He did not touch her sexually at all. He dropped off to sleep, but woke up when the complainant suddenly jumped on top of him. She squashed his testicles and he said “Jesus Christ, what are you doing?” She said: “Oh, please don’t tell my mother”. (The complainant’s evidence on this topic was that she couldn’t remember the appellant having taken off his trousers. She did, however, acknowledge she had told the police on 4 July 2005 that the appellant had taken his clothes off, except his jocks, and that he got under the blankets and started hugging her (T p92).) 
     
      
    27 The appellant said that he spoke to the complainant’s mother twice on the Saturday. She was unable to pick her daughter up and asked him to try to arrange a lift for the complainant. Arrangements were made with one of the men at the party but the complainant responded that she did not want to go. The complainant later declined a lift from another man who was at the property and she elected to stay until the next day when the appellant drove her back to her mother. 
     
      
    28 A significant part of the Crown case was evidence relating to the DNA found in the complainant’s underpants. It was in effect common ground that it was from two sources, the complainant and the appellant. It is far from clear how there was any DNA from the appellant inside the pants on his version of the massage but I do not dwell on this point. The main dispute at trial on this matter was whether the appellant’s DNA came from a rich source, such as saliva, or from a poor source, such as skin. Experts called on both sides debated the possible impact of Sorbolene upon the appellant’s capacity to shed DNA from his hands in the quantity that was found in the underpants. This will be considered in detail when I address the ground of appeal relating to the evidence of the prosecution expert, Dr Neville. 
     
      
    29 It is convenient to address the three grounds of appeal relating to the conviction in reverse order. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The verdict was unreasonable 
       
      
    30 The appellant submits that no jury, properly instructed could, relying on the reliability of the complainant’s evidence, have been satisfied to the requisite standard. 
     
      
    31 The complainant was said to have been an unreliable witness in a number of respects that were developed in detail in written and oral submissions. 
     
      
    32 Having considered the totality of the evidence I am of the view that it was well open to the jury to accept the Crown case. The jury were given proper directions and they had ample opportunity to consider the testimony of the complainant that was adhered to in its substance under cross-examination. The complainant made prompt and consistent complaint to her boyfriend, her mother and the police. The DNA evidence provided significant corroboration of the cunnilingus count. The appellant’s conduct was, by his own admission, highly imprudent and it involved clearly inappropriate conduct towards a vulnerable young person. 
     
      
    33 Most of the points raised by the appellant concern matters of detail that do not strike me as going to essential matters of credit and reliability, and certainly not as destructive of the complainant’s central testimony. I have considered all matters that have been raised. What follows are my responses to the main points. 
     
      
    34 The appellant first submits that unreliability was demonstrated by the complainant’s behaviour after the alleged assaults. She went off to sleep, participated in the birthday party the next day and made no complaint to anyone, adult or child, at the appellant’s property. She is said to have made no effort to get a lift back to her mother. 
     
      
    35 These submissions are far from compelling. The complainant had been affected to a degree by the liquor which the appellant had supplied her. On her account, she had undergone a series of events that had started with an offer of general assistance, progressed to a massage that was innocent in its early physical aspects and then moved to an assault that was overlaid with professions of affection. It is unsurprising that she felt waves of confusion, distrust and anger the morning after. She was several years older than the other girls at the party and so it is unsurprising that she would not have unburdened herself to them. She made prompt complaint as soon as she was able to communicate with her boyfriend and her mother. She had never met any of the men who lived at the appellant’s property or who stayed over for the party. The men whom the appellant suggested might give her a lift home were friends of the appellant and strangers to her before she came to the property. She obviously wanted her mother to pick her up and she was initially prepared to wait until she did. Whether or not the appellant contributed in any way to the delay in this happening is neither here nor there.  
     
      
    36 One of the houseguests was a policeman, but he was a friend of the appellant and the complainant swore that she did not know he was a police officer. 
     
      
    37 The appellant secondly points to aspects of the diary entry that are said to be inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence. Included in this submission were arguments based on inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence concerning whether the diary was written on the Saturday or the Sunday. Once again these strike me as immaterial points of detail. Nor do I see any weight in the arguments based upon alterations in the diary and the fact that certain portions of the diary entry were not replicated in the complainant’s testimony. The complainant was in the habit of keeping a diary and her entry about this topic was not apparently written for the purpose of forming a police statement. Exaggerations in the course of a painful, and at times angry, stream of consciousness do not strike me as wholly destructive of the complainant’s credibility. 
     
      
    38 Considerable attention was placed on the diary entry stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “I swore my head off at him, kicked him, pushed him away.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    39 In cross-examination the complaint agreed that, despite the entry, at no stage did she kick the appellant or push him away. She had attempted to do these things and wished she had done so. The diary was therefore (in her words) an “over-exaggeration” like many things written in the diary (T p90). She also testified that she had in fact sworn at him, “just not a lot” (T p90). 
     
      
    40 The complainant adhered at trial to her evidence that she had resisted the appellant and made it clear to him that she was resisting at the stage where the massage became overtly sexual in nature. If the tone and level of the resistance were exaggerated slightly in the diary written on the morning after this, in my view, was understandable given that the complainant must have felt both confused and angry as she reflected upon what had actually happened. The jury were best placed to assess whether the diary discrepancies (if discrepancies they were) were destructive of trial testimony that was detailed, generally consistent, and consonant with the primary aspects of the complaints made promptly to the boyfriend and the mother. 
     
      
    41 The third matter deserving a particular response is the appellant’s submission that the place and time of the commission of the offences made them inherently unlikely. As to time, the complainant’s testimony was that the licking and sucking went on for about an hour. If this was an accurate time-frame then it may well have occurred at a time when other persons sleeping in the house on the Friday night went past the door of the bedroom on their way to the toilet. As indicated, the appellant’s daughter witnessed part of the massage and spoke to her father while it was taking place.  
     
      
    42 In my view, these matters did not require the jury to reject the prosecution case. After all, the very fact that the massage took place in the candlelit room is common ground. On the appellant’s own version it lasted for about one hour and 40 minutes (T p332). There was ample opportunity for the unwanted intimacy spoken about by the complainant to have occurred unwitnessed by others. The appellant’s daughter said that the door to the room was shut (T p184). 
     
      
    43 The complainant’s evidence about whether she actually spoke to her mother by phone on the Saturday, asking to be picked up, was inconsistent to a degree. The mother’s evidence was that there was no direct contact that day. The complainant’s diary contained a statement that “after the party I rang Mum to say could she please pick me up in 20 minutes. Five minutes later she rang back and said she was too busy.” At the end of the day the complainant agreed with the cross-examiner that she did not speak to her mother on the Saturday. These difficulties with this aspect of the complainant’s account did not require the jury to reject her main testimony.  
     
      
      Ground 2: The verdicts were inconsistent 
       
      
    44 The appellant submits that the verdict of guilty on the second count could not stand with the verdicts of not guilty on the other two counts. All three offences were alleged to have been committed as part of the one exercise and each count depended on the acceptance of the complainant as a truthful and reliable witness beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    45 The summing up contained the standard directions that it was open to the jury to accept any witness in whole or in part. The jury were also instructed of the need to scrutinise the evidence of the complainant carefully because the Crown case depended on acceptance of her testimony. 
     
      
    46 The appellant points to the deficiencies in the complainant’s evidence referred to above. It is submitted that these led the jury not to accept the complainant’s evidence on the first and third count. But if she was to be accepted at all, there was no good reason to distinguish between what she said as to any one of the three offences. 
     
      
    47 I would reject this ground of appeal. In my view, the prosecution case was a fairly strong one with the complainant being effectively corroborated at several points. It was clear that the second count was the most serious offence and it had the additional support of the DNA evidence. The evidence that the complainant was resisting the appellant, and doing so to his knowledge, was also at its strongest with respect to the second count.48 In addition, the very fact that the sexual offending all happened within the one episode created a situation where the jury may have formed the view that a verdict of guilty on the main count was sufficient to reflect the appellant’s culpability (see R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82 at [75]-[77] per Spigelman CJ, [227]-[230] per Wood CJ at CL). 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Errors in relation to the DNA evidence 
       
      
    49 The appellant submitted that the trial miscarried as a result of the admission of evidence given by Ms Neville concerning the significance of the finding of DNA on the complainant’s underpants. 
     
      
    50 The prosecution led evidence from Ms Sharon Neville, a senior forensic biologist employed at the Division of Analytic Laboratories. Ms Neville conducted tests in relation to a sample of DNA taken from the inside crotch area of the underpants, comparing that sample with buccal samples from the complainant and the appellant. 
     
      
    51 Strictly speaking, the appellant could not be excluded as the male contributor to the DNA mixture. In fact, the trial proceeded on the basis that it was, in effect, common ground that his DNA was found, together with that of the complainant, in the underpants. 
     
      
    52 As indicated, the main dispute at trial was whether the appellant’s DNA came from a rich source, such as saliva, or from a poor source, such as skin. The defence case was that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant’s DNA was transferred to the complainant’s genital area from his tongue, as distinct from his hands that were performing a massage at least in the vicinity of that part of the complainant’s body. 
     
      
    53 The defence called expert evidence from Dr Brian McDonald who carries on business as DNA Consults. Dr McDonald has a PhD and a degree in pathology. He has extensive experience in DNA, including forensic issues associated with it.54 At the point in the trial when the prosecutor was about to call Ms Neville as a witness, counsel for the appellant indicated his objection to “certain material” in the report of the witness that had been provided (T p249). That material was said to have “on its face no scientific basis given”. 
     
      
    55 A voir dire examination ensued. No dispute was raised as to Ms Neville’s general qualifications or her experience as a team leader for a group of scientists in a sexual assault unit. Ms Neville had regularly attended international conferences and courses covering the analysis of DNA. She had been involved in DNA analysis for approximately 17 years and had given evidence in criminal proceedings on numerous occasions. 
     
      
    56 Ms Neville said that, given her experience in the laboratory, she would expect to get a good DNA result from saliva, if it was present (T p254). In the present case she had found that the DNA from the male contributor was double the amount of the female contributor. This gave her (T p256): 
     
      
       
        
        … a strong indication that that is likely to have come from a good source of DNA, such as perhaps saliva, which in this case was consistent with the allegation of oral intercourse. So it gave me a strong – the levels gave me a strong indication that saliva was a probable source for the DNA from the male individual. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    57 When asked by the prosecutor whether, from her experience, the most likely source was from saliva (T p258) “Yes, I believe so. Based on the very large amount of DNA that I have recovered from that area, it is inconsistent with the amount of DNA that I would regularly see associated with somebody perhaps handling an item. Such a large quantity of DNA was recovered, which can be attributed to the male contributor, it’s not consistent in my view, based on the large number of cases that I have seen, to have come from a source such as skin cells.”58 On my reading of the voir dire transcript, none of this evidence about the quantity of the DNA and the probability of it having come from a rich source such as saliva, was directly challenged. Ms Neville based her conclusions in this regard upon her general knowledge and experience as a biologist expert in DNA and its forensic aspects. 
     
      
    59 What was raised by way of challenge in the voir dire hearing was a particular hypothesis that the presence of Sorbolene cream on the defendant’s hands might have had the effect of facilitating the transfer of DNA from the skin on his hands. 
     
      
    60 Ms Neville had experience in the personal use of Sorbolene cream but she readily admitted that she had no knowledge or experience of it in a laboratory setting (T p258). Pressed both in chief (T pp258-9) and in cross-examination (T pp263-4), she said that she had neither carried out any tests in relation to Sorbolene nor did she know of any scientific literature on the topic. In cross-examination, she conceded that it was possible that Sorbolene was like sweat and that it might increase the amount of DNA transferred. But it was also possible that Sorbolene might reduce the transfer by providing a barrier between the skin surface (and the point of ultimate transfer) (T p264). Her opinion, nevertheless, was that (T p265): 
     
      
       
        
        … even if it did increase it, it would have to increase it to such an enormous extent for me to recover the bucket of DNA that I recovered from that underpants … It would have to have had an extraordinary effect on the transfer of DNA because the amount I have obtained from the inside of that underpants is so large, so I have taken it into account. I still believe it is consistent with a source of DNA that is rich such as saliva. 
        
       
       
      
    61 Ms Neville conceded that she should not “specifically discuss the effect of Sorbolene because I haven’t seen what the effects of that are” (T p270). She nevertheless responded to the questions of the cross-examiner suggesting that her testimony in the present case was ultimately pure guesswork. Ms Neville denied this. She adhered to her opinion, based on “cases day after day with the same sort of allegations of oral sex, touching, transfer of DNA” (T p270). Ms Neville accepted that she could not give a definitive answer as to whether the effect of the Sorbolene would be to decrease the DNA transfer or to increase it. She gave the following evidence (T p273): 
     
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. So we just assume that we decrease it? 
         
        A. No, we don’t assume that. We can’t give a definitive answer as to whether it increases or decreases it. What I have said or tried to convey is even if the Sorbolene was increasing the transfer of DNA, I still would be surprised to recover such a large amount of DNA from skin transfer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why? 
         
        A. Even with a facilitator such as Sorbolene or sweat. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But why, you’ve done no experiments? 
         
        A. That’s right, because I’m basing it, I’m comparing it to sweat and I have no conceivable reason to think that Sorbolene would increase the DNA transfer to a greater extent than sweat. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    62 Judge Freeman ruled that the jury were entitled to hear Ms Neville’s opinion. The nub of his Honour’s reasons was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        However, Miss Neville opined that the saliva was present on another basis, namely, that the quantity of DNA material recovered from the test area was such that it could only have come from, or was highly likely to have come from some rich source of DNA material, such as a body fluid. Blood, semen and nasal discharge are all excluded, leaving, as I understand it, saliva. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Jeffreys seeks to have this opinion excluded on the basis that there is no proven scientific material establishing the effects of Sorbolene cream on the shedding and transference of skin cells, and there is no definitive research into the effect of legitimate massage on the shedding or transfer, and there is no basis in her training or experience which would enable Miss Neville to speak of the possibility of a transfer from the groin of such accumulated skin cells to the inside of the crutch of the underpants by some unknown but conceivable contact or friction. The argument is that Miss Neville simply does not have the qualifications to express an opinion. I am unpersuaded by that. It seems to me that her experience and background do enable her to express an opinion about the likely source of the rich vein of DNA material which she unearthed. She seemed to me to have dealt with the arguments as well as she could in the absence of demonstrated scientific information, but based on her experience, using as an example the amplifying effects of perspiration and so on. I think the jury is entitled to hear her opinion and I propose to allow it. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    63 Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that this ruling was in error. The witness lacked “specialised knowledge” on the matter in question (see Evidence Act 1995, s79). The evidence given in the voir dire failed to substantiate that Ms Neville was an expert able to proffer an opinion “wholly or substantially based on [her expert] knowledge” as required by s79 of the Evidence Act as expounded in Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305, 52 NSWLR 705. 
     
      
    64 This being an appeal against conviction, it is necessary to examine the evidence that the expert actually gave to the jury. At the end of the day, it is that evidence whose admissibility is to be tested in this Court in the context of its impact upon the conviction under challenge. 
     
      
    65 Ms Neville told the jury about her experience as a forensic biologist and gave general evidence about different sources of DNA material. 
     
      
    66 Ms Neville told the jury that both the ratio of DNA as between the male and female contributors and the quantity of DNA recovered in the underpants were significant because (T pp289-290): 
     
      
       
        
        … there’s two important things here. One is the fact that the male contributor is double the amount of female, but also the actual amount of DNA itself is a very large quantity of DNA. It’s the sort of quantity of DNA that we recover from body fluids that are rich in DNA, such as blood stains and saliva stains. It’s not the sort of DNA result that we recover from skin cells. So from items that have been handled or even items that have been worn by somebody, I wouldn’t expect to find the level of DNA that I’ve seen here. I could do, but it’s not an expectation. I would expect if to be associated with a body fluid rich in DNA, such as saliva. 
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
        Q. In your laboratory work have you dealt with cases that involve the transfer of skin cells by touching? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, in many cases. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And based on your specialised knowledge and training and experience as a forensic biologist and as a senior forensic biologist, are you able to express a view as to the amount of DNA that you recovered, that is the double amount of DNA recovered, as to its likely source? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes. In my opinion in this case the DNA that we have recovered from the inside of the underpants is consistent with originating – the female component is consistent with possibly a mixture of skin cells and vaginal fluid and the male component, being double the amount of the female component, is consistent with originating with a source such as saliva. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now, in coming to that view, had you taken into account whether or not the contributor, the male contributor might be a shedder of cells, skin cells? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, I have. We have – people shed skin cells at different rates. We have what we call poor shedders of DNA and good shedders of DNA. So a good shedder is someone who tends to leave more DNA than a poor shedder. They may not necessarily always leave more DNA, but in general terms they have a tendency to leave more. Even with a good shedder of DNA, I still in my opinion, based on the number of cases that I have looked at involving items that have been worn and been touched, this amount that I have recovered here is very large and it would be unusual to be associated even with a very good shedder. A person would need to be an extremely prolific shedder of DNA to result in the enormous quantity of DNA that I have recovered here. 
        
       
      
    67 Ms Neville told the jury that it was difficult to give a very definitive answer to the question whether Sorbolene cream could have an impact on facilitating or decreasing the transfer of skin cells. She said that there was no published literature on the impact of Sorbolene cream. She accepted that it was possible that the cream, like sweat, might increase the transfer of DNA from skin to an item or to other skin. Alternatively, it was possible that Sorbolene could actually reduce the amount of transfer by forming a barrier between the skin surfaces (T pp291, 292). 
     
      
    68 Ms Neville expressed the belief that the result she obtained in the present case (T p294): 
     
      
       
        
        … is inconsistent with originating from skin cells. I’m not ruling that out as a possibility. It is a possibility, but the very great amounts of DNA that I have recovered, and taking into consideration that the male component is double the amount of the female who’s the wearer of the underpants, and the vaginal secretions are present, my overall interpretation of that result is that it’s consistent with originating from saliva, a body fluid that is rich in DNA. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    69 Ms Neville resisted the cross-examiner’s invitation to put a percentage on the degree of this consistency beyond stating that she would put the probability ratio higher than 51 to 49 (T p297). She repeated her testimony that what she discovered was in her opinion inconsistent with the result she would get from skin particles “but I would not exclude the possibility it could come from skin particles” (T p297, see also T p298). 
     
      
    70 In re-examination she gave the following evidence (T p316): 
     
      
       
        
        Q. And what source would you expect that DNA to come from, to leave that quantity? 
        
       
       
        
        A. As I’ve said, I believe it’s consistent with originating from saliva, based on my experience of many similar sort of cases where oral intercourse has occurred and similar testing has been carried out on the inside of underpants, we do tend to recover far greater amounts of DNA when saliva is alleged to have been present. It is typical of the result that I would expect, if saliva was present. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    71 The defence expert, Dr McDonald said that Sorbolene “will have the effect of accumulating skin cells… and as a consequence of that, it is then going to, you know, have the opportunity to transfer to anything which it comes in contact with” (T p414). Dr McDonald said that friction between surfaces of skin will cause a greater loss of cells (T p414). 
     
      
    72 Dr McDonald had heard Ms Neville’s evidence about the amount and ratio of DNA found in the complainant’s underpants. 
     
      
    73 Dr McDonald said that the ratio of the male to the female DNA was “not inconsistent with [salivatory] transfer. It’s a large amount of DNA relatively speaking”. 
     
      
    74 However, in Dr McDonald’s view, the problem was that this was not the only explanation. He said that “the action of massage and this friction between two surfaces into a fluid which can accumulate cells has the potential to create a large number of cells” (T p415). 
     
      
    75 Dr McDonald did not suggest any greater knowledge of the capacity of Sorbolene to facilitate the transfer of skin cell DNA than indicated in the passages I have extracted. Not surprisingly he was challenged in cross-examination with the hypothesis that Sorbolene might be expected to reduce the friction between surfaces.76 Detailed directions were given to assist the jury in resolving the conflict between the two DNA experts. The summing up contained the following (SU 09/02/07 pp11-12): 
     
      
       
        
        Ms Neville says, while we are on the subject, very briefly, that such high concentration of the accused’s DNA must come from a high number of cells because each cell has DNA. Skin normally is not a high level conveyor of DNA, if you like, because you do not get a great concentration of skin cells. You get a greater concentration of cells, as Dr McDonald explained, in semen most of all and then blood and then saliva and so on.  
         
         
        So, she says that whatever the source of this DNA was, it was one of the right sources because there is so much of it, “a bucket load” of DNA and she says consequently that is, if you accept that it is saliva, that explains it and if you accept that it is saliva then clearly you would conclude that he had put his mouth where the girl says he put his mouth. 
         
         
        Dr McDonald says, “Look, that is entirely possible but you cannot exclude the other alternative.” You have got to have a reasonable doubt about that hypothesis because there are other ways in which such a high concentration of cells and consequently DNA could have appeared on the inside of this young girls’ pants and one of those is this medium sorbolene cream rich in skin cells because it had accumulated them and held them in suspension. 
        
       
      
    77 Immediately before and immediately after this direction the jury were reminded that the Crown bore the onus of proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the course of the latter warning his Honour told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        The purpose of calling Dr McDonald is to see whether his evidence raises a reasonable doubt about what Ms Neville says is a highly probable explanation, the one supportive of  
          
        [the complainant], namely that all of the DNA came from the saliva of the accused. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    78 The appellant submitted in this Court that the reference to “a highly probable explanation” overstated Ms Neville’s evidence. 
     
      
    79 I do not think that there is any substance in this last-mentioned complaint. In the first place the summary was substantially accurate. Secondly, the comment was a passing one made in a context where the substantive direction concerned the onus and standard of proof. Third, no redirection was sought. 
     
      
    80 The appellant further submitted that the Judge should have given the jury greater assistance about the Sorbolene issue. I disagree. Close examination of Dr McDonald’s evidence reveals it as extremely vague as to its own scientific basis for raising the Sorbolene hypothesis. 
     
      
    81 The appellant submitted that Ms Neville’s opinion evidence did not go beyond a bare ipse dixit in relation to the Sorbolene matter. She did not, it was contended, reveal the necessary scientific criteria to disclose a contestable basis for testing the accuracy of her conclusion that the DNA recovered from the complainant’s underpants was consistent with originating from saliva, indeed more likely to be from this source than from skin cells. 
     
      
    82 I do not agree.  
     
      
    83 The relevant statutory requirement in s79 of the Evidence Act is that the expert’s opinion “is wholly or substantially based on” training, study or experience. The question whether the witness has the requisite expertise is itself a question of fact, only reviewable by an appellate court on well established grounds (Clark v Ryan (1960) 103 CLR 486 at 503; Middleton v The Queen [2000] WASCA 213, (2000) 114 A Crim R 258 at [21]). 
     
      
    84 Authoritative case law also establishes that the expert’s reasoning process should be sufficiently exposed to enable an evaluation as to how the expert used his or her expertise in reaching the opinion stated (HG v The Queen [1999] HCA 2, 197 CLR 414 at [39]-[41] 427-8; Makita at 744[85]; Keller v R [2006] NSWCCA 204 at [29]). Beyond this, the weight of the opinion is a matter for the tribunal of fact. 
     
      
    85 These principles do not exclude the testimony of a witness who is prepared to acknowledge a gap in his or her knowledge yet demonstrate ability based upon expertise to respond to questions (especially from the cross-examiner) designed to bring general experience and expertise to bear upon a particular issue. Nor do these principles require the testimony of one expert to be rejected merely because another expert is not prepared to essay a view in a particular matter or is prepared to essay (however tentatively) a view tending in the opposite direction. 
     
      
    86 Ms Neville’s extensive specialist training and experience armed her with the capacity to opine that the quantity of the appellant’s DNA found in the underpants indicated that it came from a rich DNA source rather than a poor source. She explained the bases for her views while conceding the possibility of a contrary conclusion.  
     
      
    87 Ms Neville did not accept the validity of the defence theory involving the proposition that Sorbolene would have reduced friction while increasing the flow of DNA from a dry source. She was prepared to expose her reasoning on this matter when pressed by the cross-examiner both during the voir dire and in the trial itself. But she was not obliged to abandon her central opinion merely because the cross-examiner put the Sorbolene theory to her. Neither was the Judge required to reject her testimony on a similar basis.  
     
      
    88 The posited Sorbolene theory was not recognised in scientific literature nor otherwise established in the evidence as having any validity. In truth, the defence case on the point had all of the hallmarks of the famous question about the coefficient of the expansion of brass as recounted by the cross-examiner himself, the Right Honourable Sir Norman Birkett, in an article entitled “The Art of Advocacy: Character and Skills for the Trial of Cases” (1948) 34 American Bar Association Journal 4 at 81: 
     
      
       
        
        I was the counsel for the Crown and a man came in to the box for the defense who called himself an expert witness.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        And there was I rising to cross-examine him, and whether it was inspiration or what it was I don't know, but my first question in the cross-examination of the man certainly wasn't in the brief. I said: ""Tell me, sir, what is the coefficient of the expansion of brass?"" And he didn't know. I am not sure that I did, but he couldn't ask me questions and I could ask him, and he didn't know. And from that moment, of course, it was easy. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    89 This barrister’s war story leaves it far from clear as to whether the question had any relevance to the matter at issue, even relevance as to credit. This said, I refrain from passing any judgment upon the ethics of the style of advocacy being advocated by Birkett. See further Burnside J, “R v AA Rouse” (2003) 124 Victorian Bar News 55. 
     
      
    90 The point of present relevance is, however, that Birkett’s question carried no probative weight unless (had it been objected to) its relevance was shown. In truth, Birkett was only interested in destroying a puffed up witness’ credibility in the eyes of the jury. In the present case the appellant has not shown that the Sorbolene theory was itself valid or that such theory destroyed the capacity of Ms Neville to stick to her own guns in maintaining her opinion on the central issue. 
     
      
    91 Ms Neville’s answer went well beyond guesswork or a mere ipse dixit. In my view, her testimony that I have summarised or quoted above showed her to be well qualified by training and experience to express opinions as to the likely source of DNA as between rich and dry DNA sources. That opinion proceeded from the quantity of the appellant’s DNA recovered from the sample. Ms Neville said that the amount recovered was unusually large even taking into account the possibility of the male contributor being a good shedder of DNA (T p290). She referred to her observations of saliva samples “day in day out” (T p298). She said that 9 nanograms in 20 microlitres being recovered could be described as “a bucket of DNA” and a “huge amount of DNA” (T p317). 
     
      
    92 Contrary to the appellant’s submission, it was not incumbent upon the trial judge to warn the jury against accepting Ms Neville’s testimony.93 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    94 The appeal against conviction should therefore be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    95 The appellant seeks leave to challenge the sentence of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years on the bases that: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence was unduly harsh and severe; 
       
       
      2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to sufficiently take into account the offender’s age and good character; and  
       
       
      3. The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into or sufficiently take into account the offender’s relationship with his daughter. 
       
      
    96 The offence under s61J of the Crimes Act 1900 carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. It attracted a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    97 In sentencing, Judge Freeman found that the offence was not planned, rather it was opportunistic, essentially spontaneous. His Honour appears to have accepted the complainant’s evidence that the sexual act of cunnilingus went on for perhaps an hour. This type of intercourse was characterised as being at the lower end of criminality, not that it was anything other than a very serious crime (ROS p5). The age of the particular victim was also taken into account. 
     
      
    98 His Honour concluded that the offence established by the verdict fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It was however found that the offence was aggravated by virtue of the breach of trust which both the victim and her mother had imposed upon the appellant. His Honour correctly observed that crimes of this nature are regarded with great seriousness; and that principles of general deterrence and retribution require earnest consideration even where the offence was “an aberration, a singular departure from the offenders previous behaviour” (ROS p9). The judge concluded that the appellant was unlikely to re-offend. 
     
      
    99 As he worked through the checklist offered by s21A of the (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, his Honour observed that it was clear that the offender was entitled to have his previous good character taken into account. The appellant was then aged 56, he had no prior criminal convictions, and he had a positive store of community goodwill on which to draw because of the high regard in which he was held in the community and the contribution which he made to the community before this offence. 
     
      
    100 Pausing here, I cannot accept the appellant’s submissions that the sentence was unduly harsh and severe or that the judge erred in failing “to sufficiently take into account” the appellant’s age and character. 
     
      
    101 Senior counsel for the appellant relied upon his written submissions which, as usual, were careful and detailed. In my view, they re-agitated the matters that were placed before the sentencing judge and taken into account by him, without establishing any appealable error. The judge took account of all material matters that were put before him. His conclusion as to the ultimate sentence was well within the range indicated by the legislation and the authorities relied upon by the appellant. 
     
      
    102 The third ground contends that the Judge erred in the account he took of the appellant’s relationship with his daughter. 
     
      
    103 The appellant was the carer for his daughter now aged 12 and he had been her carer for almost all of her life. A Family Court Order of 2000 had granted custody to him and had limited the contact access of the child’s mother. The mother has been diagnosed as suffering from bipolar disorder with associated complications of excessive drinking and gambling. A medical opinion in 1999 referred to depressive states, panic disorder and suicide periods. In 2002 there had been an involuntary admission to hospital. There was further evidence of alcohol abuse, including a conviction for high-range PCA in 2003. 
     
      
    104 The mother gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings as to her current domestic arrangements and her current employment as a credit controller. She said that she continues to take her medication. The thrust of her evidence was that she was presently fit to assume a more substantial role in the care of her daughter. She was challenged on these matters in cross-examination. 
     
      
    105 His Honour observed that the mother presented in giving her evidence as stable, controlled and intelligent. There was nothing in her affect which would cause concern about her being the guardian of her 12 year old daughter. He continued (ROS p12): 
     
      
       
        
        That, however, and this is fortunate, is not the decision of this court to make. Despite having some misgivings because of her past difficulties I am not prepared to find that if as a result of the prisoner’s incarceration the child came into the care of her mother that that would be so unfortunate that in order to prevent such a possibility I should eschew otherwise appropriate orders and choose some alternative sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        In any event, the prisoner has not established that the child would necessarily go to the care of her mother. There are other options.  
        [His Honour referred to various possibilities involving the appellant’s siblings before concluding ROS p13]  
        I do not think I should find, even on the balance of probabilities, that the impact of imprisoning this offender is likely to be so extraordinary on his daughter that such imprisonment should be avoided. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    106 This information has not been updated and the Court is unaware of the present custodial circumstances of the appellant’s child. This observation is not, however, a criticism, because the appellant would have to first establish error on the part of the sentencing Judge before this Court would have any role in re-sentencing. 
     
      
    107 It was submitted that the Judge should have made some allowance for the hardship to the appellant’s daughter established on the evidence. 
     
      
    108 In my view no error has been shown. This was a case in which the imposition of a significant custodial sentence was inevitable. Such an event must necessarily have triggered the need for alternative custodial arrangements for the appellant’s daughter. The sentencing Judge found that there were special circumstances justifying some alteration to the statutory proportions of the sentence. He included in them the appellant’s “level of concern which he will undoubtedly feel for his daughter’s welfare”.  
     
      
    109 The appellant submits that the Judge should have gone further and imposed a lesser head sentence and non-parole period having regard to the situation of the daughter even though exceptional hardship was not established. We were referred to the observations of Hodgson JA in R v Girard [2004] NSWCCA 170 at [21]. R v Dib (NSWCCA, Meagher JA, Allen and Badgery-Parker JJ, 13 September 1991 and R v Grbin [2004] NSWCCA 220 were also cited. In my view these matters do not establish error in the present case. Nor do they show that a different sentence ought to have been imposed. 
     
      
    110 I would therefore make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted, but appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    111 JAMES J: I agree with Mason P. 
     
      
    112 HOEBEN J: I agree with Mason P.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      HER HONOUR: 
       
      
    1 On 8 January 2000, Pamela and William Weightman were murdered in their matrimonial home at 98 Abbington Crescent, Glen Alpine. At the time of their death their adopted son, David Weightman, resided with them. He was aged 20. He was the sole beneficiary under their will. The estate was substantial as the deceased had been owner/operators of a childcare centre at the time of their death and owned other unencumbered property including their home. David Weightman is currently serving a sentence of 28 years for the murder of his parents. 
     
      
    2 On 15 October 2007, Terry Mark Donai was convicted of their murder after trial.  
     
      
    3 It was not in dispute at the trial that after the Weightmans were killed their bodies were transported from their home in the family car – a Mitsubishi Magna - to Heathcote National Park where the car was pushed over an embankment running off Heathcote Road onto a fire service road in an attempt to simulate their death in a car accident.  
     
      
    4 What the offender put in issue at trial was his involvement in the murder of the Weightmans and his involvement in the disposition of their bodies after the murder in the manner described. The verdict of the jury resolves both issues against him. Despite the fact that no verdict was entered for the alternate charge of accessory after the fact to murder, I regard the offender’s treatment of the body of the deceased as a relevant matter to be taken into account when assessing the objective seriousness of his offending (see R v Yeo [2003] NSWSC 315 at [36]). 
     
      
       
      The first police investigation 
      
    5 On 9 January 2000, the Mitsubishi was found by a ranger 23 metres over the embankment in the National Park wedged against a tree. He saw William Weightman slumped in the footwell of the driver’s seat and Pamela Weightman in the passenger seat. He believed them to be deceased and alerted the police. The police who attended the scene and removed the bodies from the car later reported to the Coroner that, in their view, there were no suspicious circumstances involved in the death of either the driver or the passenger. On post-mortem examination, the forensic pathologist, Dr Cala, confirmed that view and, on 30 May 2000, he reported to the Coroner that the cause of death of Mrs Weightman was the combined effects of blunt force injury and the aspiration of gastric contents, while the cause of death of Mr Weightman was the combined effects of positional asphyxia and the inhalation of gastric contents. In both cases death was said to be the result of a motor vehicle accident. No inquest was conducted. 
     
      
    6 On 20 January 2000, the deceased were cremated. 
     
      
       
      The second police investigation 
      
    7 In June 2001, Strike Force Tenos was formed to reinvestigate the death of the Weightmans. It would seem that this was the direct result of rumours circulating in the community to the effect that David Weightman and the offender were involved in the death of his parents. It would also appear that the Weightmans’ extended family, in particular Mrs Weightman’s sister, Mrs Margaret Urwin, considered the explanation for their death in a car accident as unlikely in circumstances where Mr Weightman was a notoriously careful driver and where Mrs Weightman had, uncharacteristically, left her wedding ring at the house and the dishes unwashed before travelling at night with her husband. She gave evidence that their death did not “sit well” with her. 
     
      
    8 It was not until May 2003 almost two years later that police involved in Strike Force Tenos revisited the area where the Mitsubishi was found and re-examined the photographs taken at the time with a view to testing Dr Cala’s opinion as to the cause of death. 
     
      
    9 The revised view of police after May 2003 was that the high probabilities favoured the Mitsubishi being manually manoeuvred off the embankment, as distinct from its descent being the result of the driver losing control of the vehicle on Heathcote Road. It was also their view that while some injury to the driver and passenger would be expected in the circumstances, because the point of impact was under low speed, it was improbable that a double fatality would have resulted. 
     
      
    10 Dr Cala’s opinion as to cause of death was then re-examined by two forensic pathologists, Dr Allender and Dr Gall, each of whom came to the considered and independent view that Dr Cala was wrong. In summary, in their view, the cause of death in both cases was asphyxiation. The pattern of bruising and other injuries on the deceased (as reported upon by Dr Cala) was reported by the doctors as consistent with asphyxiating force being applied under pressure and with some resistance being exerted. This was particularly so in the case of Mr Weightman since his hyoid bone was fractured.  11 During the currency of the second police investigation, but before the revised forensic opinions were available, David Weightman was interviewed by police. He denied any involvement in his parents’ death and denied making any statements attributing to him a desire that they be killed in order to secure access to his inheritance.  
     
      
    12 On 19 November 2002, as part of the same police investigation, the offender voluntarily participated in a record of interview with police. He denied any knowledge of, much less any complicity in, the murder of the Weightmans.  
     
      
    13 In light of the jury’s verdict, there is no other conclusion open other than that in the answers he gave to questions asked of him in the interview, and in the information he volunteered to police, he was manipulative and duplicitous. I am satisfied that in that process he revealed himself to be a skilled and capable liar intent on concealing his guilt. He went so far as to express well-tempered indignation at being the subject of suspicion. The following extracts from the interview exemplify that conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you know the names of the Weightmans? 
         
        A. Ah, if you said it I’d know, I just can’t remember now. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. William? 
         
        A. Yeah, I think that was the dad, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Pamela? 
         
        A. Yeah, that’s it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ever meet those two? 
         
        A. Oh yeah, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did you meet them? 
         
        A. I met them, sort of like, Richard and I, we used to go over for a game of pool at Dave’s place and, we were sort of like friends, his family were just beautiful people, fantastic, absolutely fantastic people. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Could you just outline to me the conversation that you had with her surrounding his parents death? 
         
        A. She said, Do you know Dave? I said, Yeah. She goes, Well, I heard that you and Dave killed them. I said, You’ve got to be joking. I said, His parents were just beautiful people. I mean, I cry if someone runs over a fuckin’ blue tongue lizard, why would I kill a human. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say to her at that time? 
         
        A. I said, No way. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Right. 
         
        A. Look my brother even knew, my brother and people in Campbelltown knew this a year before I did about these allegations, I mean it was pretty bloody devastating to find out all these people, all my friends that knew and I knew nothing. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. Did David ever discuss with you when you knew him about killing his parents? 
         
        A. No, not at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was the relationship like between David and his parents? 
         
        A. What I could see fantastic, like a normal son and mother and father. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he close to his parents? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were his parents close to him? 
         
        A. Yeah absolutely. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did they provide for David well? 
         
        A. Yeah, gave him everything he wanted. As far as I know.” 
        
       
      
    14 When asked whether he wished to add anything at the conclusion of the interview he said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. Well, I just hope anything I said today can help you because um, things are a little bit suspicious, you know, it’s not up to me to investigate the crime or anything like that, but things are suspicious. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why, would you say that? 
         
        A. Well, why are you here? 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What’s suspicious in your mind? 
         
        A. The suspicion in my mind, Dave’s got parents, they’ve got a business worth maybe in excess of $700,000, they’ve got a house in excess of half a million dollars, I mean, that could be a good reason to do something if he did do something, but that’s your job to investigate and find out the circumstances.” 
         
        
       
      
    The answers given across the entire interview, together with the manner in which the offender conducted himself, are also material to the assessment I have been invited to make of the offender’s mental state at the time of the murder. In my view, there is nothing in the interview that would suggest that the offender was giving other than careful and considered answers in a deliberate effort to positively mislead police. In particular, there is no indication of any of the clinical features of a psychiatric condition the subject of report by Dr Hampshire, in February 2003, some months later. The offender spoke of his work as a concreter, his responsibilities for the care of his son, his living arrangements at the time of the Weightmans’ death (by what he described as a tragic accident) and that he associated with a select group of close friends. He told police that David Weightman was an acquaintance with whom he had no continuing connection. I will return to consider Dr Hampshire’s report and its weight in the current proceedings later in this judgment. 
     
      
      The evidence of Ms Byron, Ms Harrison and Ms Stoyles 
       
      
    15 Each of Ms Byrson, Ms Harrison and Ms Stoyles gave evidence at the offender’s trial. Their evidence concerned observations of the offender before he was interviewed by police in November 2002. However, consistently with his attitude and demeanour at that time, there is nothing in their observations of him at an earlier point in time to suggest any psychiatric condition or mood disorder of the kind to which Dr Hampshire referred. Their independent observations of him reveal the offender as cynical, cool and calculated. 
     
      
    16 Ms Kaye Lea Byron was in a relationship with the offender from 1995 to approximately 1999. She understood that the offender and Weightman were friends and that the offender had done some work on the Weightmans’ driveway before their death. Ms Byron recalled attending the Weightmans’ funeral service and their wake with the offender. She was told that the Weightmans had been involved in a car accident. Some days after the funeral service she was taken by the offender, together with his son, to a location on Heathcote Road where the accident was said to have occurred. The offender told her that David Weightman had provided him with the precise location of the accident. Ms Byron recalled that at the crash site the offender searched for reasons as to how the car could have swerved off the road and ended up at the bottom of the embankment. He also made the observation that there were no skid marks on the road. 
     
      
    17 Ms Paula Harrison, who was a friend of Ms Byron’s, was introduced to the offender at her café in Berridale. She gave evidence that in 2000 the offender visited her café with another adult man who she came to know as “David”. She overheard a conversation they were having in relation to the death of the Weightmans. She recalled them saying that the Weightmans had been drugged and were killed by another vehicle. She also recalled the two of them discussing the couple’s wealth in that they had lots of money and cars and owned a childcare centre. The offender also told her that David was giving him his late mother’s car. Ms Harrison said that in this conversation the offender “had a smirk” and that the other man appeared to be expressing no signs of sympathy or remorse. There can be no doubt that the person “David” is David Weightman and that he and the offender were discussing the murder they had committed. 
     
      
    18 Ms Merilene Louise Stoyles was in a relationship with the offender between May 2000 and August 2000. She gave evidence in relation to various phone calls the offender made to David Weightman in an effort to recover money the offender told Ms Stoyles he had lent him so that he could help pay for his parents’ funeral expenses. This was a blatant lie. It is clear from the evidence of the Urwins that they provided the money for the funeral expenses. The offender also approached Mr and Mrs Urwin for money on the pretext of having lent money to David Weightman to buy a motorbike that he was refusing to repay. I am satisfied that the money that the offender was pursuing David Weightman for, and the money he was seeking to extract from the Urwins, represented the payment that David Weightman had promised the offender in exchange for killing his parents. 
     
      
       
      David Weightman confesses  
      
    19 On 1 February 2004, David Weightman confessed to Mrs Urwin that he had killed his parents. He named the offender as having participated in the murder with him. He confirmed this account to police and voluntarily participated in a record of interview the following day in which he detailed the circumstances in which he and the offender agreed that his parents would be murdered, the planning involved in achieving that objective, the method by which the murder was to be carried out and the means taken to conceal it.  
     
      
    20 In summary, he told police that the offender had proposed that his parents be killed (although he was by no means averse to the idea, being desirous of securing access to their estate) and that it was agreed that to facilitate their death by suffocation/asphyxiation he would first sedate them with tablets the offender would obtain for that purpose. He said that he made it clear to the offender that he did not want to perform any physical role in the killing. The use of the sedative was designed to both ensure that his parents would not suffer and that the offender would be able to asphyxiate his parents without his assistance. To this end, he told police, it was agreed that he would mix the sedative the offender would get for him in a cup of tea that he would offer to make for his parents on his arrival home on the evening designated for their killing and that the offender would soon thereafter enter the house and kill them. It was then agreed that his parents’ death would be simulated by a car accident and plans were made, to that end, to move and dispose of the bodies. The offender was to be paid $17,000 for his assistance.  
     
      
    21 David Weightman participated in a “walk through“ at his previous family home. The jury were made aware of this however the video recording of the “walk through” was not tendered in evidence. The Crown has not sought to tender it on sentence. David Weightman also took police to the area at Heathcote where he and the offender pushed his parents’ car over the embankment. He confirmed to police that his parents were already deceased at that time. Only a portion of this video recording was tendered in the trial. 
     
      
       
      David Weightman’s sentence proceedings 
       
      
    22 On 10 October 2005, David Weightman entered a plea of guilty to the murder of his parents. On 23 December 2005 he was sentenced by Hidden J to 28 years imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of 22 years. Although his Honour found that the murders were premeditated and committed for financial gain at a level of objective seriousness calling for condign punishment, his Honour discounted the sentence otherwise to be imposed by 30 per cent for the combined value of the plea of guilty and Weightman’s assistance to the authorities. The assistance was constituted by Weightman admitting his own involvement in the death of his parents and agreeing to give evidence against this offender. His Honour also took into account Weightman’s psychiatric condition as he presented at the time of sentence. Doctors Canaris and Allnut reported that the offender gave a history of polydrug abuse, and auditory and visual hallucinations from about the age of eighteen. Dr Canaris reported that the history was consistent with chronic schizophrenia. Dr Allnut was somewhat less specific in that he regarded Weightman as suffering from a chronic psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. His Honour also accepted the Crown Prosecutor’s concession that Weightman might have been in an early phase of the development of a mental illness at the time of the killings which took the case out of the category of murder calling for a life sentence pursuant to s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”).  
     
      
    23 David Weightman admitted in his evidence at the offender’s trial that he had deliberately misled the physiatrists into accepting his false report of a history of psychotic episodes, and that he did so deliberately in an effort to reduce his sentence. Since the integrity of the doctors’ diagnoses must necessarily be undermined as a consequence of Weightman’s evidence, and, by necessary extension, that the leniency extended by his Honour on sentence was undeserved, nevertheless because of Weightman’s plea of guilty, his assistance and prospects of rehabilitation as found by the sentencing judge, the principle of parity cannot have any legitimate application to the sentence of this offender. 
     
      
    24 On the application of the prosecuting authorities David Weightman’s sentence proceeding and outcome were suppressed from publication. This was in order to allow the police to pursue an undercover operation, as part of Strike Force Tenos, with a view to having this offender reveal his complicity in the murder of the Weightmans on the pretext of being recruited as a member of an underworld gang who, he was led to believe, were a successful group of professional criminals, accomplished across a range of criminal activities including contract killing. I venture the view that this evidence-gathering technique was adopted because of concerns about David Weightman’s evidence being uncorroborated given the passage of time since the killing, and where, because of the erroneous finding as to cause of death, any prospect of scientific evidence being collected from the crime scene had been lost. 
     
      
       
      The second arm of the police investigation 
       
      
    25 The arm of the second police investigation commenced in March 2004 and extended up until the date of the offender’s arrest on 16 June 2006 when he revealed to the undercover operatives his involvement in the disposition of the bodies of Mr and Mrs Weightman after they had been killed, on his account, by David Weightman.  
     
      
    26 I described the technique employed by the undercover operation in R v Donai (New South Wales Supreme Court, 2 October 2007, unreported) in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “…an undercover operative meets and befriends a suspect portraying himself (or herself) as an important member of a fictitious criminal organisation. The objective in so doing is to solicit the suspect’s trust on the basis that once mutual trust was established the suspect would be introduced to the head of the organisation, the “Boss”, as a suitable candidate for acceptance as a member of the criminal organisation with a view to being employed by it. “The technique” involves setting up a number of what are called ‘criminal scenarios’ calculated to allow the accused to prove that he or she is willing to commit criminal offences and can be trusted. The ultimate object of the strategy is to secure from the accused information about the crime of crimes he or she is suspected of having committed since ‘the Boss’ of the fictitious criminal organisation would demand absolute honesty and a frank revelation of past criminal conduct in exchange for membership of the organisation.” 
        
       
      
    To facilitate the execution of this “technique”, between April 2004 and February 2006, police applied for and were granted several telephone interception warrants and five further listening device warrants. 
     
      
    27 Only a small part of the electronic material generated from the face-to-face and telephone contact between the offender and various undercover operatives over the course of the operation was tendered in evidence. In that evidence however the offender is made aware that the underworld “Boss” insists on being informed of all criminal conduct in which the offender has engaged in the past. This, he was told, was to ensure that there would be no unwanted or unmanageable police attention on him or his activities and as confirmation of his willingness and capacity to act criminally thus confirming his utility as a new recruit to the criminal organisation. I will have something more to say about this evidence later in this judgment since the offender’s stated willingness in 2005 to kill again under contract is relevant to the criteria to be considered under s 61(1) of the Act.  
     
      
       
      The trial 
       
      
    28 On 17 September 2007, the offender pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging him with the murder of Pamela and William Weightman and, in the alternative, being an accessory after the fact to their murder. 
     
      
    29 On 15 October 2007, he was convicted by a jury of their murder. By their verdict, the jury must be taken to have rejected the offender’s admission to the undercover operatives to being only an accessory after the fact to the murder of the Weightmans, and to have accepted David Weightman’s evidence, to the criminal standard, that the offender was involved as a principal in their death together with being involved in the disposition of their bodies as part of the execution of their joint plan. 
     
      
    30 The offender did not give evidence at trial and has given no evidence in the sentence proceedings. He has at no time acknowledged his guilt or expressed any remorse. 
     
      
       
      The sentence proceedings 
       
      
    31 The sentence proceeding was originally listed for hearing on 30 November 2007. On that date it was adjourned as a result of an application by the New South Wales Commissioner of Police for leave to appeal against a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal confirming the correctness of an interlocutory ruling I had made in the course of the trial concerning the suppression of the evidence of the undercover operation to which I have earlier referred: see R v Donai (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Fullerton J, 2 October 2007, unreported); Attorney General for NSW v Nationwide News Pty Limited Anor [2007] NSWCCA 307. 
     
      
    32 The matter was re-listed for hearing on 29 February 2008. On that date Mr Flynn of counsel who had appeared at trial announced that his instructions had been withdrawn. The offender sought an adjournment to allow him to seek legal advice and to retain alternate lawyers.  
     
      
    33 On 14 March 2008, Mr Jeffreys appeared and sought a further adjournment to allow him time to familiarise himself with the evidence at trial and to confirm his instructions. The proceedings were adjourned for mention until 4 April 2008 and, on that date, I fixed the date for the sentence hearing as 16 May 2008.  
     
      
    34 On 4 April 2008, Mr Jeffreys informed me that detailed enquiries were to be made of the New South Wales Police Service in respect of a matter that would, or might, have a direct bearing on psychiatric evidence that was to be tendered before me on sentence. In the result there was no evidence forthcoming from the Police Service substantiating a complaint by the offender to having been sexually abused as a schoolboy. The matter was further adjourned to 23 April 2008. On that day the matter was again adjourned for mention until 1 May 2008 when I again confirmed 16 May 2008 as the date of the sentence hearing. 
     
      
    35 The evidence relied upon by the Crown on sentence consisted primarily of the evidence adduced at trial, in particular the evidence of David Weightman and the transcript of evidence of the undercover operation. The Crown also formally tendered the offender’s criminal antecedents. I consider that in the circumstances they are irrelevant to this sentencing exercise. They relate to relatively minor matters in the scale of criminal offences relative to these offences. On the other hand, the offender does not receive the benefit of a prior unblemished criminal record, or prior good character, since he has admitted to undercover police that he had been involved in a range of criminal activities, albeit uncharged, over many years. 
     
      
    36 During the course of sentence proceedings Margaret Urwin and Alan Urwin read out victim impact statements that were also formally tendered. Mrs Urwin described her sister as an irreplaceable family member and her and her husband as valued citizens stolen from her. I am satisfied that this has occasioned her the deepest grief and has been productive of deep and enduring trauma which has shattered her family and caused a breakdown in her marriage. Her determination to salvage her faith in human kindness is a measure of her strength and her fortitude in the face of loss. On behalf of himself and his family, Mr Urwin, seeks emotional closure and asks this court to ensure that justice is done. This sentencing exercise is directed to imposing a sentence of imprisonment on this offender that will, in my assessment, meet what the community can and should expect from a system of justice that is as responsive to the community it serves as it is to the established principles of law that have developed to give consistency to its expression. I extend my sympathies to Mr and Mrs Urwin and their family. 
     
      
    37 Mr Jeffreys tendered the following material: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) A report of Dr Hampshire dated 3 February 2003; 
         
        (2) A report of Dr Hampshire dated 15 May 2008; 
         
        (3) Four letters: 
         
         (i) Neil Harrigan, Director of Centacare, to John Usher also a director of Centacare dated 21 July 1996; 
         
         (ii) John Usher to Peter Donnan of the Catholic Education Office dated 23 August 1996; 
         
         (iii) John Usher to Peter Donnan dated 15 January 1997; 
         
         (iv) Anne Donai dated 16 July 2002. 
         
        (4) A report of Dr Carne dated 27 November 2007; and 
         
        (5) A statement of Rennie Georgia Kathleen employed by the NSW Police Services as Team Leader of the High Risk Records Repository and a statement of Senior Constable Sue-Anne Smith.  
        
       
      
    38 Dr Hampshire was not required to attend for cross-examination. 
     
      
       
      The facts upon which sentence is to be passed 
       
      
    39 In every case, whether after trial or after a plea of guilty has been entered, it is critical to the determination of an appropriate sentence that the sentencing judge finds the facts upon which sentence is to be passed and clearly identifies them so that the basis upon which sentence is passed is made manifest (see GAS v The Queen [2004] HCA 22; 217 CLR 198 at [30]). In some cases the facts are a matter of agreement between the parties or, after a jury verdict, the facts may be so patent from the evidence led at trial that the factual basis for sentence is not the subject of contest. 
     
      
    40 This case does not fall into either category. Therefore, in accordance with established principles, and consistently with the jury's verdict, I must set out my findings of the facts material to the sentencing exercise. I am mindful that the offender is to be given the benefit of any reasonable doubt I might have as to those facts (see R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWR 374). There can be no other category of case where the task of fact finding that falls to a sentencing judge has greater impact than one where the Crown submits that life sentences should be imposed.  
     
      
    41 Mr Jeffreys urged me to make factual findings that would serve to elevate the role that David Weightman played in the death of his parents. In particular, he submitted that I should not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his client was the initiator or instigator of the plan to murder the Weightmans since David Weightman, according to the evidence, had been speaking freely of his interest in seeing his parents dead for some months prior to their ultimate demise, and some time prior to a close relationship developing with the offender. Mr Jeffreys submitted that David Weightman falsely attributed the role of instigator to this offender and that, consistently with the jury’s verdict, it was open for me to find that the offender was merely present at the scene of the crime at Weightman’s invitation and that he assisted him to kill for reward. In considering that question, Mr Jeffreys urged me to take into account David Weightman’s conduct in his own sentence proceeding where he attracted undeserved leniency from a judge of this Court by his deliberate manipulation of the forensic process.  
     
      
    42 On the other hand, I am invited by the Crown to proceed to sentence on the basis that the evidence David Weightman gave at the trial was evidence upon which I could rely and that the offender was a person who took an opportunistic advantage of a misguided and vulnerable younger person in David Weightman in proposing and planning a murder for his own cynical financial ends. The Crown submitted that the chilling account given by David Weightman to the jury of his fervent wish to see his parents dead so that he could inherit their wealth and spend it without restriction (but that he was unable to kill them himself), coupled with his equally chilling desire that they should not suffer in the course of being murdered (or for one to survive the other), was ample evidence that he was honestly recounting the events leading up to the murder and the role the offender played in seeing the murder committed. The Crown submitted that I should find that David Weightman could never have committed the crime without the offender’s willingness to do the killing and by offering his additional guarantees that it would be a success by planning the killing, providing the sedatives and styling the simulated car accident. 
     
      
    43 In circumstances where the offender has not given any account of his dealings with David Weightman leading up to the murder, much less any account of the role he was asked to play, and did in fact play, in the killing of David Weightman’s parents, the only evidence bearing upon those particular matters is in the evidence of Weightman at trial.  
     
      
    44 I do not regard the fact that David Weightman had expressed a desire to others that his parents be killed as inconsistent with the account he gave of how it came to pass that the offender joined with him in bringing about that result. This is exemplified in the following extract. 
     
      
    45 David Weightman said that whilst on a trip with the offender to Jindabyne he had a conversation with the offender in relation to his parents’ financial situation in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did you say about to Terry about your parents? 
         
        A. I said to Terry something about how they have got the preschool and they have got the two cars and the house. He was like, “Well, what happens if they die?” And I said, “Well, I get everything, being the only child”. We sort of left it there. I mean, we sort of talked about it on the way back to Campbelltown, but it wasn’t a major thing. It was a surface conversation. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say you talked about it on the way back to Campbelltown, what did you talk about? 
         
        A. We talked about things like if they were to have died, not so much when we kill them, but if they were to have died, then what would you do with your share of the dosh, like what bike would you buy. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who said that? 
         
        A. It was Terry. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you remember the exact words he said in that context? 
         
        A. I can’t recall word for word. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can you try to say, in the same words that he used as though you’re Terry, what he said about the money and the bikes or what bike would you get? 
         
        A. Sorry, yeah, it was brought up about a Hayabusa. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Would you kindly spell that? 
         
        A. Gee, H-A-Y-A-B-U-Z-A. That’s just a guess. But yeah, that was at the time the fastest bike in the world. It was a 1300. It does 340 kilometres. Yeah, it was the beez neez at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did Terry say about the Hayabusa? 
         
        A. That he liked it. It is a big person’s bike. I can certainly ride it, but, you know, my sort of frame, I am a little bit short, whereas his sort of frame would fit, and were just talking about that.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    46 The evidence continued in the following manner: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Mr Weightman, just returning to the conversation that you had with Terry Donai coming back up from Jindabyne after you stayed at his place, how did that conversation arise? Did you start it or did he? 
         
        A. He started it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember what he said? 
         
        A. Yeah, it started with, “Oh, if your parents die, what would you get?” And my answer was, “Everything, being the only child”. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did he say then? 
         
        A. It was – it was just, I don’t know, a bit of a look, and it was like, “Oh, so what have you got?” by me saying “Everything”, that was a bit vague and I went into detail, “a business, the double-storey house in Glen Alpine, the two cars, the whole lot”. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said something about motorbikes or a motorbike, what was that? 
         
        A. Yeah, well he said – he said, “What bike would I get?” I had my eye on the Ducati 996 – oh sorry, it was the Ducati 916 at the time. I mean they weren’t cheap, they were about 25, 35,000. He started talking about the Hayabusa. It turned – it sort of went from there as in, “Oh, well, if something happened, if I took care of them, then, I would want payment of the Hayabusa”. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Sorry who said that? 
         
        A. Terry did.” 
        
       
      
    47 David Weightman also gave evidence of talking to the offender on the same topic a couple of days before the murder. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. … “Yeah, I’ll drug them and put them out, yeah”… 
        
       
       
        
        Q. “I’ll drug them” and? 
         
        A. And like get rid of them, you know what I mean, like, I don’t know exactly how, but he was saying that he’d drug them and I said – I said, “Okay”. Well, that was – that was like the first step, by him saying, “I’ll drug them”.” 
        
       
      
    48 I am satisfied that despite David Weightman’s obvious capacity to deceive doctors and the sentencing judge, his disclosure in the offender’s trial that his intentions were to achieve selfish ends, with no apparent shame, is illustrative not of his capacity for showmanship or fine acting (as Mr Jeffreys submitted) but a demonstration of extraordinarily guile. It did nothing, however, in my view to diminish the force of his evidence implicating the offender. 
     
      
    49 I am satisfied, having regard to the evidence of David Weightman, that upon arrival at his parents’ home at about 8:30pm on 8 January 2000, Weightman prepared two cups of tea surreptitiously adding a number of Serepax tablets. At this time the offender was outside the house effectively in hiding. The cup of tea that the co-offender made for his mother was either taken to her upstairs in the master bedroom where she was lying, or was given to her in the lounge room downstairs, which she then took upstairs. Weightman gave his father his cup of tea in the lounge room. He then went outside to where the offender was waiting to advise him of what he had done. I am satisfied that when the offender entered the house, leaving David Weightman outside, Pamela Weightman was lying on the bed in the master bedroom. The offender entered her bedroom and applied a pillow to her face under sustained pressure resulting in her asphyxiation. Given the toxicological report following autopsy she was unlikely to have been even mildly sedated when the offender fatally assaulted her. This is consistent with David Weightman’s evidence that he heard “a bit of a scream” emanating from his parents’ bedroom when he was outside the house.  
     
      
    50 Whilst it is not clear whether William Weightman heard his wife’s scream, it would appear that he did not react to it. This may have been because of the sedative effect of the Serepax detected at post-mortem which was, in his case, within the therapeutic range. 
     
      
    51 I am satisfied that the offender then proceeded downstairs (leaving the deceased Pamela Weightman upstairs) to enlist David Weightman’s assistance to kill his father since the method of killing proved more difficult than the offender had apparently hoped or expected. David Weightman gave the following account in his evidence at the offender’s trial: 
     
      
       
        
        “So I’m there having a cigarette and I’ve looked up and I’ve just heard a bit of a scream and next thing I know Terry comes downstairs, opens the door and he’s all – he’s all out of breath and he’s sweating, I don’t know, I – I guess you would say stinking like death, do you know what I mean? And he was like, “Gee, you know, that really took a lot out of me. I need a hand with your dad”. And I went, “Oh shit” because – because I certainly didn’t want to be involved and like I was – my heart was racing just because I heard my mum scream and that was the point I knew it had gone so far and I couldn’t turn back from that, so…”  
        
       
      
    52 I am satisfied that the offender placed a pillow over William Weightman’s face while David Weightman took hold of his father’s legs and pinned him to the lounge. William Weightman struggled but was eventually subdued and asphyxiated. 
     
      
    53 Both men then carried the bodies of the deceased from the house to the garage where they were placed into the Mitsubishi. Pamela Weightman was placed in a seated position in the front passenger seat while William Weightman was placed across the backseat. The offender drove the car to the location off Heathcote Road where the bodies were to be left while David Weightman followed in his mother’s white Hyundai coupe.  
     
      
    54 In the result, I am satisfied that the offender not only killed Pamela Weightman by his own hand and, together with David Weightman, killed her husband shortly thereafter, but that he performed a crucial role in transporting the deceased’s bodies and positioning the body of William Weightman in the driver’s foot well before the car was pushed over the embankment. I am satisfied that the offender and David Weightman then left the area together in the white coupe. There being no evidence to the contrary, I am satisfied they returned to the Weightman’s home and had a beer before playing a game of pool. 
     
      
       
      Relevant principles 
       
      
    55 By reason of the fact that the offender was convicted of two counts of murder it is necessary for me to have regard to s 19A of the Crimes Act 1900 and ss 21 and 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    56 Section 19A of the Crimes Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life.  
         
        (2) A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life.  
         
        (3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 21 (1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
        (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life).”  
        
       
      
    57 Section 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.  
         
        (2) If by any provision of an Act or statutory rule an offender is made liable to imprisonment for a specified term, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term.” 
        
       
      
    58 Section 61 of that Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    59 In Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; 164 A Crim R 126, McClellan CJ at CL said the following at [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 61(1) has been the subject of consideration in a number of decisions. It is not necessary to analyse them for present purposes beyond a statement of the following principles: 
         
        · the maximum penalty for an offence in the case of murder, life imprisonment, is intended for cases falling within the worst category of case for which that penalty is prescribed:  
        Ibbs v The Queen [1987] HCA 46;  
        (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452. 
         
        · it is not possible to prescribe a list of cases falling within the worst category – ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness:  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14;  
        (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 478; 
         R v Petroff  
        (unreported, 12 November 1991 – Hunt CJ at CL). 
         
        · a life sentence is not reserved only for those cases where the offender is likely to remain a continuing danger to society for the rest of his or her life or for cases where there is no chance of rehabilitation; the maximum may be appropriate where the level of culpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution and punishment can only be met by a sentence of life imprisonment;  
        R v Kalazich  
        (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 at (50-1);  
        R v Baker  
        (unreported, CCA 20 September 1995); 
         R v Garforth  
        (unreported CCA 23 May 1994). 
         
        · in many cases a two stage approach to the consideration of whether the maximum penalty should be imposed is appropriate. Firstly, consideration is given to whether the objective gravity of the offence brings it within the worst class of case and then consideration is given to whether the subjective circumstances of the offender require a lesser sentence:  
        R v Bell  
        (1985) 2 NSWLR 466; 
         R v Valera  
        [2002] NSWCCA 50. 
         
        · it is the combined effect of the four indicia in s 61(1) which is critical:  
        R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19;  
        (2004) 59 NSWLR 557.  
         
        · the absence of any one or more of the indicia of retribution, punishment, community protection or deterrence may make it more difficult for a sentencing judge to reach the conclusion that a life sentence is required although will not be determinative:  
        Merritt  
        at 559.” 
        
       
      
    60 The Crown submitted that it has discharged the burden of establishing that this case meets the criteria set out in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to the criminal standard: see The Queen v Olbrich [1999] HCA 54; 199 CLR 270. I acknowledge that, even were I satisfied that s 61(1) criteria have been met, I have a discretion pursuant to s 21(1) of the Act to impose a lesser sentence where an offender’s subjective circumstances justify a lesser sentence than one of life imprisonment.  
     
      
    61 In R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 557, Wood CJ at CL (Tobias JA and Hidden JA agreeing) held that the primary focus of s 61(1) is the extremity of the offender’s culpability such that a sentence of life imprisonment is required to be imposed. If the culpability is so extreme that the community’s interest in any combination of retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence could only be met with the imposition of a life sentence then that sentence should be passed (subject only to the discretion to which I have referred). I also note that the absence of any one of the criteria is not determinative although it may make the conclusion that a life sentence is required more difficult. 
     
      
    62 In determining the extent of the offender’s culpability in this case, in my view, each of the four statutory preconditions present some degree of extremity, although not to the same degree. 
     
      
      The objective seriousness 
       
      
    63 The degree of criminality involved in the death of the Weightmans is, in my view, of a very high order. Two completely innocent people in loving union with each other and (in what they would have been forgiven for thinking was) a loving communion with their adopted son, were murdered cruelly and callously in their own home by the joint and concerted efforts of their son and this offender. This offender was a man who they had welcomed into their home as their son’s friend and someone who they trusted sufficiently to employ to perform some home improvement work on their driveway in the week leading up to their death. He was paid for his work. It cannot be ignored for sentencing purposes that this offender not only killed once, with the responsibility for the death of Mrs Weightman literally fresh on his hands, before he killed without compunction a second time. The extent of this offender’s blatant disregard for common decency and his patent disrespect for the integrity and sanctity of human life is breathtaking. It cannot be forgotten or underestimated for sentencing purposes that he agreed to kill two people for a sum of $17,000. I do not regard it as in anyway relevant that David Weightman did not ultimately pay the offender for the role he performed in killing his parents and disposing of their bodies notwithstanding his undertaking to do so. Whatever that may reveal about David Weightman, it does nothing to either aggravate the offender’s culpability or mitigate it. It is simply one of the features of this case that is as disturbing as it is unfathomable. 
     
      
    64 That said, I am not satisfied that this case falls within the worst category of homicide or the most extreme case, although it falls very close to it. I am conscious in so saying that it is not simply because a worse case of contract killing can be envisaged but rather because this case, whilst premeditated and planned, was nevertheless unprofessional and, to an extent, amateurish. Were it not for the forensic ineptitude of some of the state officials who dealt with the deceased after their bodies were located on 9 January 2000, this offender (and his co-offender) would likely have been brought to justice much earlier. This would have at least saved the sustained pain and suffering that Mr and Mrs Urwin have suffered over the past eight and a half years, two people, who to their credit have maintained their resolve to see justice done. 
     
      
    65 It is clear that premeditation alone does not necessarily place a case in the worst category (see for example, R v Chetcuti, Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 December 1993, unreported, referred to in the case of Burrell v R [2007] NSWCCA 65 at [327]) neither for that matter neither does the fact that the motivation for killing was financial (see R v Willard [2005] NSWSC 402; R v Mrish, Hidden J, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 13 December 1996, unreported; and Chetcuti). In the case of Chetcuti for example, the sentencing judge was satisfied to the criminal standard that Mr Chetcuti abducted his ex-wife against her will, drove her to the Parramatta Lakes Reserve, hit her on the head several times with a heavy object intending to kill her and whilst she was unconscious but still alive placed three rocks weighing a total of about 11 kilograms inside her clothing to weigh her body down. He then put her weighted unconscious body in the water of an inlet at Parramatta Lakes. His motivation was not financial. His motivation was to prevent his ex-wife from pursuing an application against him in the Family Court which he feared might result in him losing some of his property. A determinate sentence was imposed. Although the case was decided, both at first instance and on appeal, prior to the passage of s 61(1) of the Act, it is nevertheless indicative of the fact that there are cases which are gross in the extreme in terms of the extent of premeditation and the motive behind the murder where the maximum penalty has not been imposed. I should acknowledge, however, as was noted by McClellan CJ at CL in Burrell that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…there are other decisions of this Court which would point in a different direction. Contract killings have been found to fall in the worst category of case (see  
        Cross 
        , Grove J, unreported, 6 December 1996) where his Honour said that “a deliberate killing for payment would prima facie finds its place in the worst category of case with the potential for the imposition of the maximum penalty.” Hunt CJ at CL in  
        Kalejich  
        (1997) 94 A Crim R 41 said that he agreed with this statement although recognising that there may be contract killings which in all of the circumstances would not attract the maximum penalty (at 52).” 
        
       
      
    66 The real question it seems to me is whether or not there is any basis for this offender being described as other than a killer under contract. I am satisfied that there is none. These offences were committed by the offender opportunistically and for money. Despite the fact that it was the deceased’s son who was promoting the concept of killing his parents for their estate rather than this offender seeking him out or being engaged by him as a professional killer, I am satisfied that this offender proposed the method of killing and the means of its successful execution in the expectation that he would receive a reward and, as the evidence reveals, he took steps over many months after the death to extract what he regarded as due to him. 
     
      
       
      The evidence from the psychiatrist 
        
       
      
    67 In coming to a conclusion about the degree of objective criminality involved in the commission of an offence, the mental state of an offender is of relevance even where that mental state may not have been of the nature or of the degree that would have provided a defence at law. The appropriate principles to be applied have been defined in many cases. As McClellan CJ at CL observed in Knight at [40], mental illness may result in a sentence where less weight is given to specific or general deterrence (see R v Benitez [2006] NSWCCA 21; 160 A Crim R 166), it may also be relevant to a consideration of matters of retribution or the need for treatment outside the prison system (see R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67). In each case, however, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence is necessary. A mental illness may also be taken into account in appropriate cases where the mere fact of the imposition of a prison term may prove more onerous for a person suffering such an illness.  
     
      
    68 Mr Jeffreys submitted that, on the evidence in this case, I should be satisfied on the probabilities that at the time of the murder in January 2000 the offender was suffering from a permanent and underlying psychiatric condition which impaired his capacity for judgment, inclusive of his capacity to control his thoughts, feelings and behaviour. This was the opinion expressed by Dr Robert Hampshire in a report dated 15 May 2008, that is, almost eight and a half years after the offence. In that report doctor referred to an earlier report he prepared at the request of Marsdens Law Group in February 2003 in support of a civil claim for damages that the offender was considering bringing against the Catholic Education Department for breach of their duty to him as a schoolboy. 
     
      
    69 The 2008 report extracts the entirety of the 2003 report. It is relied upon by the doctor as basing his opinion as to the offender’s current psychiatric condition and impaired capacities, a condition Dr Hampshire opines he suffered from at the time of what he describes as “the behaviours for which he is currently before the Courts”. It is necessary then that I refer to that earlier report. 
     
      
    70 In February 2003, Dr Hampshire diagnosed the offender as suffering from a severe post traumatic stress disorder with secondary disorders all of which had their origins in his primary psychiatric condition. In the doctor’s opinion, the disorder arose directly as a result of the offender being sexually abused whilst attending a Catholic school in Kingsgrove when he was 10 years of age. It is clear from the report that the offender reported to Dr Hampshire predatory behaviour by one of his teachers which involved him being sexually assaulted on a daily basis over a six-month period. It is also clear that it was not until conferring with Dr Hampshire in 2003 that he sought any clinical intervention. Indeed he made no complaint at all until 1996. He left the school in Kingsgrove and continued his schooling at Fort Street Primary School in Lewisham. His behaviour deteriorated to a point where a propensity for violence marked his schooling from that point and throughout his first year at Glebe High School. Halfway through his second year at High School he changed to St Mary’s Cathedral School where although his behaviour improved he was unable to apply himself to his studies, finally leaving school in the middle of year nine. 
     
      
    71 The offender then goes on to report to Dr Hampshire being employed in the security industry and as a day labourer although various forms of antisocial behaviour continued to manifest themselves in the form of substance abuse and street fighting. He also reported various difficulties encountered in forming sustained sexual relationships and in his sexual performance generally. He reported that the sexual and physical abuse at the hands of his school master dominated his thinking patterns and, from around 30 years of age (2-3 years before the murder of the Weightmans), he was claiming daily flashbacks which manifested as panic attacks making him feel extremely anxious and fearful. He said they were occurring on a weekly basis although they had diminished in the years leading up to the preparation of the 2003 report. He also reported to doctor that around the age of 30 he was suffering a period of severe depression and that he recalls feeling suicidal and trying to overdose on pills. He said he lost his appetite, his libido and had an exacerbation of low levels of concentration and attention. Doctor also reported that his avoidance of friends and family was exacerbated by prolonged periods of disassociation including a global sense of fear that other people were out to get him, take advantage of him or use him. 
     
      
    72 In so far as his future intentions and perspectives were concerned in 2003, he told Dr Hampshire that he frequently isolated himself in the mountains, often on horseback or driving for hours to sit by a creek. He said, “I’m worried, but I just want a good future. Depends on how I tackle it. I must put my past behind me. I just can’t focus”. On clinical examination in 2003, doctor regarded his mood as depressed, paranoid, angry, sad and anxious.  
     
      
    73 Significantly of course, Dr Hampshire was not informed by the offender of the fact that he had murdered Mr and Mrs Weightman in January 2000 in perpetration of a plan by which he planned to benefit financially, or that he had been the subject of a police investigation after rumours surfaced suggestive of his involvement. 
     
      
    74 There is nothing in the 2003 report, in my view, that sheds any light at all on the offender’s psychiatric state at the time of the murders such as to ameliorate the objective seriousness of his culpability for murder. While I have no basis for rejecting the offender’s account to Dr Hampshire of having been sexually abused 25 years earlier, or concluding that he exaggerated ongoing psychiatric or psychological sequelae to mount a claim for damages, it cannot be overlooked that the offender has not attested to the truth of the matters reported to Dr Hampshire in the sentence proceedings, much less given any evidence enabling me to make an assessment of the impact of his past mistreatment on his conduct or state of mind at the time of the murders. 
     
      
    75 Dr Hampshire next saw the offender on 6 May 2008 almost 7 months after verdict. He was asked at that time (for entirely unexplained reasons) to examine him for the purpose of determining whether he had a defence under s 23A of the Crimes Act. Doctor offered the view that a defence was in fact available. He was apparently not told that a jury had convicted the offender in September 2007. Indeed it is not even clear from doctor’s report that he was informed of the allegation that the offender had killed the Weightmans, much less the facts and circumstances of the killings as revealed by the evidence. 
     
      
    76 On clinical examination at the prison on 6 May 2008, Dr Hampshire found the offender as little changed from when he last saw him five years earlier. He described his mood as composed, insightful, somewhat introspective, brooding, resentful and sad, mood states which doctor seems to suggest arise as a result of his current situation. What “that situation” includes beyond being in custody, is not made clear. Doctor regards what he describes as the offender’s pre-morbid personality structure such that, “the evidence surrounding the murder could have been viewed with more detail” were it known. Whatever Dr Hampshire might mean by those remarks, for my part, in the absence of Dr Hampshire being informed of the facts and circumstances surrounding the murder of Mr and Mrs Weightman, and, as importantly, the observed behaviour of the offender before the murder, at the time of the murder, and following the murder extending over some years, I am unable to give any weight to Dr Hampshire’s diagnosis either in 2003 or in 2008 in the sentencing process. I do not regard either of his diagnoses as explaining or giving context to the offending for which the offender stands to be sentenced, or mitigating the level of culpability reflected in that offending. At no time does Dr Hampshire explain the basis for his opinion that the offender’s capacity for judgment and self-control was impaired or how the post traumatic stress disorder, as the underlying psychiatric condition, had the effect of diminishing his culpability notwithstanding the fact that at the outset of the 2008 report he undertakes doing so. This is likely explained by the fact that either he was not informed of the circumstances in which the murders were committed and the role the offender played, or that he did not discuss those matters with the offender or, given the offender’s continued silence, the offender refused to discuss these matters with the doctor much less acknowledge his guilt. 
     
      
       
      Risk to community and future dangerousness 
       
      
    77 While acknowledging the high level of criminal culpability in the conduct of the offender, Mr Jeffreys submitted that the sentencing criteria in s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were not met and, further, that the sentencing objectives of retribution, punishment and deterrence could be satisfied by the imposition of a lengthy sentence but one which fell short of an imposition of a life sentence. Mr Jeffreys argued that this was particularly the case in circumstances where I would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender posed a continuing danger to the community such as to require its protection by his detention in custody for life. He submitted that this was so notwithstanding the fact that in 2005, in the course of the undercover operation, the offender admitted a willingness to kill again, albeit preferring that it be someone he didn’t know and imposing the limitation that he would not kill a child. Mr Jeffreys asked me to find that the circumstances in which those remarks were made were such as to seriously undermine their reliability as an indicator of the offender’s true future intentions or dangerousness. He submitted that the structure of the undercover operation and the offender’s engagement with the undercover operatives over a lengthy period ran the risk of encouraging, if not soliciting, an overstatement of the offender’s capacity to do what was asked of him because of the very substantial rewards that he was promised. He also submitted the reliability of what the offender agreed he would or might do should be viewed with some caution in circumstances where he was being psychologically manipulated by police officers and where the police officers were being advised by psychologists as to how to best position the offender to encourage him to make admissions against his interest. 
     
      
    78 I find the task of deciding whether or not the offender was speaking from a genuinely held belief as to his capacity, ability and willingness to kill people for money or whether he was simply endeavouring to match the expectations of others either out of vanity or out of some perceived sense of failure or inferiority, an immensely difficult one. Consistently with authority, however, I do not have to be satisfied of this matter beyond reasonable doubt (see R v SLD [2003] NSWCCA 310; 58 NSWLR 589). While I do not displace altogether the fact that this offender might pose a risk to the community by reason of him being apt to be persuaded to kill again, I am not satisfied that an assessment of that risk reaches that degree of potentiality that the protection of the community requires a life sentence. I am of the view that in circumstances where the Crown has not tendered any evidence that would enable me to assess the risk objectively (by, for example, a suitably trained professional being asked to view all the evidence inclusive of the offender’s conversations with the undercover police and offer an opinion, if possible, as to his psychological profile) I have already noted that Dr Hampshire adds nothing by way of any elucidation on the question by reason of the fact that in his report he appears to have been told little, if anything, about the offender’s behaviour in the course of the undercover operation that was mounted some years later. In these circumstances, any assessment by me as to future dangerousness would be speculative. I should add that it is not without some disquiet that I have come to that conclusion. However, having regard to the Crown’s obligation to satisfy me that the community would be at risk were this man to be given anything other than a life sentence, and in circumstances where there is no expert evidence that compels that conclusion or indeed even informs that conclusion, I am unable to form a positive view that the risk is both real and measurable. 
     
      
       
      Retribution and deterrence 
       
      
    79 The community at large is however entitled to look to this Court for the imposition of a sentence which meets its legitimate desire for retribution when two of its community members have been senselessly and heartlessly killed as they approached the end of a productive and honest working life. It hardly needs emphasis from me that the community is entitled to have the sentence imposed on this offender produce the effect, if only in the abstract, of deterring others from taking life for the promise of financial reward. 
     
      
       
      Rehabilitation 
       
      
    80 In this case there is no evidence at all of this offender’s attitude to his offending or his prospects of rehabilitation. For this reason, rehabilitation is not a matter I can take into account in his favour in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    81 In all the circumstances, having regard to the findings I have made as to the high degree of criminality involved in the offences for which the offender stands to be sentenced, offending which is very close to the worst case category of offences where a double murder was premeditated and motivated by greed, and having regard to the other criteria provided for in s 61(1) of the Act to which I have referred, I am satisfied that life sentences are required. I am further satisfied that there is no adequate basis, in the exercise of discretion, for any lesser sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    82 Accordingly, on the two charges of murder, I sentence Terry Mark Donai to concurrent sentences of imprisonment for life, each to date from 16 June 2006.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: I will ask Justice James to give the first judgment.2 JAMES J: Daniel John Hutton applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on him in the District Court on 15 February 2007 by his Honour Solomon DCJ for an offence, to which the applicant had pleaded guilty, of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely, methylenedioxy methylamphetamine (MDMA, commonly known as ecstacy).3 The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of imprisonment for three years commencing 27 May 2006, the date on which he had been arrested and from which he had remained in custody, and a balance of the term of three years.4 Supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug is an offence under s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for twenty years or a fine of 3500 penalty units, or both. There is a standard non-parole period for the offence of ten years. Under Sch 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act the commercial quantity for MDMA is 125 g and the large commercial quantity is 500 g.5 In the proceedings for the sentencing of the applicant there was an agreed statement of facts, which the sentencing judge briefly summarised in his remarks on sentence. The following statement of the facts of the offence is derived from the summary in his Honour's remarks, supplemented to some extent by the agreed statement of facts.6 A police strike force was established to investigate the drug supplying activities of a man named Patterson. Patterson and the applicant were residents of Queensland. In Queensland Patterson approached the applicant, to whom he had been supplying drugs for the applicant's own use. 7 Patterson asked the applicant to take money to Sydney to pay for a quantity of drugs which Patterson had ordered and to bring back to Queensland the drugs which had been ordered. Solomon DCJ found as a fact that the applicant was to receive for his services $500 worth of amphetamine tablets. At the time of committing the offence the applicant was addicted to amphetamine. 8 On 26 May 2006 the applicant flew from Brisbane to Sydney, taking with him nearly $60,000 in cash. He was directed by a person he met in Sydney to a hotel in Randwick, where he booked into a room. The applicant was visited in the hotel room by Patterson's supplier, to whom the applicant handed over the cash. Later that night a total of about 2000 tablets of MDMA, having a total weight of 478 g, were delivered to the applicant's room in the hotel.9 The applicant strapped packages containing the tablets to his legs, using Glad wrap. While strapping the packages to his legs, the applicant reported by telephone to Patterson, using code words to refer to the drugs. The applicant travelled to the airport in the early morning of 27 May 2006, with the intention of flying back to Queensland. He was arrested at the airport.10 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge found that the applicant's role in the drug transaction had been that of a ""bald courier"". His Honour found that the applicant’s offence was at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness for offences under s 25(2).11 His Honour would appear to have made this finding on the basis that at the time of committing the offence the applicant was addicted to drugs and had succumbed to the temptation to obtain drugs by committing the offence. The sentencing judge was clearly aware that the quantity of drugs was only just below the upper limit for the commercial quantity for MDMA of 500 g.12 His Honour made a finding that the applicant had been part of a planned, well-organised operation to transport a large quantity of drugs from New South Wales into Queensland and that the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity” was present.13 At the time of committing the offence the applicant was a mature man, 44 years old. He had been married twice and had several children, one of whom gave evidence on his behalf in the proceedings on sentence. The sentencing judge accepted evidence by this witness that, until the breakdown of his second marriage, the applicant had lived an exemplary life and had not been involved in drugs.14 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge referred to a number of other subjective features of the applicant. The applicant had a criminal history but the sentencing judge regarded that criminal history as being of ""small moment"" and noted that the applicant had not previously been in full-time custody. A submission was made to us at the hearing by counsel for the Crown that the finding that the applicant’s criminal history was of small moment was unduly generous to the applicant but the finding could not be challenged as being insupportable.15 While in custody awaiting sentence the applicant had undertaken counselling for his drug addiction. His Honour, having considered a report from a psychologist and having heard the applicant give evidence in the proceedings on sentence, made a finding that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend.16 His Honour found that the applicant's plea of guilty had been made at the earliest opportunity and that the applicant was genuinely contrite, and his Honour allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the applicant's plea of guilty. His Honour found special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the need of the applicant for ongoing rehabilitation in the community and the fact that the applicant had never previously been in full-time custody. 17 In the proceedings on sentence the sentencing judge had been referred by the applicant's legal representative to the decision of this court in R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135. In that case a Crown appeal against a sentence for supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, being methylamphetamine, was allowed and the respondent was re-sentenced by the Court of Criminal Appeal to a total term of imprisonment of six years, with a non-parole period of three years.18 In the proceedings on sentence it was submitted by the applicant's legal representative that a sentence similar to, or less than, that imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Shi would be an appropriate sentence to pass on the applicant. In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge stated that, in his opinion, the sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Shi was the sentence he should impose on the applicant, and his Honour proceeded to impose the same sentence as had been imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Shi.19 There are two grounds of appeal against sentence:1. The sentencing judge erred in taking into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity.2. The sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to factors subjective to the applicant's case, and placed too much weight on the objective seriousness of the offence and considerations of personal and general deterrence.  
     
      
      GROUND 1 
      
    20 It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that planning is an inherent characteristic of an offence of supplying drugs, and especially a commercial quantity of drugs, and can only be taken into account as an aggravating factor when the amount of the planning exceeds what would normally be expected. Counsel referred to R v Yildiz (2006) 160 A Crim R 218. It was then submitted that in the present case the amount of planning had not exceeded what would normally be expected in an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug.  
     
      
    21 The general submission made by counsel for the applicant is clearly correct and was not disputed by counsel for the Crown. However, it was submitted by counsel for the Crown that in the present case the amount of planning had exceeded what would normally be expected.22 In my opinion, in the present case, unlike in Yildiz, there was evidence on which it was at least open to the sentencing judge to make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the degree of planning exceeded what would normally be expected for an offence of this kind. 23 The evidence of planning would include evidence of the interstate flight by the applicant from Brisbane to Sydney, the meeting with the applicant when he arrived in Sydney, the booking of the applicant into a hotel room in Sydney, the applicant's contacts while in Sydney with Patterson and other co-offenders, and the applicant’s coded telephone conversations with Patterson and other persons, in which terms were used which were clearly coded expressions for drugs and drug-related matters. The evidence would also include evidence of the steps taken by the applicant to conceal the drugs by strapping them to his legs.24 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
      GROUND 2 
      
    25 It was submitted that, if the sentencing judge had allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the applicant's plea of guilty, as the sentencing judge said he had, the sentencing judge must have adopted a starting point, before allowing the discount, of eight years, and such a starting point would have been manifestly excessive.26 Counsel for the applicant pointed to the sentencing judge's finding that the applicant had been a “bald courier” and the finding that on the scale of objective seriousness the applicant's offence was at the lower end of the scale, even though the quantity of drugs was close to the upper limit of the range for a commercial quantity of MDMA.  
     
      
    27 As I have already indicated, the sentencing judge had been referred by counsel for the applicant in the proceedings on sentence to the decision of this court in Shi. I observe that it is seldom appropriate to sentence an offender by having regard merely to a single other sentence for another offender who was not a co-offender.  
     
      
    28 Shi was similar to the present case in that the offender had been sentenced for one offence of supplying not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. In that case the drug supplied was methyl amphetamine, for which a higher large commercial quantity is set, and the quantity in question was just below the upper limit of the range for a commercial quantity.29 However, an important feature of Shi was that it was a Crown appeal against sentence. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the sentencing judge had made a number of specific errors in applying the standard non-parole period provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. In re-sentencing Shi the then Chief Judge at Common Law said that the sentence being imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal of a head sentence of six years with a non-parole period of three years was the least sentence that could properly have been imposed at first instance.30 Shi’s subjective circumstances were very substantially different from those of the present applicant. Shi was only 18 years old at the time of committing the offence and the Court of Criminal Appeal found he had been vulnerable, because of his age and background (he had migrated to Australia from China at the age of 14 years) and his drug addiction and he had been used, and preyed upon, by older men because of his vulnerability.31 We were referred by counsel for the applicant to sentencing statistics for sentences imposed for supplying a commercial quantity of the drug ecstasy. However, these statistics are of limited assistance because there are very few cases, and those cases, of course, include offences within the wide range for a commercial quantity of ecstasy, that is from 125 g to 500 g.  
     
      
    32 Although counsel for the applicant disavowed making a submission that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, it seems to me that the second ground of appeal is tantamount to a ground of appeal that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 33 I have already summarised the objective facts and the subjective circumstances of the present applicant and I have noted the maximum penalty for the offence and the standard non-parole period for the offence.34 I am unable to conclude that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge exceeded the upper limit of a proper exercise of the sentencing judge’s sentencing discretion, and I would reject the second ground of appeal.35 I would grant leave to appeal, but having rejected both grounds of appeal, I would dismiss the appeal.36 CAMPBELL JA: I agree. I would add only that the second ground of appeal as formulated does not strike me as a valid ground of appeal against the sentence. It does not allege that there was an error of law involved, in the way in which the sentencing judge gave weight to factors subjective to the applicant's case, or to the objective seriousness of the offence and considerations of personal and general deterrence. Neither does it in terms assert that the sentence arrived at was manifestly excessive – ie an exercise of discretion outside the range within which a reasonable judge, applying proper principles, could fix a sentence. I agree with James J having considered it as though it raised a contention that the sentence was manifestly excessive.37 I agree with the orders proposed by James J.38 JOHNSON J: I also agree with the reasons and orders proposed by James J.39 CAMPBELL JA: The orders of the court will therefore be as proposed by James J.

      JUDGMENT - Application to exclude evidence under s 138 of Evidence Act (Identification of Moustafa Cheikho) 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application made on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. The section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          138(1) evidence that was obtained:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.” 
        
       
      
    2 Sub-section (3), without limiting the matters that the Court may take into account, sets out those that must be taken into account. This exercise becomes necessary only if the Court is satisfied that the evidence was obtained improperly, in contravention of an Australian law, or in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law. The section requires a balancing exercise taking into account, amongst other things, those matters mentioned in sub-section (3).  
     
      
    3 The accused has the onus of proving the matters that would raise the exercise of the discretion (R v Coombe (NSWCCA, Hunt CJ, Smart and McInerney JJ, 24 April 1997 - unreported BC9701438.) 
     
      
    4 Where the accused has established an impropriety or illegality, the onus is placed on the Crown to persuade the trial Judge that the evidence should nevertheless be admitted: R v Coulstock (1998) 99 A Crim R 143.  
     
      
    5 The meaning of the term ""an impropriety"" was considered in Robinson v Woolworths Limited (2005) 64 NSWLR 612.  
     
      
    6 In that case it was held that the identification of impropriety requires attention to the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “First, it is necessary to identify what, in a particular context, may be viewed as 'the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement'. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the conduct in question must not merely blur or contravene these standards in some minor respect; it must be 'quite inconsistent with' or 'clearly inconsistent with' those standards. (A third category was mentioned which is not relevant to the present matter.)” 
        
       
      
    7 See also Director of Public Prosecutions v AM (2006) 161 A Crim R 219; R v Cornwell (2003) 57 NSWLR 82 and R v Petroulias (No 8) (2007) NSWSC 82; R v Petroulias (No 9) (2007) NSWSC 84. 
     
      
       
      Previous decision 
       
      
    8 On 15 April 2008 I gave a decision which related, inter alia, to an application on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho to exclude a body of evidence pursuant to the exercise required by s 137 of the Evidence Act (R v Baladjam & Ors (No 7), unreported, 15 April 2008).  
     
      
    9 The body of evidence which was the subject of that decision is, in fact, precisely the same evidence that is now the subject of the present application under s 138. Such an application was foreshadowed at the time, but it was agreed between the Crown and Moustafa Cheikho's legal representatives that the s 138 question might be deferred until a later time. The delay was occasioned, in part, by the need for the defence to have access to certain subpoenaed material and further disclosure material.  
     
      
    10 There is no need for me to repeat in this decision the detail of the impugned body of evidence. It is set out fully in the decision of 15 April 2008. Essentially, it is evidence that a man named Yong Ki Kwon, who had attended a LeT camp in Pakistan, identified the accused Moustafa Cheikho as one of the trainees at that camp. At the time, the man identified by Kwon was known as Abu Asad. According to Kwon's evidence, Abu Asad was at the training camp with him in late 2001.  
     
      
    11 The earlier decision identifies the general relevance of Kwon's evidence in relation to the present trial. It also addresses the s 137 issue. Each of the issues was determined unfavourably to the interests of the accused. 
     
      
       
       
      The present application under section 138 
       
      
    12 Mr Button SC made written and oral submissions on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho. Those submissions accepted that a number of statutory protections against the admission of identification evidence did not apply to the present matter. For example, it was accepted that section 3ZO of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) did not apply. Secondly, it was accepted that ss 114 and 115 of the New South Wales Evidence Act had no application to the present matter.  
     
      
    13 Mr Button's submissions focused upon the procedure which had been adopted to obtain the evidence from Kwon that he was able to recognise the man Abu Asad as a person he had trained with at the LeT camp in late 2001. The basic proposition embraced by Mr Button was that the process was a flawed one for a number of reasons. A principal one was that it did not involve the preparation of a proper photo board containing individuals of a similar description to the accused, and no other steps were taken to otherwise ensure the fairness of the identification process undertaken with Kwon. It was not suggested that it would have been practical or possible to hold an identification parade. 
     
      
    14 The particular process is described briefly at paragraph 14 of the decision of 15 April 2008. The man Springer who conducted the interview was an ASIO agent. He has, at all times, maintained that the process was one of intelligence gathering and not one of investigation for the purpose of gathering evidence for prosecution or trial in relation to an offence. It is against the background of these matters that Mr Button's submissions have been made. They may be briefly stated as follows:  
     
      
    15 First, Senior Counsel argues that the process involved was, in truth, part of an ongoing investigation into suspected criminal activity in Australia. It was not in fact, an intelligence gathering process. The manner in which the identification occurred constituted a reckless impropriety and, as such, should lead the Court to find that the evidence is inadmissible.  
     
      
    16 Secondly, in the alternative, Mr Button SC argued that, if the photo identification is considered to be part of an intelligence gathering process, it is improper that it be received as evidence. This is so because the process of gathering the evidence destroyed the efficacy of a ""correct"" evidence gathering process. (This was a reference to the fact that the Australian Federal Police on 16 December 2003 carried out a full photo board identification process with Kwon in which, for the second time, Kwon identified a photo of Moustafa Cheikho as the man Abu Asad.) The point Mr Button made was that the prosecution has disavowed a tender of the AFP identification process but wish to rely upon the first process conducted by Mr Springer. Senior Counsel argued that the prosecution should not be allowed to do this. 
     
      
    17 Mr Button's final submission was that, if the evidence, as he submitted, is “inadmissible” pursuant to s 138, the balancing process mandated by section 138(3) should result in a finding that the desirability of admitting the evidence is outweighed by the undesirability of the evidence being admitted. Accordingly, the evidence should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Was the process an ""intelligence gathering process""?  
       
      
    18 In my view, the answer to this question must be in favour of the prosecution. The starting point is the evidence of Mr Springer. He gave evidence at a previous trial (R v Lodhi) both on the voir dire and at trial. The evidence in that trial related to the processes of identification that occurred on 26 November 2003 with the witness Kwon. In the Lodhi trial, the point at issue, however, related to the identification by Kwon of a man he had trained with in Pakistan. This man was ultimately shown to be a French terrorist, one Willie Brigitte. It was, however, during the same series of interviews that the identification of Moustafa Cheikho as Abu Asad occurred. This second identification was not relevant for any purpose in the Lodhi trial. Nevertheless, the evidence given by Springer in that trial is plainly relevant to the present issue. There is no dispute about that in the present application, although, as will be seen, Mr Button has argued that Springer’s evidence, in the light of other material, should not be given undue prominence. Springer also gave evidence at the committal of the present accused in this trial. 
     
      
    19 There is no need for me to set out in detail the evidence given by Springer. He said on a number of occasions during the Lodhi trial that he had conducted his interviews on 26 November 2003 for intelligence gathering purposes. He said he was not aware of the procedure that the AFP used for identification of suspects from photographs. He said that the reason he took additional photographs with him was because he wanted to leave the interview with accurate intelligence about the information. Springer conceded that it was his assumption that the police would be interested in any information. It was his intention, as was his usual practice, to share any information with the AFP. He agreed that people in the photographs were either people of interest or people known to ASIO. The purpose of the procedure was for ASIO to determine if Kwon could recognise any of the people in the photographs. This process was designed to assist ASIO to determine if the person was, was not, or might be, involved in terrorist activity.  
     
      
    20 Springer later said that he could not recall what, if anything, he was told about Moustafa Cheikho prior to the interview. He said that he knew ""very little about him"" prior to that. (This last statement came from Springer at committal in relation to the present trial.) This evidence, in general terms, provides a solid basis for a finding that the process was one of intelligence gathering. 
     
      
    21 Secondly, I do not accept the submission that ASIO and the AFP were working ""hand in glove"" in relation to either the Kwon interviews. I do not accept that there was a joint criminal investigation in respect of which the Kwon identification, when it occurred, played a significant part. Importantly, there is no evidence that the AFP knew at all that these interviews were being undertaken by Springer on 26 November 2003. The evidence is rather to the contrary.  
     
      
    22 Thirdly, I do not accept that there was an ongoing “police-type” operation that ASIO and AFP were part of involving the investigation of associates of Brigitte and Lodhi, including the present accused Moustafa Cheikho. Certainly, there was a joint operation. In my view, the role of ASIO was essentially intended to be one of gathering intelligence, and the role of the AFP was one of essentially investigating the commission of terrorist crimes in Australia. In any event, the AFP played no part in the identification process on 26 November 2003 and that process was, as I have said, essentially one of gathering intelligence.  
     
      
    23 In a second ""confidential"" judgment to be published on a restricted basis today, I examine in considerable detail the documentary and other material relied upon by Mr Button to advance the proposition that there was a joint “investigation” process involving the two agencies in operation at the time of the 26 November 2003 interview between Springer and Kwon. I have carefully examined all of that material but I have concluded that Mr Button's principal submission cannot be accepted. The “confidential” judgment should be read in conjunction with the present decision 
     
      
    24 In general terms, it seems to me that ASIO were attempting to confine their activities to intelligence gathering. That is certainly the way that ASIO operatives saw their task and any examination of the confidential material does not dictate a contrary conclusion. It seems to me that, in general terms, ASIO were jealously guarding their role as intelligence gatherers. While they might, on occasions, have strayed from this path into aspects of the investigative process, (for example, in the Lodhi trial in relation to activities n Australia), I do not think that happened in relation to the Kwon identification.  
     
      
    25 In the same way, it may be said that the AFP conscientiously investigates the activities of persons suspected of being involved in the commission of crime in Australia. Where information is properly placed before it by ASIO, the AFP regard it as its duty to utilise that information to investigate whether a crime has been committed and whether consideration should be given to the arrest and charging of persons whose activities may reveal criminal offences. It is noteworthy that no charges were ever laid again Moustafa Cheikho in relation to his activities in Pakistan in 2001. The present offence, by way of contrast, relates to activities in New South Wales occurring from mid-2004 onwards. 
     
      
       
      Does the Kwon identification reveal an impropriety in the manner in which ASIO conducted the photo identification process?  
       
      
    26 The simple answer to this question is that s 138 is not engaged at all for the reasons I have already indicated. In any event, I am not persuaded that what happened on 26 November 2003 can be said to be ""improper"" in a more general sense. In the process of gathering intelligence, there was no obligation on the part of ASIO to adopt the procedures required to be utilised by police officers when attempting to obtain identification evidence in relation to a person having committed a crime.  
     
      
    27 In the first place, although Mr Springer and his agency would have been not unaware of the criminal nature generally of terrorist activities, the real purpose of the interview with Kwon was to obtain information from him as to the identity of persons who had trained with him at the LeT camp. In addition, intelligence was sought to be gathered as to the nature of the training at that camp.  
     
      
    28 Secondly, as I have mentioned, the identification of Moustafa Cheikho as Abu Asad did not involve the identification of the accused as a person committing the crime with which he is charged in the present indictment. That, of course, is not an end to the matter, but it is a distinction that may be brought to bear on the issue. The fact of Moustafa Cheikho's training at the LeT camp, if the identification be accepted, is but one piece of circumstantial evidence in the Crown case alleging the existence of an agreement involving the accused and others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. That agreement is said, on the Crown case, to have come into existence about mid 2004 and to have continued until the arrest of the accused in November 2005. The fact of Moustafa Cheikho's training in Pakistan in 2001 is but part of the Crown circumstantial case although, in accordance with the decision I gave on 15 April 2008, it is not to be admitted against the other men accused of the conspiracy.  
     
      
    29 I do not consider that the fact that the material was obtained during an intelligence gathering purpose should lead to its being rejected on the basis that, as it turns out, the material is now to be tendered as evidence in a criminal trial. No authority was cited to me to justify such an approach and I reject it.  
     
      
    30 Mr Button argued, as I pointed out earlier, that Springer ought to have consulted the AFP before he conducted the interview so as to enable ASIO to comply with police procedures. But this argument assumes that the AFP and ASIO were jointly engaged in investigation of a criminal activity. This was not the case. The very fact that Springer did not consult the AFP is cogent proof of the fact that no such arrangement existed between the two agencies. I agree with the Crown that the fact that this evidence is now to be tendered in proof of an offence committed many months after the interview with Kwon does not transform or alter the character of the process undertaken by Springer on behalf of ASIO. In addition, as I discuss in the “confidential” judgment, the ASIO selection of photos to be shown reinforces that the interview was one for intelligence gathering purposes, not for criminal investigation purposes. 
     
      
    31 I also agree that section 3ZO of the Crimes Act had no application to this interview. Not only was Springer not a constable, but it is clear that it was not his function to identify a ""suspect"" within the meaning of the sections in the Commonwealth Crimes Act. Of course, Mr Button did not submit that section 3ZO had any direct application. But it was at least implied in the written submissions that, by analogy, a failure to comply with those types of stipulations (reliance being placed on matters discussed in R v Alexander (1991) 45 CLR 395) might result in Springer's conduct being regarded as improper and recklessly so.  
     
      
    32 The Crown argued, in any event, that the principles in Alexander's case had little application to the present matter. The issue in that case was the identification of a person not previously known to the witness where an offender had been seen by the witness in connection with the commission of a crime. By way of contrast, the Crown argued here that this was not a case of identification. It was rather a case of recognition of a person known to Kwon. The recognition was provided to Springer in his capacity as a gatherer of intelligence for ASIO, and did not relate to the commission of a crime, certainly not the crime with which Moustafa Cheikho is presently charged.  
     
      
    33 I do not accept that the tender of the subject body of evidence is or will be inadmissible in the present trial. In my opinion, provided appropriate directions are given that reflect the usual dangers of identification evidence generally and the particular problems that might be said to exist in the present matter, the evidence is admissible. The Alexander principles still have application, not to exclude the evidence but to give content to the directions that may be necessary. 
     
      
    34 It is not necessary for me to label conclusively at this stage whether the evidence be identification evidence or recognition evidence. I am inclined to the view that it was a recognition, albeit one made against the background of a comparatively short period of association. In either case, it will be necessary to give appropriate directions to the jury, although there is no need to identify the precise scope of those directions at this stage. 
     
      
    35 The final matter argued by Mr Button related to his assertion that it would be, in a general sense, improper to allow the Crown to tender the evidence at trial in circumstances where the Crown had determined not to tender evidence of 16 December 2003 AFP photo board identification process. Senior Counsel’s argument appeared to be this: it was argued that the process by which Mr Springer obtained evidence that identified Moustafa Cheikho as the man Kwon had trained with in the LeT camp “tainted” or “infected” the later AFP procedure. In other words, when the AFP showed a proper picture board to Kwon, the displacement effect would have been so great (in the light of his earlier identification) that the picture board process would have had no or little probative value.  
     
      
    36 Mr Button suggested that there was something improper about the Crown endeavouring to produce evidence of the Springer/Kwon identification in circumstances where it could no longer rely upon the tainted AFP procedure. The Crown did not accept that the AFP procedure was “tainted” in any real sense. It accepted, no doubt, that the forensic value of the AFP process might be lessened by the sequence of events which had occurred. But, in any event, the Crown said it was perfectly proper to lead evidence of the Kwon/Springer identification because that was the first time the identification occurred. The fact that the evidence was obtained during an intelligence gathering process had no bearing on the decision to lead that evidence in relation to the commission of a later offence. 
     
      
    37 It seems clear to me that, in one sense, the Crown has made a tactical forensic decision. It has decided to go with the Kwon-Springer identification with all of the faults that process might exhibit. Of course, the Crown does not say that the process was particularly flawed. It accepts, however, that directions will have to be given pointing out that the selection of photos was not an ideal one. On the other hand, the Crown will no doubt argue before the jury that there are reasons why the jury might, despite warnings and directions, ultimately accept the identification as reliable. From the point of view of forensic tactics, the later identification, involving the AFP officers, does pose greater problems for the Crown. I accept that is so. I fail to see, however, that there is anything improper in relation to the decision made by the Crown to lead evidence of the first identification. Once again, provided appropriate directions are given, in my view the evidence should not be rejected for any of the reasons advanced by Mr Button. 
     
      
    38 For these reasons, I am perfectly satisfied that s 138 has not been triggered by the presence of an impropriety, a contravention of an Australian law or that the evidence was obtained in consequence of an impropriety. Moreover, I am not satisfied that, for any other reasons, it would be improper to admit the evidence. 
     
      
    39 Lest I be wrong about those matters, I turn to sub-section (3). In my view, the evidence sought to be adduced has a reasonably high probative value. That was the decision I reached in the decision given on 15 April 2008 (at para 69) and I see no reason to modify that view. Issues such as any alleged weakness in the photographic identification process itself and weakness attaching to the reliability of the evidence of Kwon may appropriately be the subject of directions.  
     
      
    40 Secondly, the evidence is plainly of importance in the proceedings. It goes directly to facts in issue and to rebut the likely defence case.  
     
      
    41 Thirdly, the offence is a serious one.  
     
      
    42 Fourthly, while I have found that there was no impropriety, any impropriety, if one existed, is of a minor kind. Mr Springer had no knowledge of proper police procedures and, in view of the fact that he was, in his mind, simply gathering intelligence, there was no need for him to have had such knowledge. Similarly, there was no need for him to consult the AFP on the subject, since he was not at that time jointly engaged in any investigative process with the AFP. If I am wrong, and there be thought to be some impropriety in what happened, I do not consider that it was either deliberate or for that matter reckless. It may, at worst, have been naïve or careless. 
     
      
    43 Finally, I have considered the matters in sub-section (3)(f), (g) and (h). I do not consider that any of those matters are such as to require me to find that the evidence should not be admitted. On any view of it, I consider that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of so doing.  
     
      
       
      I reject the application made under s 138 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       to exclude the evidence.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 SIMPSON J: Pursuant to s 56(1)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (“the Appeal and Review Act”), the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (“the DPP”) appeals against orders made on 24 September 2007 by a magistrate in the Local Court dismissing a single charge (of causing malicious damage to property) against each of the defendants. 
     
      
    2 S 56(1) permits an appeal to be to be brought solely on a ground that involves a question of law alone. There was no dispute in the present case that the appeals do involve such a ground, but the limitation is significant for another reason, which will appear below; nor, indeed, was there any dispute that the appeals ought, in relation to the grounds raised by the DPP, succeed. However, each defendant has filed a Notice of Contention, (subsequently amended) asserting that the order made ought to be affirmed on other grounds, and each appeal dismissed. 
     
      
    3 The case raises interesting, and, perhaps, novel questions. 
     
      
       
      Background 
      
    4 On 24 September 2007 each defendant appeared in the Local Court at Newcastle charged with an offence against s 195(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, of maliciously damaging property. The background facts were not in dispute. Each defendant is what might be called an environmental activist associated with the movement well known as “Greenpeace”. On 21 February 2007, with others, they scaled a mesh fence and entered the site of a coal loader in or near Newcastle operated by a corporation called Port Waratah Coal Services (“Port Waratah”). They activated a safety isolation switch on a conveyor belt, rendering the conveyor inoperable. They then chained themselves to the underside of the conveyor belt, using heavy metal chain and steel clamps. As a consequence, the conveyor was out of operation for almost 2 hours, at a cost to the proprietor of approximately $27,000. 
     
      
    5 Police attended and asked the defendants to produce a key to unlock the devices, which they declined to do, saying that they did not have the key and did not know where it was. The police used their own equipment to release the defendants. They were arrested and charged under s 195(1) with maliciously damaging property. That was an offence created by s 195 of the Crimes Act, which relevantly then provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        195. Maliciously destroying or damaging property 
        
       
       
        
        (1) a person who maliciously destroys or damages property belonging to another or to that person and another is liable: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) to imprisonment for 5 years, …” 
        
       
       
      (The section has since been amended, in a way that does not impact upon the present proceedings.) 
       
      
    6 Some light is cast on the meaning of the word “damages” by s 194(4), which provides, for the purposes of that Division of the Crimes Act in which both sections appear, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        194. Interpretation 
        
       
       
        
        (4) For the purposes of this Division, damaging property includes removing, obliterating, defacing or altering the unique identifier of the property. The unique identifier is any number, letter or symbols that are marked or attached to the property as a permanent record so as to enable the property to be distinguished from similar property.” 
        
       
      
    The Crimes Act contains no other definition of “damages” or “damaging”. 
     
      
    7 Each defendant was also charged with an offence of trespass and entered a plea of guilty to that charge. Each pleaded not guilty to the s 195 charge. 
     
      
    8 On the hearing, no oral evidence was given. The DPP put before the magistrate an agreed statement of facts, and statements made by two police officers and two employees, in managerial positions of Port Waratah. Also in evidence was a letter on Greenpeace letterhead dated 21 February 2007, addressed to “Port Waratah Coal Services Limited” and copied to the Waratah Police Station, and photographs of the events. The letter set out in detail what the activists, including the defendants, had done. It said that “locking devices” had been placed around one roller of each of four conveyors, and warned against restarting or moving the conveyors before the locking devices had been removed (because the defendants were chained to one of the conveyors).  
     
      
    9 At the commencement of the hearing, counsel who appeared for the defendants stated that he wished, briefly, to cross-examine two of the police officer witnesses. He said that there was little dispute about the facts and identified the issue for determination as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… whether or not the actions of the defendants in this case … amount to malicious damage … within the definition of the [Crimes] Act.” 
        
       
      
    10 After some discussion and, as I read the transcript, on the prompting of the magistrate, counsel stated that he was “comfortable” for the matter to be dealt with “on the papers “.  
     
      
    11 The prosecutor then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “while we say that there is no damage as such, physical, sustained to the coal loader itself, the present matters do, irrespective of what’s been, what would be suggested, there is an actual physical interference with the property, where the two accused attached heavy metal chains to the conveyor belt, making it temporarily inoperable.” 
        
       
      
    12 The prosecutor and counsel for the defendants then made submissions, generally concerning the meaning of “damages”, as the word appeared in s 195, and whether the evidence of what the defendants did to the conveyor belt did (in fact) constitute damage within the meaning of that section. (No separate argument was addressed to whether the evidence was capable of supporting a finding of guilt on that basis.) 
     
      
    13 The magistrate gave judgment. The transcript records the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “The police rely on a phrase, the various cases of which have been tendered, ‘temporary functional derangement of property’.  
        
       
       
        
        However, when one looks at this objectively the police prosecutor is referring to damages, but at law there are always two sorts of damages: there’s physical damage to property and there’s monetary damages which are awarded by way of compensation by courts. In this particular matter the police to my mind have taken it upon themselves to in effect take over the role of the civil courts in seeking to apply a criminal charge to what I think is a civil activity. 
        
       
       
        
        True it is that some people may strongly disapprove of the actions of the defendant (sic) and the delay that they caused, but the bottom line is that if the Port Waratah Coal Loader is saying that they lost 1½ hours of production, the appropriate thing, I would have thought, would be to sue these two people civilly to recover the cost of damages caused by the delay in production. To bring about a criminal charge simply on the basis of perceived mischief and seek to bend the cases and the definition to fit around the factual situation now before the Court, to my mind, is inappropriate.  
        
       
       
        
        There is no doubt that the Port Waratah Coal Loader had a very strong civil case against these two defendants, but in relation to the police charge, it is my view that the appropriate damages are monetary. To try and extend this into the criminal arena is inappropriate and I decline to do so.” 
        
       
       
      He proceeded to dismiss each charge. 
       
      
    14 The DPP contends that this decision is infected by error of law and seeks an order that the proceedings be remitted to the Local Court at Newcastle for hearing and determination according to law. The error of law identified concerns the proper construction and application of s 195(1) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    15 As I have indicated above, it was conceded on behalf of the defendants that a decision was infected by error, although I am not sure that the parties are at one as to the nature of the error. The defendants, as I understand it, concede that the rigid delineation between acts constituting criminal behaviour and conduct justifying an award of damages under the civil law, could not be sustained. In my opinion this concession is properly made. There are many cases in which the civil law and the criminal law overlap, and the same conduct can give rise to criminal liability as well as civil liability. The magistrate seems to have drawn a strict disjunction between the two. 
     
      
    16 I am satisfied that an error of law has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    17 It is therefore necessary to consider the Amended Notices of Contention. 
     
      
    18 Part 51B Rule 18 of the Supreme Court Rules (which continue to apply in respect of proceedings brought under the Appeal and Review Act) permits a Notice of Contention to be filed. The rule provides: 
     
      
       
        
        Notice of Contention 
        
       
       
        
        18 Where a defendant wishes to contend that the decision of the tribunal below should be affirmed on grounds other than those relied upon by the tribunal below but does not seek a discharge or variation of any part of the decision of the tribunal below, the defendant need not file a notice of cross-appeal but, within the time limited by rule 17(2) the defendant must: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) file notice of that contention stating, briefly but specifically, the grounds relied upon in support of contention;…” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19 The defendants’ contention is that the magistrate’s decision to dismiss the charges was correct and should be affirmed because their actions did not “damage” any property. 
     
      
    20 During argument a further question emerged, concerning the extent of matters able to be raised in a Notice of Contention filed under SCR 51B  
     
      
      Rule 18. 
       
      
    21 Senior counsel who appeared for the defendants argued that it was open to this Court to proceed to make any finding of fact that it was open to the magistrate in the Local Court to make. (On that basis, he argued that, on the evidence, I ought to find that, as a matter of fact, that the DPP had, in the Local Court, failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendants had caused any damage to the conveyor.) Counsel who appeared for the DPP contended otherwise: that the appeal is confined to a question of law, and that the capacity to defend the order by the Notice of Contention procedure should be seen as equally so limited. On that basis, I ought only to uphold the Notices of Contention if satisfied that the evidence adduced in the Local Court, as a matter of law, was incapable of supporting a finding (of fact) that the defendants had caused any damage to the conveyor. 
     
      
    22 No authority was cited by either party. This may be because there is none or, more likely, because the question arose during the course of argument. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion, the position adopted on behalf of the DPP is correct. It is quite clear from s 59(1) of the Appeal and Review Act that the intention of the legislature was that first instance decisions would be reviewed by this Court only where a ground of law is involved. The present is not a good case to test the point: that is because all of the evidence was given in documentary form, there was no oral evidence given, and no issues of credit or, indeed, disputed issues of fact, other than the extent of any damage done by the defendants to the property of the coal loader arose. Accordingly, I am in as good a position as the magistrate to make any necessary findings of fact. But that is a rare case: it would not ordinarily be possible for this Court to proceed to make findings of fact upon evidence before the Local Court, where those findings depend upon an assessment of the credibility of witnesses. There is no reason to make an exception in the present case, merely because, as it happened, no oral evidence was given. The extent of the jurisdiction of this Court does not and cannot depend upon the manner in which the evidence is given in the first instance tribunal. 
     
      
    24 I am of the view that, it being correctly conceded that error of law has been demonstrated, the appropriate course is to remit the matter to the Local Court for further hearing according to law, unless it can be shown that, as a matter of law, it would not have been open to that court to make a finding of fact adverse to the defendants on the issue of damage. In that case, practicality and justice would require that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    25 The issue concerns the interpretation of the word “damages” as it appears in s 195. I have already referred to the evidence concerning what the defendants did, and to what was said by the prosecutor in argument to the magistrate. There was no lasting physical damage to any property of Port Waratah. 
     
      
    26 I was referred to a number of cases, both civil and criminal, in which the concept of “damage” (as a noun) or “damage/s/d” (as a verb) has been considered. 
     
      
    27 What, to my mind, emerges from the authorities cited are these propositions: 
     
      
       
      (1) Whether the accused is shown to have damaged the item of property is a question of fact and degree and, therefore, for the tribunal of fact:  
      Henderson v Battley 
        
      (unreported 29 November 1984, English Court of Appeal, Criminal Division), cited in 
        
      Cox v Riley 
        
      (1986) 83 CR. APP.R.54 at 54;  
      Morphitis v Salmon  
      [1990] Crim LR 48. 
       
       
      (Whether there is evidence  
      capable of  
      establishing 
       that the accused damaged the item remains a question of law for the judge); 
       
       
      (2) It is not necessary that the damage be permanent or irreparable:  
      R v Fisher 
       (1865) LR 1 CCR 7;  
      Samuels v Stubbs 
       (1972) 4 SASR 200;  
      R v Zischke 
       [1983] Qd R 240;  
      Hardman v the Chief Constable of Avon & Somerset Constabulary 
       [1986] Crim LR 330;  
      Rowe v Kingerlee 
       [1986] Crim LR 735. 
       
       
      (The last three cases all involved the application of graffiti to walls or a pavement using various substances of varying degrees of solubility and therefore impermanency.) 
       
      
    28 On behalf of the DPP considerable weight was placed upon a phrase that was used in the decision of the South Australian Supreme Court in Samuels v Stubbs. That was a case in which the accused was alleged to have participated in a political demonstration which attracted the attention of the police. A police officer’s cap fell to the ground; the accused was alleged to have kicked it and jumped on it with both feet, causing it to be crushed. The cap was removed by somebody else and was not available in evidence. The magistrate dismissed the charge, holding that it had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt that actual damage was done to the cap. On appeal, Walters J held to the contrary and entered a conviction. In doing so, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The word ‘damage’ in law has more than one meaning and care has to be exercised in examining the context in which the word appears … It seems to me that it is difficult to lay down any very general and, at the same time, precise and absolute rule as to what constitutes ‘damage’. One must be guided in a great degree by the circumstances of each case, the nature of the article and the mode in which it is affected or treated. Moreover, the meaning of the word ‘damage’ must, as I have already said, be controlled by its context. The word may be used in the sense of ‘mischief done to property’ as distinct ‘from injury done to the person’, so that the term ‘damage’ may not necessarily ‘be employed interchangeably with the term ‘injury’ with reference to mischief wrongfully occasioned to the person’ … It is my view, however, the word ‘damages’, as it is used in [in the relevant legislation], is sufficiently wide in its meaning to embrace injury, mischief or harm done to property, and that in order to constitute ‘damage’ it is unnecessary to establish such definite or actual damage as renders the property useless, or prevents it from serving its normal function – in this case, prevents the cap from being worn.  
        In my opinion, it is sufficient proof of damage if the evidence proves a temporary functional derangement of the particular article of property 
        . 
          
        I think that an offence is committed against the section if there be wilful and unauthorised injury, mischief or harm to property, even though no loss to the owner of the property ensues; that a distinction may be drawn between damage to property and the consequent loss or damage to the owner of it …” (internal references omitted; emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    29 I will come back to a consideration of the emphasised passage. Before doing so, I will deal, briefly, with some of the other authorities to which reference was made. These are essentially by way of illustration of what has, in the past, been found to constitute damage. In Fisher the accused plugged a feed-pipe to a steam engine and displaced part of the engine so as to render it temporarily inoperable and even dangerous. Nevertheless, the engine was easily restored to its previous condition. It was held that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… great injury may be done to a machine by the displacement of its parts; and in this case, until the parts were replaced the machine was useless. Surely the displacement of the parts was a damage … if done with intent to render the machine useless.” 
        
       
      
    30 A not dissimilar case was R v Tacey [1821] Russ and Ry 452; 168 ER 893. The accused dismantled some manufacturing equipment and removed one part of it. The part was essential to the working of the equipment but it was easily able to be replaced, and was, in fact, often removed for the purposes of cleaning and replacement. It was held that the removal of the part damaged the equipment from making it imperfect and operative. The conviction was upheld.  
     
      
    31 In Henderson v Battley the damage alleged was damage to land that constituted a development site. A large quantity of soil, gravel and mud was dumped by the accused on the land. A significant sum had to be spent to remove the rubbish and restore the land to its pre-existing condition. Cantley J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ultimately whether damage was done to this land was a question of fact and degree for the jury. Damage can be of various kinds. In the  
        Concise Oxford Dictionary 
         ‘damage’ is defined as ‘injury impairing value or usefulness’. That is a definition which would fit in very well with doing something to a cleaned building site which at any rate for the time being impairs its usefulness as such. In addition, as it necessitates work and the expenditure of a large sum of money to restore it to its former state, it reduces its present value as a building site …” 
        
       
      
    32 A civil case in which ‘damage’ was considered is Ranicar v Frigmobile Pty Ltd [1983] Tas R 113 In this case it was alleged that damage had been caused to a consignment of frozen scallops by incorrect handling by a carrier resulting in excessive temperatures. 33 Green CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the ordinary meaning, and therefore the meaning which I should  
        prima facie 
         give to the phrase ‘damage to’ when used in relation to goods, is a physical alteration or change, not necessarily permanent or irreparable, which impairs the value of usefulness of the thing said to have been damaged. It follows that not every physical change to goods would amount to damage. What amounts to damage will depend upon the nature of the goods. …  
        
       
       
        
        The question which remains is whether in the circumstances of this case that change in temperature amounted to damage in the scallops. In my view, it plainly did. An alteration in temperature undeniably involves a physical change to a substance and in this case that change had the effect of removing one of the primary qualities which the scallops had – their exportability. As a result, it is plain that their usefulness was impaired and their value reduced. …  
        
       
       
        
        It may be that under some circumstances goods could be said to have been damaged notwithstanding that they have not undergone any physical change. For example, it might be arguable that food which was handled in a way which violated the religious dietary laws of the country to which it was being exported could be regarded as having been damaged. Similarly, it might be that goods which were handled contrary to quarantine regulations so as to prevent their importation into a country could be regarded as having been damaged notwithstanding that the handling had no contamination effect upon them.” 
        
       
      
    34 These passages need to be read in the context of the issues involved in the litigation. The contract of carriage  protected the carrier from liability in respect of “damage” caused by it; an insurance policy covered the owner in respect of “damage” to the scallops. In those circumstances, it is readily understandable that Green CJ took what might be termed a liberal view of what was encompassed by ”damage”; loss of value could easily be seen, as it was, as damage for the purposes of the two contracts. That sits easily in the concepts of the civil law. In a criminal context, it is not so easy or appropriate to take an expansive view of the meaning of the word. 
     
      
    35 The Macquarie Dictionary relevantly defines “damage” as: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Injury or harm that impairs value or usefulness”; 
        
       
       
      The  
      Shorter Oxford Dictionary 
       gives as definitions: 
       
       
        
        “1. Loss or detriment caused by hurt or injury affecting a state, condition or circumstances ( 
        arch.) 
        
       
       
        
        2. Injury, harm (ME). 
        
       
      
    36 To my mind, a common element to all of the authorities (with the possible exception of Henderson v Battley) is some physical change or alteration to the property, even though this may be temporary. I exclude from that the hypothetical exceptions mentioned by Green CJ in Ranicar because, as I have said, his Honour was there contemplating the notion of damage for the purpose of civil litigation, and in the context of two contractual documents, and not operating in the context of criminal legislation. I have no doubt that damage in the civil sense can be caused without physical injury. 
     
      
    37 That is not so where the criminal law is concerned. Even Henderson v Battley could, in a sense, be seen as involving some physical interference with the land. If it is not to be seen in that light, I would decline to follow that decision. 
     
      
    38 In my opinion, an essential element of “damage” for the purpose of s195 is, to use the words (or some of them) of Walters J in Samuels v Stubbs, “physical derangement” (though not necessarily permanent, or even lasting) to the property in question. It is the word “functional” that has given rise to the present argument. But I do not read his Honour’s conclusion as meaning that temporary functional interference, without a physical interference with the property itself, could be sufficient to establish criminal damage. It is of some significance that in that case the evidence was that the policeman’s cap had been jumped upon and crushed. That was ample evidence of physical derangement. In my opinion too much emphasis has been placed upon the word “functional” without it being seen in its complete and proper context. Interference with functionality alone, without “physical derangement” would, in my opinion, be insufficient to establish damage within the meaning of s 195. Interference with functionality could be proved, for example, by proof of the removal of a key to a motor vehicle, or the erection of physical barricades around a vehicle preventing its use. But here, in my opinion, while they might amount to some other offence, such interference would fall short of amounting to (malicious) damage. 
     
      
    39 It is true that a number of the other cases refer, in one way or another, to functionality. For example, in Zischke, one of the graffiti cases, the Court of Criminal Appeal in Queensland said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What emerges from a review of the decisions is that ‘damage’ may be held to have been done even though the injury to the article of property is not permanent but is remediable, if only by the expenditure of money. Probably the formula that most nearly embraces all the attempts at definition is that a thing is damaged if it is rendered imperfect or inoperative: see  
        ‘A’ (a juvenile) v The Queen 
         [1978] Crim LR 689. This would incidentally also serve to accommodate the decision in  
        Samuels v Stubbs 
         … where a conviction of damaging a policeman’s cap was sustained by proof that the respondent had kicked it three times and then jumped on it, thus producing what was described as a ‘temporary functional derangement’ of the article in question.” 
        
       
      
    40 I do not read this passage as excluding the need for the prosecution to prove some physical impact upon the property. In Zischke the accused had painted political material on buildings, footpaths and walls. The passage quoted was predicated upon the fact that the physical integrity of the property had suffered interference.  
     
      
    41 Moreover, “temporary functional derangement” could not be taken to express a definition of “damage”; a simple illustration will make the point. Scratching or denting the duco of a motor vehicle would, undoubtedly, amount to “damage”; but it does not render the motor vehicle inoperable and does not interfere with its functionality. 
     
      
    42 During the course of the hearing of the present proceedings, some debate took place concerning the boundaries of “damage” said to be occasioned to property. It was postulated that for a protestor to sit in front of or on a bulldozer could not amount to damage within s 195. That proposition is correct. In fact, it is not the action of the protestors that affects the operability of the machine; it is the (sensible) decision of the owners not to use it in circumstances where danger could be caused. 
     
      
    43 On behalf of the DPP it was argued that authority establishes that it is not necessary that there be any alteration in the physical nature of the property. Particular reliance was placed in this respect on Handerson v Battley, Rowe v Kingerlee and Ranicar v Frigmobile. I cannot accept that. I have already indicated that if Henderson does support that proposition, I would not follow it, but, in my opinion, the dumping of large quantities of rubble does physically affect, although temporarily, the surface of the land itself. 
     
      
    44 I am satisfied that, for a conviction to be made out under s 195, it is necessary that the prosecution establish, even to a limited degree, some physical interference or alteration to the property in question. 
     
      
    45 That calls for analysis of the evidence of what the defendants did. 
     
      
    46 In the statement of facts, it was said that they: 
     
      
       
        
        “ …activated a safety isolation dead switch on the conveyor belt rendering the belt inoperable …” 
        
       
       
      Mr Wayne Carman, a terminal manager of Port Waratah, said that a rope had been attached to a lanyard and that he was told by Ms Fraser that they had “pulled the stop”. He said that he told the defendants that that was a control circuit that could be over-ridden and that they were putting themselves in serious danger. (He also said that he had taken steps to ensure that the conveyor was fully isolated and could not be unknowingly started.) He said that to re-start the conveyor belt it was necessary that electricians unlock and de-isolate the conveyor, involving the re-setting of electrical equipment. 
       
      
    47 Mr Mark Golding described the appearance of the defendants, chained to the conveyor; and said that a piece of rope had been tied around the conveyor framework, holding the emergency stop lanyard down. He said that there was a significant risk of damage to the conveyor rollers had the conveyor system been re-started while the locks were still in place. (I discount this as being of any relevance to the present determination; I mention it because it was drawn to my attention in address, but, as I remarked at the time, a risk of injury or damage is not sufficient for the purposes of s 195.) 
     
      
    48 Senior Constable Benjamin Coles gave a description of the chain “wrapped around part of the working mechanism” of one of the conveyor belts.  
     
      
    49 I have come to the conclusion that the application of the locking mechanism, even though unauthorised, is not capable of being held to be “damage” to the machinery. The evidence called in the Lower Court is not capable of proving any damage to the machinery. 
     
      
    50 The consequence of that conclusion is that, if I were to remit the matter to the Local Court, the magistrate would be obliged to make the same order as he previously did, for a different reason. There is no point in clogging an already over-burdened legal system with pointless technicalities. 
     
      
    51 The appropriate course is to dismiss the appeals. In each case, that is the order I make.

       REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Michael Ibrahim pleads guilty to the charge that he on 2 January 2006 did unlawfully kill Robin Nassour. This is a crime of manslaughter.  
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment. 3 Sleiman Tajjour and Mouhamed Tajjour have also pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Robin Nassour. The proceedings on sentence concerned each of the prisoners. The prisoners, Sleiman Tajjour and Mouhamed Tajjour are to be sentenced by me at a later date. 4 A statement of facts agreed between the Crown and the prisoner was tendered by consent and marked as exhibit B. The agreed facts are: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On the evening of 31 December 2005 or the early hours of 1 January 2006 the deceased Robin Nassour (born 24 July 1971, aged 34) and his brother George Nassour (date of birth 26 February 1969, aged 36) and two friends attended the UN Nightclub (formerly known as DCM Nightclub) at 33 Oxford Street, Sydney. The co-accused Michael IBRAHIM was at the time working as a spotter at the nightclub. His brother John promoted the nightclub. The accused presently before the Court are brothers. They are also cousins of the co-accused Michael IBRAHIM. On the night in question, Michael IBRAHIM refused entry to the nightclub to the two friends of the NASSOUR brothers. Robin NASSOUR waited downstairs for a short time with the two friends while George Nassour tried to get them into the nightclub. He was unsuccessful and Robin NASSOUR left with their two friends and went elsewhere. George NASSOUR left and returned later to the nightclub without Robin and the two friends. On returning to the nightclub an acquaintance of George NASSOUR named Ali pestered him to get him (Ali) into the club for nothing, saying he had no money. George told him he was unable to do so, but told Ali to pretend his hand had already been stamped. Michael IBRAHIM overheard this and became angry with George NASSOUR, telling him to get upstairs. George only remained for a short time at the nightclub before leaving. He remained outside for a period of time. At one stage, Robin NASSOUR drove past the club and made a rude gesture with his finger in the direction of George, who was outside the club, Michael IBRAHIM thought that gesture was intended for him.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. In the early hours of 2 January 2006, George NASSOUR, Robin NASSOUR and another friend went to McDonalds at Kings Cross. The accused Mohamed (sic) TAJJOUR (date of birth 16 January 1984, aged 22) and the co-accused Sleiman TAJJOUR (date of birth 27 July 1980, aged 25) were across the road and beckoned George NASSOUR across. Mohamed TAJJOUR demanded that he call Robin NASSOUR across the road. He then punched George NASSOUR in the head. This incident is the subject of the offence of assault to be taken into account on the sentence of Mohamed (sic) TAJJOUR. George, his brother and their friend immediately left the area.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. At about 8.20pm on 2 January 2006, George NASSOUR received a phone call from a co-offender Faouzi ABOU –JIBAL (date of birth 10 January 1977, aged 29) asking George and Robin NASSOUR to attend the Meriton Apartments situated at 3 The Promenade, Chiswick, in an attempt to settle the dispute now perceived to exist between the NASSOUR brothers and Michael IBRAHIM (Faouzi ABOU – JIBAL has since died). George and Robin NASSOUR both attended the complex at about 9.20pm on 2 January 2006, picking up ABOU-JIBAL in their car near the entrance to the complex, where ABOU-JIBAL lived and where he was having a party attended by about twenty people including the three co-accused (IBRAHIM and the two TAJJOUR brothers). ABOU-JIBAL took the NASSOUR brothers to the basement car park of the building in a lift. 
        
       
      
    4. As the three men left the lift, Robin NASSOUR led the way  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          followed closely behind by Faouzi ABOU-JIBAL, with George NASSOUR following closely behind him. The three men started walking up the ramp in the car park. As that occurred the co-accused Mouhamed TAJJOUR, Sleiman TAJJOUR and Michael IBRAHIM walked towards the point where the top of the ramp meets a flat area between ramps. George NASSOUR became upset on seeing the three accused and started calling out words to the effect that this was a set up. At around this time, Faouzi ABOU-JIBAL produced a knife that he had previously kept concealed on his person and stabbed George NASSOUR to his upper rear right leg. He then went to stab George NASSOUR a second time, but George NASSOUR managed to pull him away. The knife was described by George NASSOUR as a fancy knife with a silver handle and shiny blade about thirty centimetres in length. A knife matching this description was subsequently recovered from the Bay near the Meriton apartment complex by police divers. Occupants of the units had seen a man throwing something into the water shortly after the events the subject of the present manslaughter charges. A former fiancée of ABOU-JIBAL, by the name of Shayda BASTANI RAD has identified this knife as one she bought him from the internet site Ebay and gave to him on 22nd or 23rd December 2005. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        5. Immediately after he was stabbed, George NASSOUR saw the accused Sleiman TAJJOUR, Mouhamed TAJJOUR and Michael IBRAHIM surrounding Robin NASSOUR, who was still standing up at this point. George NASSOUR then ran away down the ramp, but returned to see all four men around Robin NASSOUR punching and kicking him. Robin NASSOUR was lying on the ground at this stage. During the attack, George NASSOUR believes he saw something silver being held by one of the accused, which was subsequently thrown at him. He believes that object was a knife. However police subsequently recovered the silver casing of a mobile telephone on the stairway in the area where George NASSOUR had been standing. Subsequent expert fingerprint examination located a palm print belonging to the accused Michael IBRAHIM on this phone casing. The deceased was found to have suffered blunt force injuries to his head consistent with being hit with an object such as a mobile telephone during the attack on him. During the attack on the deceased Robin NASSOUR, he was stabbed by Faouzi ABOU – JIBAL in the left thigh. This stab wound damaged the deceased’s left femoral artery and vein causing loss of blood which led to his death anywhere up to fifteen minutes after the injury was inflicted. There is no evidence of precisely when this fatal stab wound was inflicted during the course of the attack. The deceased also suffered a stab wound to his left shoulder, being a slash type injury. It measured approximately 75mm (3 inches) in length. Again, there is no evidence of precisely when and how this wound was inflicted during the attack.  
        
       
      
    6. The deceased suffered other blunt force injuries during the  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          attack upon him. These incuded lacerations to the head and above his left eye. He also suffered abrasions to his forehead, above his right eyebrow, at the tip of his left elbow, on his right arm and bruising to his left wrist and right legs (sic). These abrasions and bruises are consistent with being inflicted by kicks and punches. The blunt force injuries are consistent with being inflicted by a hard object such as a mobile phone or handle of a knife.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        7. The accused stands to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act on the basis of an extended joint criminal enterprise. He was a party to a joint criminal enterprise with Mouhamed TAJJOUR, Sleiman TAJJOUR and Faouzi ABOU–JIBAL to unlawfully assault Robin NASSOUR in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm and was equally culpable in terms of his role in the offence with the other accused presently before the court in respect of the same offence. He first became aware of the knife at, or immediately after, the time ABOU–JIBAL stabbed George NASSOUR. At this time he foresaw the possibility that Faouzi ABOU–JIBAL might use the knife again to stab Robin NASSOUR and to cause him some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm.”  
        
       
      
    5 I make findings of fact in accordance with the agreed facts for the purpose of sentencing the prisoner. 6 Paragraph 7 of the agreed facts discloses that the prisoner stands to be sentenced for the offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act on the basis of an extended joint criminal enterprise with Mouhamed Tajjour, Sleiman Tajjour and Faouzi Abou-Jibal to unlawfully assault Robin Nassour in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm. As it is an agreed fact that each of the prisoners is equally culpable in terms of his role in the offence, I will refer in these remarks on sentence to submissions made as to the objective facts by counsel for the prisoners.  
     
      
    7 Counsel for the prisoners contend that the offence of manslaughter to which their clients have entered pleas of guilty is at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. 8 The prisoners’ offending did not involve an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased or reckless indifference to human life. There is no suggestion that any of the prisoners stabbed the deceased. It was their intention that they and Faouzi Abou-Jibal (Abou-Jibal) would assault Robin Nassour in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm. None of the prisoners was armed with a weapon. However, each of the prisoners had become aware of the knife in Abou-Jibal’s possession at, or immediately after, the time Abou-Jibal stabbed George Nassour to his upper rear right leg and then went to stab him again. The knife was described by George Nassour as having a silver handle and shiny blade about 30 centimetres in length.  
     
      
    9 The prisoners were then aware that Abou-Jibal would participate with them in the assault upon the deceased whilst he was armed with this knife. Furthermore they foresaw the possibility that Abou-Jibal might use the knife again to cause the deceased some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm. They did not desist but with this knowledge each of them participated in a brutal and cowardly attack upon the deceased. This carries with it, in my opinion, a very significant degree of criminality. It is not in these circumstances a mitigating factor as Mr Dunn QC for the prisoner Sleiman Simon Tajjour submits that the prisoners were unarmed and the blow that was struck by Abou-Jibal was to a “non-vital” part of the body of George Nassour. 10 The prisoners surrounded the deceased. They with Abou-Jibal punched and kicked him whilst he lay on the ground. The blunt force injuries, lacerations, abrasions and bruising suffered by the deceased make evident the violence to which he was subjected. As a consequence of being confronted by four attackers, the deceased was in the position that he could not defend himself against being stabbed with a knife. The deceased was stabbed twice by Abou-Jibal. It was the stab wound to the left thigh which damaged the left femoral artery and vein causing loss of blood which led to his death.11 The Crown invites me to find that an aggravating factor was that “the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity”: s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (Crimes (SP) Act). Whilst the prisoners did not plan the use of a knife, the Crown contends that the unlawful and dangerous act was pre-planned involving as it did Abou-Jibal taking the deceased and his brother to a car park area away from witnesses where the prisoners were waiting. Counsel for each of the prisoners submit that the Court ought not be satisfied that this aggravating factor exists in this case. Each contend that the assault upon the deceased was spontaneous.  
     
      
    12 Mr Richter QC for Michael Ibrahim submits in particular that there is no sufficient evidence of the formation of an intent to assault anyone prior to George Nassour kicking up a fuss in a situation in which there was a meeting to resolve a perceived conflict. He says so far as the deceased is concerned “we know that he kept walking up to the ramp whilst George is calling out because the assault takes place at the top of the ramp and Robin is walking up there. Now, as to why or how, perhaps he had Dutch courage; I know not, we know not”. Mr Richter referred to a cocktail of some drugs in the blood of the deceased “that might give some Dutch courage at the time of his death”. (POS 18/1/08 p 54 L1-17). He argues that the proposition that his client was there to receive an apology could not be rejected.  
     
      
    13 There is no evidence that the prisoner Ibrahim was in the car park to receive an apology. It is an agreed fact that Abou-Jibal had asked the Nassour brothers to attend the Meriton Apartments to attempt to settle the dispute perceived to exist between them and Ibrahim. There is no evidence that the deceased continued to walk towards the prisoners after his brother had been stabbed. Furthermore, there is no evidence from which it may be inferred that the deceased did anything to provoke the attack upon him by the prisoners. There is no evidence in the proceedings on sentence that there was a cocktail of drugs in the blood of the deceased nor is there evidence of the affect that drugs might have had upon him. In any event the suggestion that the deceased provoked the attack upon him by the prisoners after his brother was stabbed is plainly implausible.  
     
      
    14 The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the prisoners had agreed with Abou-Jibal that he would bring the Nassour brothers into the basement car park where Robin Nassour would be unlawfully assaulted in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm. The Crown must exclude as a reasonable possibility that the assault by them upon the deceased was spontaneous. The only rational inference to be drawn from the combination of the taking of the Nassour brothers to the basement car park, the three prisoners walking towards the point where the top of the ramp meets a flat area between the two ramps, George Nassour’s upset on seeing the prisoners, the failure by the prisoners to desist after they became aware of the knife, the lack of provocation by the deceased, the immediacy of the prisoners surrounding the deceased after George Nassour had been stabbed and the violent attack with Abou-Jibal upon the deceased which then followed is that it had been previously agreed that Robin Nassour was to be unlawfully assaulted and it was part of the plan to assault him that he was to be brought down into the basement car park. It is not a reasonable possibility that the agreement to unlawfully assault Robin Nassour was spontaneously formed after George Nassour was stabbed by Abou-Jibal.  
     
      
    15 The agreement to assault the deceased in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm was pre-planned. The agreement to continue to participate in the assault upon the deceased although Abou-Jibal was armed with a knife was not. It was spontaneously formed after the prisoners became aware of the knife at, or immediately after, the time Abou-Jibal stabbed George Nassour. At this time they foresaw the possibility that Abou-Jibal might use the knife again to stab the deceased and to cause him some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm. In R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 the importance of making findings under s 21A in accordance with the words of the provision was stressed. Although the assault was pre-planned, I am not satisfied that the offence of manslaughter was part of a planned criminal activity in the sense envisaged in s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (SP) Act. However, the fact that it had been previously agreed that the deceased was to be assaulted in such a way as to cause him physical injury falling short of grievous bodily harm and as part of the plan to assault him he was brought down into the basement car park increases the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    16 I do not agree with the contention that the prisoners’ offending is at the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness. In my opinion, this is an objectively serious offence of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. It is, as I have recounted, an agreed fact that each of the prisoners is equally culpable in the terms of his role in the offence. 17 The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v MacDonald (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). The starting point in the present sentencing exercise as in all offences of manslaughter is that the life of Robin Nassour aged 34 years has been unlawfully taken: R v Blacklidge (unrep, NSWCCA 12 December 1995). 
     
      
    18 Various cases imposing sentences for manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act were cited by counsel during submissions. It is contended by counsel for the prisoners that the closest comparable case is R v Taiseni & Ors [2007] NSWSC 1090. With that contention I disagree. One of the distinguishing features of the present case is, as I have stated at paragraph 9 (supra), that the prisoners participated in the assault upon the deceased in circumstances where they knew that Abou-Jibal was armed with a knife which he might use again to cause the deceased some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm. To participate in a joint act of violence in these circumstances carries with it, as I have said, a very significant degree of criminality.  
     
      
    19 In Regina v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 Hall J analysed sentences which had been more recently imposed for manslaughter. His Honour’s consideration included offences of manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act. Hall J recognised [at 191] there is no obvious trend or range discernible in terms of any particular sub-set of manslaughter offences. However, his Honour’s review and the cases cited by counsel have been of assistance in determining the appropriate sentence. Each case depends on its own facts. 20 I turn to the subjective case of the prisoner. 
     
      
    21 Michael Ibrahim was born in Sydney on 30 April 1978 and was 27 years old at the time of the offence. His subjective circumstances are mainly taken from the history provided to Mr Tim Watson-Munro (exhibit MI 4). The prisoner did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence.  
     
      
    22 He attended Merrylands Primary and High Schools before leaving during year 9. He then worked as a builder’s labourer for about seven months before taking on a job as a mechanic for about six months. The prisoner told the psychologist that at about that time he started drifting with the wrong company and spending a lot of his time playing snooker. This coincided, Mr Watson-Munro states, with the commencement of substance abuse problems involving primarily cannabis. Subsequent to his release from custody, Mr Watson-Munro recounts that the prisoner was working with one of his brothers assisting in the promotion of a number of family nightclubs. This is confirmed by David Freedman, the manager of the UN/DCM nightclub who states in his reference (exhibit MI 2) that the prisoner was working as a door host at the nightclub which position the prisoner took very seriously and was very reliable. Mario Sande and Mick Gulasi also refer most favourably to the prisoner in their testimonials. (exhibits MI 1 and MI 3).  
     
      
    23 The prisoner has five older siblings. Both parents are in a poor state of health. His mother has a very close bond with her son which was strengthened during the period that her husband left home to travel to Lebanon in order to take on a second wife. Mr Watson-Munro states that the prisoner was then about three years of age and his father disappeared for about three years before returning to cause further problems in the household. The prisoner’s sister, Fifi Ibrahim, confirmed with the psychologist that upon her father’s return there were ongoing tensions in the home with the siblings tending to take sides as to their parental loyalties. Their father, Miss Ibrahim said, has held a grudge against his children since that time. Her father had a chronic gambling problem which further stretched the family resources. She told Mr Watson-Munro that the prisoner has been exceptionally protective of his mother over the years and his incarceration has served as a source of immense distress for each of them. 
     
      
    24 Mr Watson-Munro opines that it is apparent that these difficulties impacted upon the prisoner’s self-esteem at an early age, which in turn offers some explanation as to him drifting in with inappropriate company during his late adolescence.  
     
      
    25 It is clear, Mr Watson-Munro states, that the prisoner is suffering a broad range of symptoms suggestive of an Adjustment Disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria. This has arisen as a consequence of unresolved early childhood trauma and more recently his confinement but more specifically, longstanding feelings of remorse and sadness concerning the death of Robin Nassour. It is apparent, the psychologist says, that the prisoner requires continuing treatment. Mr Watson-Munro states that the prisoner impresses as an individual with some potential in life. He says that advisedly on the basis of his expressions of remorse and more specifically the manner in which he provided considerable support and comfort to his mother and siblings over the years. 
     
      
    26 I accept that the prisoner’s circumstances as a child were difficult. I also take into account the psychologist’s assessment of an Adjustment Disorder.  
     
      
    27 A mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence is that “the offender has shown remorse for the offence…..in any other manner”: s 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (SP) Act. The amendments made to s 21A(3)(i) by the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007 do not apply as the pleas of guilty in the present proceedings were accepted before 1 January 2008 and have not been withdrawn. The prisoner has by his plea of guilty accepted responsibility for his actions and the plea is an indication of his remorse and contrition. The Crown case of manslaughter against each of the prisoners was, however, very strong. His plea of guilty was, in my opinion, a recognition of the inevitable. The strength of the Crown case, I emphasise, is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse: See R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12].  
     
      
    28 During oral evidence Mr Watson-Munro said he did not have any reason to question the claimed remorse by the prisoner. On each occasion he had visited him at Long Bay the prisoner had “volunteered a great sense of regret regarding what has happened”: POS 30/11/07 p 29 L 7-8. The prisoner constantly ruminates about it, has sleep disturbance and wishes he could turn the clock back. The psychologist said that the prisoner “feels extremely sorry for the family of the deceased and wants to move forward with his life, but he feels that this is something that will never leave him. He said this on many occasions”: POS 30/11/07 p 29 L 13-17. Mr Watson-Munro had visited the prisoner on six occasions. His assessment of the genuineness of the prisoner’s sense of responsibility and remorse was, he said,: “As best I can tell”: POS 30/11/07 p 29 L 21. 
     
      
    29 Fifi Ibrahim during her evidence said that her brother feels “really sorry for the family of the deceased” and “just wishes he could turn back time when this happened, but he wants to take responsibility for what happened….” :POS 30/11/07 p 33 L 42-45. 
     
      
    30 I find it difficult to assess the extent of the prisoner’s remorse as he did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. It is troubling that Mr Ritcher QC in the submissions to which I have referred to at paragraph 12 (supra) suggests that the deceased in some way may have contributed to the prisoners’ assault upon him. These submissions, to my mind, are incompatible with genuine remorse and Mr Watson-Munro’s assessment. Nevertheless, I take into account the statements attributed to the prisoner by the psychologist and Fifi Ibrahim as demonstrating remorse for his offending.  
     
      
    31 The prisoner’s criminal history commences in 1996 and includes convictions as an adult for possession and supply of prohibited drugs, possession of an unauthorised firearm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, hinder investigation of a serious indictable offence and two counts of make a false statement on oath (not perjury). Other than the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm for which he was convicted and fined in the Local Court on 5 May 2000, there is one offence involving violence namely, a charge of malicious wounding, when he was a young person, for which he was released on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for 12 months and was fined in the Children’s Court. He was sentenced in the Local Court on 27 July 2005 to terms of imprisonment for the possession and supply of prohibited drugs, driving whilst disqualified, driving recklessly, hinder investigation of a serious indictable offence and make false statement. He appealed to the District Court and at the time of the present offence these appeals had not been heard. It appears that on 16 June 2006 the convictions were confirmed in the District Court at Penrith and he was sentenced to three concurrent or partially concurrent terms of imprisonment. The longest sentence imposed was a term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 16 June 2004 and concluding on 15 June 2006. 
     
      
    32 That criminal history deprives the prisoner of the considerations of leniency to which he may have been entitled if the current offence was an isolated act of criminality. His record of previous convictions is not a factor of aggravation.  
     
      
    33 At the time of the commission of the crime of manslaughter the prisoner was on bail for the offences the subject of his appeal to the District Court. It is an aggravating factor that the prisoner was on conditional liberty when the offence was committed: s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (SP) Act. I take into account that he was not on bail for an offence involving violence. There is no merit in Mr Ritcher’s further submission that the seriousness of the prisoner’s commission of the offence whilst on conditional liberty is lessened as it was “appeal bail”: POS 18/01/08 p 59-60.  
     
      
    34 Mr Watson-Munro expressed the view that the prisoner “is highly motivated towards rehabilitation with a view to returning to community in order to take on employment and to care for his mother”:(exhibit MI 4 p 7). An uncritical acceptance of the psychologist’s favourable assessment of the prisoner’s prospects of rehabilitation is not assisted by the commission of the present offence whilst the prisoner was on bail awaiting the hearing of his appeal. Sentences of imprisonment had been imposed in the Local Court. Furthermore, it appears from the prisoner’s custodial records that the prisoner was in custody from 7 August 2003 until 18 May 2005 being bail refused on charges which were subsequently not proceeded with. It is a matter of concern that the present offence was committed about eight months after his release. I accept, however, that the prisoner who is now 29 years old will have the support of his family and employment upon his release. The prisoner has reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. 35 I am unable to conclude on the probabilities that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend: s 21A(3)(g) Crimes (SP) Act.  
     
      
       
      
    36 The prisoner was arraigned with Sleiman Tajjour and Mouhamed Tajjour before Bell J when they each pleaded not guilty to a count of murder and a count of malicious wounding of George Nassour with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him. The prisoners’ trial on the counts upon which they had been arraigned had been listed to commence on Monday 2 October 2007. A jury panel, however, was not required on that day to enable preliminary matters to be raised. Ms Crown, on 2 October 2007, apprised the Court of ongoing discussions with counsel for the prisoners. On Friday 5 October 2007 Sleiman Tajjour and Mouhamed Tajjour entered pleas of guilty to an indictment specifying a single count of manslaughter. 37 Following these pleas of guilty an amended indictment was presented against Michael Ibrahim specifying a count of murder and a count of malicious wounding of George Nassour with intent to do grievous bodily harm to him. The prisoner pleaded not guilty to each count. Mr Richter then asked for George Nassour be made available for a Basha inquiry which was granted for the reasons set out in my judgment of 5 October 2007. Mr Nassour was called and cross-examined on the voire dire. The proceedings were adjourned to Monday 8 October 2007 when a jury was to be empanelled. On that day, Michael Ibrahim entered a plea of guilty to an indictment specifying a single count of manslaughter. 
     
      
    38 Mr Richter contends that the prisoner’s plea to manslaughter was entered at the first available opportunity. He argues, in short, that “there was no way possible of saying to the original indictment not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter, and not guilty of joining in the malicious wounding of George Nassour” POS 18/1/08 p 45 L13-18. He submits that it was on the withdrawal of that charge that it became possible to talk “about manslaughter in a final way”: POS 18/1/08 p 48 L 21. Ms Crown argues that the plea was not entered at the earliest possible time and points out that the offer of a plea to manslaughter was open to Mr Ibrahim at the time the Tajjours pleaded guilty. It was only after the voir dire was conducted that the plea of guilty was entered on the following Monday: POS 18/1/08 p 45 L 45-58. The Crown submits that the plea is to be regarded as a “late plea”.  
     
      
    39 It is evident from the application for the Basha enquiry that a critical issue was whether Michael Ibrahim had used a knife to stab the deceased. Because of changes in the position of George Nassour, the prisoner was entitled to cross-examine him to ascertain what he would say on oath at trial. I do not find, as the Crown contends, that the application for the voir dire was “totally inconsistent” with a desire to plead guilty at an early stage to manslaughter: POS 18/1/08 p 46 L 1-7. On the other hand, it was open to the prisoner to offer to plead guilty at an earlier stage to manslaughter on the facts which are presently agreed. I reject Mr Richter’s contention that this could not be done because of the second count of malicious wounding. An offer to plead to manslaughter on the present facts would not have prejudiced a defence to the second count. 
     
      
    40 Mr Richter submits that there was no offer made on Michael Ibrahim’s behalf “because when Mr Galloway gave evidence it became clear that it was made clear to Michael Ibrahim’s people by him that it was a waste of time to make the offer. Pointless”: POS 18/1/08 p 48 L 50-56. Mr Richter was there referring to testimony of Mr Galloway that he had a conversation with senior counsel then representing Mr Ibrahim at the committal hearing and had communicated the views of Ms Dobbs to her. 41 There is conflicting evidence from Mr Galloway, the solicitor who then acted for the Tajjour brothers on the one hand and Ms Dobbs, a solicitor with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who was then involved in this case on the other, as to whether an offer was made on behalf of the Tajjours to plead guilty to manslaughter at the time of the committal proceedings. Shortly stated, it was Mr Galloway’s evidence that he had a clear recollection of having a conversation with Ms Dobbs in her office at Burwood on the day of the committal in which he informed her he had instructions to put an offer of manslaughter. Ms Dobbs response was that she believed “they had a strong case for murder; that she would not recommend it”: POS 30/11/07 p 17 L 52-54. Mr Galloway then formed the view that he was wasting his time pressing it any further.  
     
      
    42 Ms Dobbs recalled, however, that Mr Galloway approached her and indicated “that his clients, Mouhamed and Sleiman Tajjour might be prepared to plead to manslaughter and did I think that the Crown would accept such a plea” to which she believed she said “not at this stage”. She believed she told him it was a matter for the Supreme Court arraignments prosecutor: POS 18/1/08 p 5 L 25-40. If a formal offer had been made to her, Ms Dobbs said, she would have briefed the Supreme Court arraignment Crown prosecutor with it which she did not do because she did not “regard it as a firm offer”: POS 18/1/08 p 9 L 22.  
     
      
    43 For present purposes it is unnecessary to resolve the conflict between Mr Galloway and Ms Dobbs.  
     
      
    44 I do not accept that a communication of Mr Galloway’s understanding of his conversation with Ms Dobbs would have persuaded senior counsel for Michael Ibrahim from making an offer to plead guilty to manslaughter if she had those instructions nor would it have deterred the prisoner’s legal representatives from exploring with the Director of Public Prosecutions the possibility of such a plea being accepted. Ms Dobbs deposed that she never had a discussion with anybody representing Michael Ibrahim about the possibility of a plea to manslaughter. There is no evidence that Michael Ibrahim had provided instructions at that stage to make an offer to plead to manslaughter.  
     
      
    45 There were, I am informed, informal discussions between Ms Crown and Mr Richter about the possibility of a plea to manslaughter for about “a month or two prior to the trial”: POS 18/1/08 p 45 L 35 – 36. It appears that the changes in George Nassour’s position and the second count complicated the possibility of an earlier resolution of the discussions. I do not accede to the Crown’s submission that this was a “late plea” nor do I find that the plea was entered at the first available opportunity. The entry of the plea saved the cost and inconvenience of the trial and in particular avoided George Nassour being required to give evidence once again.  
     
      
    46 Michael Ibrahim is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian effect of his plea which I assess at 15 per cent.  
     
      
    47 I have given careful consideration to the rehabilitation of the prisoner and the interests of the community in his rehabilitation. These matters, however, cannot outweigh the gravity of the offence. The importance of denunciation in sentencing for manslaughter has been stressed: see R v MacDonald at p8.  
     
      
    48 Victim impact statements of Amelia Nassour, the deceased’s mother, Lilian Nassour and Paula Nassour, the deceased’s sisters, and George Nassour were read to the Court. The contents of the statements cannot be used by me to increase the prisoner’s sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 97 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased’s family and express on the community’s behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.  
     
      
    49 It is agreed that Michael Ibrahim has been in custody for the present offence alone since 16 September 2006. From his custodial records it appears that the prisoner went into custody on 2 March 2006. He was sentenced as has been recounted at paragraph 31 (supra) in the District Court on 16 June 2006. A term of imprisonment of 12 months for the offence of supply was backdated to commence on 16 June 2005. The prisoner was sentenced to two years imprisonment for the offence of hinder investigation of a serious indictable offence to commence 16 June 2004 and to expire on 15 June 2006. For an offence of make false statement on oath (not perjury) a sentence of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 16 September 2005 and expiring on 15 September 2006 was imposed. 
     
      
    50 As the prisoner has served these sentences since he went into custody, it is necessary to consider the principle of totality: see Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. The offences for which the prisoner was sentenced in the District Court and the offence of manslaughter plainly are discrete and independent acts of criminality. This fact does not, however, finally determine whether the present sentence ought to be imposed concurrently, partially concurrently or consecutively: see Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1 per Howie J [at 27]. In the present case concurrency or partial concurrency would not adequately reflect the criminality of the offence of manslaughter. Accordingly, the date of the commencement of the sentence will be 16 September 2006. 
     
      
    51 The appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentence for Michael Ibrahim, I conclude, is 11 years. The sentence is reduced by 15 per cent to 9 years 4 months. 
     
      
    52 I find special circumstances as the present sentence has been made cumulative upon the existing sentence: see R v Simpson (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; R v Close (1992) 31 NSWLR 743 and, in my opinion, the prisoner’s rehabilitation upon release will be assisted by a longer period of supervision. By reason of the finding of special circumstances, I have assessed a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months. 
     
      
    53 Michael Ibrahim for the manslaughter of Robin Nassour I convict you. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months which is to commence on 16 September 2006 and is to expire on 15 March 2013. I set a balance of term of 2 years 10 months which is to commence on 16 March 2013 and is to expire on 15 January 2016.  
     
      
    54 The earliest date of eligibility for your release to parole is 15 March 2013.

     KRYSZTOF NOWAK v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court following his plea of guilty to an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for seven years. The applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 12 months with the total term being one of 3 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The facts giving rise to the offence are not in dispute and can be briefly stated. The applicant and the victim were among a number of guests at a wedding ceremony and reception. During the course of the evening, friends of the applicant were involved in a disagreement with a man who was part of the bridal party. As the evening progressed, the applicant and three of his friends were asked to leave the reception by members of the families of both the bride and the groom. This followed a heated exchange in which friends of the applicant on the one hand, and the members of the families of the bride and groom on the other, had sworn at each other. 
     
      
    3 The offender and his three friends began walking down the driveway from the reception to the roadway, a distance of about 70 metres. The applicant had in his possession a 700 ml glass Vodka bottle which, he maintained, was still sealed and full. The bride’s father was walking behind the applicant and his friends in order to ensure that they left the premises. 
     
      
    4 As he reached the exit gate to the driveway, the applicant turned to face the victim who was in close proximity to the bride’s father. The applicant then swung the glass bottle which he was holding and struck the victim with it. The glass bottle shattered upon impact with the victim’s face. The victim sustained significant cuts to his face. The cuts began to bleed profusely and the victim’s eyes filled with blood. They then blackened and closed. The victim also sustained a broken nose as a result of the blow to his face. 
     
      
    5 Two days later the victim was examined by a general practitioner who reported that he had “multiple injuries to the chest and face. His face was very swollen, with large bruises over his eyes, nose and cheeks. He had lacerations over his forehead, nose and cheeks which had been sutured in hospital.” The victim was then referred to an ear, nose and throat specialist because he reported having difficulty breathing as a result of having had his nose broken. He was operated on and his nasal fractures were elevated and the septum was returned to its original position. It appears that the operation was a success although the victim was required to wear a plaster over his nose for a period of three weeks following the operation. The sentencing judge aptly described photographs of the victim as depicting an “horrific facial injury”.  
     
      
    6 Six weeks after the incident, the applicant voluntarily attended Quakers Hill police station where he was immediately placed under arrest. He then participated in a recorded interview during which he admitted having smashed the bottle over the victim’s face. He said that he regretted his actions and that if he had his time over again he would have done things differently. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was 21 at the time of the offence and 22 when he stood for sentence. He had been attending university and was within six months of completing his Bachelor of Science degree. He was also working part-time. He had no prior convictions and was otherwise of good character. A number of references attested to the fact that his conduct was completely out of character and that he had the on-going support of his family.  
     
      
    8 The applicant gave evidence during the course of the sentencing proceedings. He accepted that he was heavily affected by alcohol having, on his own admission, consumed 10 drinks of bourbon at the reception. He conceded that that was typical of the amount of alcohol that he consumed on social occasions. The sentencing judge was understandably concerned about that aspect of his evidence particularly as the applicant had informed an officer from the Probation Service, when questioned about the issue, that he was “adamant that he has never had a problem abusing alcohol”. The sentencing judge nevertheless concluded that the applicant clearly had a problem with binge drinking. 
     
      
    9 The applicant gave evidence that he had done nothing himself to warrant being asked to leave the function. He gave evidence that as he and his friends were walking down the driveway, the groom’s father and two of his friends were following them. He said that there was a lot of swearing and pushing. He said that at the end of the driveway he saw the groom’s father grab his friend’s father by the shirt. He also claimed to have been pushed before swinging the bottle. He again expressed his regret for his actions and acknowledged that what he had done was horrific. 
     
      
    10 Towards the end of the sentencing remarks her Honour made the following observations: 
     
      
       
        
        There are a number of factors present which do aggravate the objective seriousness of the offence. They are, as I have already said, the use of the weapon to inflict the injuries, and the force used when using that weapon. Secondly, the extent of the injuries sustained, and I will not repeat what I said earlier about that. Obviously the extent of injury is an element of the offence. However, these injuries were not injuries not only requiring medical treatment, they were injuries requiring both medical and surgical intervention. So to that extent they are substantial, and it does affect the objective seriousness of the offence. Thirdly, the victim was unarmed and unable to protect himself, and in that sense he was vulnerable in the extreme. 
        
       
       
      
    11 As the applicant had first entered his plea in the Local Court, the sentencing judged extended to him a discount of 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of that plea. The sentencing judge also found that the applicant was genuinely remorseful for his actions and noted that he had expressed a willingness to make a personal apology to the victim. The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and that his prospects of rehabilitation were good, particularly if he was able to curb his anger and his alcohol intake. Although her Honour rejected a submission that some order other than one entailing a full-time custodial sentence was appropriate she was prepared, for the reasons I have just identified, to make a finding of special circumstances which had the consequence that the normal statutory ratio was varied to produce the result to which I earlier referred. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    12 The applicant relied upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1 That the sentence imposed by the Learned Sentencing Judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        2 That the sentencing Judge erred in finding that there were aggravating features present including: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2.1 The use of the weapon to inflict the injuries and the force used. 
           
          2.2 The extent of the injuries sustained. 
           
          2.3 That the victim was vulnerable in the extreme. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        3 That the Sentencing Judge erred in finding that there was no provocation on the part of the victim. 
        
       
      
    13 It is convenient to first deal with the ground that asserts that the sentencing judge erred in finding that three features of the case constituted aggravating factors. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge erred in treating as an aggravating factor the use of a weapon to inflict the injuries and the force used 
       
      
    14 As I have indicated, the sentencing judge found that there “are a number of factors present which do aggravate the objective seriousness of the offence. They are, as I have already said, the use of the weapon to inflict injuries and the force used when using that weapon.” The weapon in question was the glass bottle. Section 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        the offence involved the actual or threatened use of a weapon 
        
       
      
    15 The court is enjoined of course from having additional regard to any such aggravating factor if it is an element of the offence: s21A(2). That expression has been interpreted to include a matter which would be regarded as an inherent characteristic of the offence: see R v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43. 
     
      
    16 The offence of which the applicant was convicted, which has since been repealed, was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        35 Malicious wounding or infliction of grievous bodily harm 
        
       
       
        
        (1) Whosoever maliciously by any means: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) wounds any person, or 
           
          (b) inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        shall be liable to imprisonment for 7 years. 
        
       
      
    17 It was contended that one of the elements of the offence is “by any means” and thus “the means by which the applicant wounded or otherwise inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the victim is not an additional aggravating factor”. The short answer to the submission is that the expression “by any means” is neither an element nor an inherent characteristic of the offence. Indeed the fact that the legislature included that expression in the offence serves only to demonstrate that there are a very great number of ways or “means” by which grievous bodily harm may be inflicted. That being so, the sentencing judge did not fall into error in regarding the actual use of the bottle as a weapon as an aggravating feature. The court was referred to a number of authorities in support of this ground but none of them bear upon the question currently being considered. 
     
      
    18 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge erred in finding that the extent of the injuries sustained by the victim amounted to an aggravating factor 
       
      
    19 The sentencing judge found that “the extent of the injuries sustained” was a further factor which aggravated the objective seriousness of the offence. It was submitted that the sentencing judge fell into error in having regard to s 21A(2)(g) of the Act which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial 
         
        
       
      
    20 As it is clearly an element of the offence that grievous bodily harm was inflicted, it was submitted that an injury warranting that description would necessarily be substantial. 
     
      
    21 In support of that submission the applicant relied upon this Court’s decision in R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264. The offender in that case pleaded guilty to a charge of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm after having stabbed the victim in the back causing very severe injuries to him. The victim underwent surgery and remained in intensive care for over a month. Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        I note that his Honour also referred in his judgment to s21A(2)(g): that the injury caused by the offence was substantial. Although no objection was taken on this basis during the course of this appeal, it would appear to me that this aspect of his Honour’s reasoning suffers from the same defect as that identified above with respect to s21A(2)(b). The offence under s33 requires the infliction of grievous bodily harm. Where that is an element of the offence, the injury is necessarily “substantial”. Accordingly, I do not take into account, unlike his Honour, the degree of injury as an aggravating factor. (par 65) 
        
       
      
    22 Earlier the sentencing judge had observed that “the offence itself is an objectively serious one, demonstrating a significant degree of violence, resulting in substantial injuries to the victim”. No criticism was, or could be, raised in respect of those observations. A sentencing court is entitled to have regard to the extent of the injuries in assessing the objective seriousness of a particular offence so long of course as the principles in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 are not infringed: see, for example, R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at pars 106-107. However, to treat as an additional aggravating factor that the injury was substantial in an offence of the present type does bespeak error of the kind referred to in Cramp (supra): see also R v Jammeh [2004] NSWCCA 327 at par 23; R v Murphy [2005] NSWCCA 182 at pars 22-25.  
     
      
    23 Having concluded that the extent of the injuries was a further factor of aggravation, her Honour then went on to say that “obviously the extent of injury is an element of the offence. However, these injuries were not injuries not only requiring medical treatment, they were injuries requiring both medical and surgical intervention. So to that extent they are substantial, and it does affect the objective seriousness of the offence.” 
     
      
    24 It is not entirely clear what her Honour was endeavouring to convey in that passage. It may be that she was suggesting that the particular injuries which the victim sustained went beyond what would be expected to result from the commission of this type of offence: see R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412. In R v Solomon (2005) 153 A Crim R 32 Howie J, with whom Grove and Latham JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        [t]here may be cases at the margin where some judgment might have to be made about whether the severity of the effect of a particular offence on a particular victim is such that the offence should be considered to be aggravated. (at par 20) 
        
       
      
    25 The present case may have been of that type. But if that is the conclusion at which her Honour arrived, then one would have expected her Honour to have said so in clear and unambiguous terms before deciding to treat it as an additional feature of aggravation. I am not entirely persuaded that such a finding was, in any event, open on the evidence before the sentencing judge, particularly as no victim impact statement was made available which may have shed light on the matter.  
     
      
    26 For those reasons I am of the view that the sentencing judge has fallen into error and accordingly, I would uphold this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge erred in finding that it was an aggravating factor that the victim was vulnerable in the extreme 
       
      
    27 The sentencing judge held that the third feature of aggravation was that “the victim was unarmed and unable to protect himself and in that sense he was vulnerable in the extreme”. The sentencing judge in making those remarks was purporting to rely upon s 21A(2)(l) which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        the victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young or very old or had a disability, or because of the victim’s occupation (such as a taxi driver, bus driver or other public transport worker, bank teller or service station attendant) 
        
       
      
    28 The fact that the victim was unarmed when struck by a man wielding a bottle was a highly relevant factor in an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. It is true that he was rendered vulnerable to the applicant’s attack. All victims are, to some extent at least, vulnerable. But that is not the sense in which the expression is to be understood in the present context. 
     
      
    29 In R v Tadrosse (2005) 65 NSWLR 740, Howie J, with whom Grove and Hall JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        Before s 21A(2) was enacted, the common law recognised that there were certain categories or classes of persons who needed to be especially protected because they were particularly vulnerable to criminal offences generally or a criminal offence of a particular type. Of course the purpose of sentencing is to protect the community generally and this is achieved by each of the aims of sentencing such as deterrence, denunciation and rehabilitation. But an aggravating factor is something that operates over and above the general considerations that indicate that a particular class of offending should generally be dealt with in a particular way.  
        
       
       
        
        It may well be the case the persons generally in the community would be vulnerable to a proficient fraudster armed with forged documents such as a driver’s licence because it is common to rely upon such documents as proof of identity. But that fact does not give rise to an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(l). That provision is concerned with the weakness of a particular class of victim and not with the threat posed by a particular class of offender.  
        
       
       
        
        In  
        R v Williams 
         [2005] NSWCCA 99 this Court held that a sentencing judge was in error in taking into account as an aggravating factor under the section that the victim of a manslaughter offence was vulnerable. Buddin J with whom the other members of the Court agreed stated:  
         
          
           
          [40]……………The sentencing judge concluded that the deceased was vulnerable, as I understand his Honour’s reasons, upon the basis that the applicant was a powerful man who had violent tendencies, whereas the deceased did not have those characteristics. That was clearly a matter that was relevant to an assessment of the objective gravity of the offence. It should not however have been treated as a factor which further aggravated the offence.  
           
           
          [41] In any event all victims of a homicide can be said to be vulnerable. In my view, s 21A(2)(l) is not directed to vulnerability in that generalized sense. Indeed, the examples set out in the subparagraph suggest that it is vulnerability of a particular kind that attracts its operation. 
          
         
         
        The Judge in the present case was in error into taking into account in any manner that the victims of the applicant’s offences were vulnerable. (pars 25-7) 
        
       
      
    30 It should also be observed that the Crown did not suggest, during the course of making submissions on sentence, that this particular matter was an aggravating factor. That of itself, in my view, is a very good reason why the sentencing judge should have been loathe to find that it was and in particular, to conclude that the victim was vulnerable “in the extreme”. 
     
      
    31 In my view, this ground of appeal has also been made out. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing judge erred in finding that there was no provocation on the part of the victim 
       
      
    32 The sentencing judge declined to find that “there was some minor form of provocation”. Her Honour of course had the benefit of observing the applicant give evidence, an advantage which is denied to this Court. It is apparent from her Honour’s remarks that she was of the view that whatever occurred at the exit of the premises was only what one would expect when one group of people was escorting another group from the premises and ensuring that they did not return. It is also clear that her Honour was of the view that the applicant’s perception of events was to be assessed against the background of his state of intoxication. That being so, it is apparent that her Honour was not prepared to uncritically accept everything that the applicant said in his evidence. 
     
      
    33 In any event, this ground of appeal represents no more than a challenge to a finding of fact. In my view, this ground of appeal must inevitably fail particularly as it was well open to the sentencing judge to arrive at the conclusion which she reached. Even if her Honour had been in error, then such provocation as there might have been, could have had only a minimal impact upon the appropriate sentencing outcome. 
     
      
       
      The sentence imposed by the learned sentencing judge was too severe having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances of the offence 
       
      
    34 In my view, this was a most serious offence of its kind. As the sentencing judge observed it was “a cowardly attack upon an innocent victim” which was entirely “unwarranted”. The blow, which the offender administered, must have been of very considerable force to have first caused the bottle to shatter and then to have caused the injuries which the victim sustained. Despite the fact that the offence represented a spontaneous, rather than a premeditated outburst of anger, and even after having given full weight to the applicant’s favourable subjective case, I am not persuaded that her Honour exceeded the legitimate range of her sentencing discretion in imposing sentence. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    35 Notwithstanding the two errors that I have identified, which to my mind in the present context, at least, are of an essentially semantic kind, I have concluded that no other sentence was warranted in law and ought to have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    36 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    37 BELL JA: I agree 
     
      
    38 BARR J: I also agree.

     B & Ors v REGINA 
     
     
      
       
      FACTS 
       
      The applicants were charged on an indictment alleging a single count that they “did conspire with each other and divers others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act (or acts)”. The applicants challenged the sufficiency of the indictment, alleging inter alia that: it was defective on the ground of duplicity; it was a nullity on the ground that the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions to commence proceedings was not properly obtained; and that it did not disclose an offence known to the law. Whealy J dismissed those applications. 
       
       
      The applicants appeal to the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal from the judgments of Whealy J.

      Patent Duplicity 
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, James and Howie JJ agreeing 
       
      1 The interpretation of a code can refer to the pre-existing common law where a technical legal term has been adopted. [28]-[33], [109], [110]

        (1975) 134 CLR 1 applied. 
        
       
       
      2 The word “offence” appears in the singular in s 11.5 of the  
      Criminal Code 
      . Section 23 of the  
      Acts Interpretation Act  
      1901 (Cth) operates to encompass the plural unless there are indications to the contrary [17]–[18], [23]-[26], [109], [110]

      3 The nature of the offence of conspiracy strongly indicates that there is no intention to the contrary of s 23 of the  
      Acts Interpretation Act 
      . [22], [109], [110] 
       
       
      4 Having regard to the scheme of the Code and its common law roots, the references to ‘conspiracy’ are of a technical legal character based on well established common law meanings. The references to conspiracy were intended to reflect the common law. [29], [31] [33] - [34], [109], [110] 
       
       
      5 The common law of conspiracy encompasses an agreement leading to multiple offences. In enacting the Code, the Parliament did not overturn this long established proposition. [21] - [22], [109], [110] 
       
       
      6 The submission that the indictment is duplicitous for asserting an agreement to do acts in preparation a single terrorist act or multiple terrorist acts should be rejected. Preparatory acts for terrorism may occur where the precise nature of a terrorist act has yet to be decided and whether or not it has been decided that there would be more than one such act. There is no duplicity by pleading the statutory provision identifying ‘forbidden characteristics’. [43] - [50], [109], [110]

      Latent Duplicity 
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, James and Howie JJ agreeing 
       
      7 Latent ambiguity or latent duplicity is a recognised form of duplicity which may, in the appropriate case, lead to the quashing of an indictment. [52], [109], [110]

         (1990) 19 NSWLR 656 referred to. 
        
       
       
      8 An order to quash the indictment, as sought by the appellants, would be a rare remedy even where duplicity is identified. The appropriate step upon finding duplicity is to put the prosecutor to an election or to provide particulars or to require appropriate directions. [59] - [60], [109], [110]

      9 On the findings of fact by Whealy J it cannot be said at this stage of the proceedings, that it is appropriate, let alone necessary, to conclude that the nature of the Crown case is such that multiple agreements need to be dealt with by the accused or may be found by the jury. [65], [69], [72], [73], [109], [110] 
       
       
      10 Where there is a single criminal enterprise, like a conspiracy, it is appropriate to charge multiple acts in a single count. [71], [74], [79], [109], [110]

      Consent 
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, James and Howie JJ agreeing 
       
      11 For the purposes of s 11.5(8) of the  
      Criminal Code Act  
      1995 (Cth), the time at which proceedings are “commenced” is not determined by s 53 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act  
      1986. [84]–[86], [109], [110] 
       
       
      12 The existence of the term “remand” in s 11.5(8) of the  
      Criminal Code Act  
      1995 (Cth) indicates that that section does not require that the relevant consent be given before a court attendance notice, where there is a committal. [87], [109], [110] 
       
       
      Offence unknown to the law 
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, James and Howie JJ agreeing 
       
      13 Although an agreement to commit acts in preparation for a terrorist act could itself be a preparatory act, this does not involve the kind of absurdity found in

     B & Ors v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The applicants stand charged in the Supreme Court upon an indictment on a single count as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other and divers others to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act (or acts).” 
        
       
      
    2 Detailed particulars of the preparatory acts and of the terrorist act or acts have been supplied, together with considerable elaboration in the form of a 181 page Crown Case Statement. 
     
      
    3 Each applicant sought orders that the proceeding be dismissed or the indictment quashed on a number of grounds. Whealy J, in his judgments dated 18 March 2008 and 19 March 2008, rejected each application. The applicants seek leave to appeal to this Court from some parts of those judgments. 
     
      
    4 Each applicant seeks leave to appeal to this Court on the grounds of alleged duplicity in the indictment seeking, if leave be granted, that the indictment be quashed on that basis. Mr B Walker SC appeared with Mr I Nash for all the applicants on the duplicity issue. 
     
      
    5 The applicants Khaled Cheikho, Mirsad Mulahalilovic and Mazen Touma also seek leave to appeal with respect to two other matters determined by Whealy J. The first alleges that the offence was unknown to the law. The second alleges that the necessary consent to the commencement of proceedings was not granted at the appropriate time. A third ground of appeal contained in the application for leave by these three applicants is not presently before the Court. 
     
      
    6 Mr C Waterstreet appeared with Mr P Lange for these applicants. He adopts the submissions of Mr Walker on duplicity and raises an additional argument with respect to that issue. Ms W Abraham QC appeared with Ms S McNaughton for the Crown. 
     
      
    7 The offence of conspiracy is created by s 11.5 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “11.5(1) A person who conspires with another person to commit an offence punishable by imprisonment for more than 12 months, or by a fine of 200 penalty units or more, is guilty of the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence to which the conspiracy relates had been committed. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the person to be guilty: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person must have entered into an agreement with one or more other persons; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2A) Subsection (2) has effect subject to subsection (7A). 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A person may be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence even if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) committing the offence is impossible; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the only other party to the agreement is a body corporate; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) each other party to the agreement is at least one of the following: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) a person who is not criminally responsible; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) a person for whose benefit or protection the offence exists; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) subject to paragraph (4)(a), all other parties to the agreement have been acquitted of the conspiracy. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) A person cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) all other parties to the agreement have been acquitted of the conspiracy and a finding of guilt would be inconsistent with their acquittal; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) he or she is a person for whose benefit or protection the offence exists. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (5) A person cannot be found guilty of conspiracy to commit an offence if, before the commission of an overt act pursuant to the agreement, the person: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) withdrew from the agreement; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) took all reasonable steps to prevent the commission of the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (6) A court may dismiss a charge of conspiracy if it thinks that the interests of justice require it to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) Any defences, procedures, limitations or qualifying provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (7A) Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of conspiracy to commit that offence. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) Proceedings for an offence of conspiracy must not be commenced without the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, a person may be arrested for, charged with, or remanded in custody or on bail in connection with, an offence of conspiracy before the necessary consent has been given.” 
        
       
      
    8 The offence which the applicants are said to have conspired to commit is set out in the indictment and refers to s 101.6 of the Code which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “101.6(1) A person commits an offence if the person does any act in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A person commits an offence under subsection (1) even if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a terrorist act does not occur; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person’s act is not done in preparation for or planning a specific terrorist act; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person’s act is done in preparation for, or planning, more than one terrorist act.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 The words “terrorist act” are further defined in a manner which it is not necessary to set out. 
     
      
    10 The proceedings before Whealy J are complex and are likely to take many months. If there is a defect in the indictment it is of considerable significance for the administration of justice that it be determined before the proceedings are significantly advanced. Nevertheless, leave to appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should only be given if a substantive issue appropriate for resolution at this stage has been raised.  
     
      
       
      Duplicity 
       
      
    11 The principles of law relating to duplicity in an indictment were not in issue. The relevant authorities are well known and serve as the starting point of the submissions in this case. The parties referred, inter alia, to Johnson v Miller (1937) 59 CLR 467; S v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 266 and Walsh v Tattersall [1996] HCA 26; (1996) 188 CLR 77. Mr Walker referred to the particular difficulties that may arise in this respect in the context of a conspiracy count and referred the Court to the judgments of Murphy J and Deane J in Gerakiteys v The Queen (1984) 153 CLR 317 and to the observations of Sir Frederick Jordan in R v Ongley (1940) 57 WN (NSW) 116. 
     
      
    12 Whealy J, in his judgment of 18 March 2008, rejected the submissions on duplicity as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[128] I think that the simple answer to all these submissions is that the indictment in the present matter charges but one single agreement. In that regard, it is not patently duplicitous. Secondly, when one has regard to the particulars supplied and the Crown Cast Statement, the situation is precisely the same. It is not latently duplicitous. The Crown relies on but one agreement and the charge is, as a consequence, not patently duplicitous. 
        
       
       
        
        [129] It is true that the agreement charged is one to do a number of acts, which may constitute a number of offences. As I apprehend it, that does not make the single count in the indictment duplicitous. This is commonly done and has been accepted by the courts over a long period of time. … the Code does not require that a conspiracy charge be limited to an agreement to commit one offence only. 
        
       
       
        
        [130] In relation to the expression ‘a terrorist act or acts’ I must say that my initial reaction was that I was unsure as to why the Crown wished to express the charge in these terms. … 
        
       
       
        
        [131] But, on reflection, it seems to me that the expression is not, in any event, duplicitous in the context of the present indictment. There are two reasons for this. The first emerges from the discussions both by myself and later by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the various  
        Lodhi  
        decisions. Those decisions make it clear that an act done in preparation for a terrorist act as I mentioned earlier, may occur in situations where the precise nature of the terrorist act may be uncertain. … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [135] The Crown case is that the agreement was one to obtain the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act or acts. This involved the conspirators equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to prepare for or plan a terrorist act or acts. 
        
       
       
        
        [136] Although it will not always be the case, an agreement of this kind commonly will mean that neither the conspirators themselves, nor anyone else, will have finally determined the precise nature of the terrorist act to be implemented. It may not fall to the parties to the agreement to do so. Because this is so, there may be the real possibility that there will be more than one terrorist act ultimately carried out, even though that decision has yet been made. Indeed, s 101.6(2)(c), which I have set out earlier, contemplates that a single act of preparation may be an act done in preparation for more than one terrorist act. It must follow that a single agreement to do a number of acts might contemplate acts done in preparation for more than one terrorist act. That this is so will not [transform] one agreement into more than one. 
        
       
       
        
        [137] Secondly, there are many cases in which a conspiracy having been formed, there are changes and alterations occurring during the life of the conspiracy … It is clear that a conspiracy, once formed, is capable of remaining a single offence notwithstanding that during its currency, a number of identifiable and separate acts within its general purpose may come to be carried into effect. … 
        
       
       
        
        [138] This raises, perhaps, a different question. But it provides a framework for understanding that, in the present matter, there is but one agreement. … The physical and fault elements required for a charge of conspiracy under the Code are the single physical element of conduct to enter into the proscribed agreement; and the fault element, being the intention to enter into the agreement. In addition, a person and at least one other party to the agreement must have intended that an offence would be committed pursuant to the agreement; and the person and at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement. (Section 11.5(2)(b) and (c). See Howie J in  
        Ansari  
        at paras 63 to 66; and Simpson J, in the same case, at [par] 32 where her Honour referred to the intention mentioned in 11.5(2)(b) as being a different intention from the fault element intention necessary to support the physical element. 
        
       
       
        
        [139] The point I am addressing here is Mr Buscombe’s submission that the expression ‘preparation for a terrorist act or acts’ connotes two agreements. I do not think this is right. Moreover, Mr Buscombe alleged that the fault element ‘intention’ in s 11.5(1) might be different intention in the case of an agreement to do an act in preparation for the destruction of a particular building, whereas a different intention would be required to do an act or acts in preparation for the destruction of a number of buildings. On the indictment charge here, the Crown must prove as a physical element and, as a fault element, an intention to enter into the specified agreement. There will however, be but one agreement and one intention. In addition, there will be a need to prove a further intention, namely an intention to commit the offences represented by the offences contemplated by the agreement itself. This ‘ulterior intention’ is also but one intention: it is not more than one. The Crown must prove that it was the intention of the conspirators to obtain the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act or acts. This ‘ulterior intention’ is the subject matter of the offence or offences described in s 11.5. 
        
       
       
        
        [140] The fact that no decision has been made as to the precise nature of the terrorist act or acts to be carried out; the fact that no target or targets have been finally selected, and that no final decision has been made as to who will carry out the terrorist act or acts does not, in my view, render the charge in the indictment duplicitous.” 
        
       
      
    13 In [135] his Honour employed the phrase “equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to prepare for or plan a terrorist act or acts”. In [138] his Honour referred to “activities … undertaken by the conspirators to obtain the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act or acts”.  
     
      
    14 These two references reflect a particular paragraph in the Crown Case Statement, as distinct from the indictment itself and the specific particulars given which stated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “4 In accordance with the holding of those common beliefs, the accused entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act (or terrorist acts). This involved equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to prepare for or plan a terrorist act (or terrorist acts). In furtherance of the agreement the accused amongst other things: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) obtained or attempted to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used, directly and/or indirectly, in the construction of an explosive device; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) obtained or attempted to obtain weaponry and ammunition; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) possessed large amounts of extremist and instructional material.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    15 This summary elucidates the Crown case in a pithy manner. 
     
      
       
      Patent Duplicity 
       
      
    16 Mr Waterstreet advanced a case of patent duplicity in this Court which had been put to Whealy J on behalf of all accused, but which Mr Walker did not press in this Court for the applicants not represented by Mr Waterstreet. 
     
      
    17 Mr Waterstreet submitted that the formulation in s 11.5(1) — “conspires to commit an offence” — is deliberately singular so that, unlike the position at common law, it is not possible to allege a conspiracy to commit more than one offence. The indictment in this case is bad, he submitted, because it alleges an agreement to commit more than one act in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Mr Waterstreet submitted that the longstanding position at common law, which permitted such a charge, had been changed by the Code. 
     
      
    18 The Crown invoked s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) which provides, in the usual form: “words in the singular number include the plural”. This section operates subject to any indication to the contrary. Mr Waterstreet submitted that there are such indications in the use of the singular form throughout s 11.5. He also submitted that the special provisions for penalty and defences would become unworkable if it were possible to charge a conspiracy to commit more than one offence. 
     
      
    19 The first provision relied upon is s 11.5(1) which establishes that the maximum penalty for the conspiracy is that stipulated for the offence to which the conspiracy relates. At best this fact, if it be pertinent at all, would require a separate pleading for each kind of offence — if there be more than one — perhaps in the alternative. That this may be required is suggested by Ansari v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 204; (2007) 173 A Crim R 112 where Howie J indicated at [63] that there is one composite physical element in s 11.5(1), namely, “conspires to commit an offence”. However, this analysis says nothing about the present case where what is alleged is multiple incidents of the same offence under s 106.6. 
     
      
    20 The three applicants also rely on the defence and special liability provisions in s 11.5(7) and s 11.5(7A). Again, those provisions cannot arise in the present case. What would be the position if quite different offences were relied upon need not be decided. 
     
      
    21 The essence of the crime of conspiracy has always been the element of combination which, as has often been emphasised, can constitute an enhanced danger to the community over and above the commission of the offences themselves. All forms of organised crime, perhaps most notably in the drug trade, manifest this proposition. It is a perspective which applies with particular force to terrorism. 
     
      
    22 The proposition that the Parliament, when enacting the Code, had strayed so far from this critical social purpose so as to overturn the long established practice which criminalises an agreement leading to multiple offences only needs to be stated to be rejected. The very nature of the offence strongly indicates that there is no intention to the contrary of s 23 of the Acts Interpretation Act. 
     
      
    23 The application of this Interpretation Act provision has frequently arisen in criminal contexts, including with respect to the use of the word “offence” in its singular form. It has arisen in both common law States and Code states. The nature of the offence is always a critical, and often determinative, matter in this regard. However, the whole legislative scheme must be considered. The singular form of the statutory provision is rarely significant, no doubt because parliamentary drafters have long since adjusted their drafting practice to facilitate clarity and economy of expression, in reliance on provisions such as s 23. (See Blue Metal Industries Ltd v Dilley (1969) 117 CLR 651 at 656.) 
     
      
    24 Sometimes the result of this consideration is that the Parliament intended singularity with respect to a criminal offence. (See R v Ruddell [2006] 1 Qd R 361; Walsh v Tattersall esp at 91, 101; R v Giam [1999] NSWCCA 53; (1999) 104 A Crim R 416 at [16]–[23]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Stark [2006] VSCA 61.) 
     
      
    25 On other occasions, the singular form was interpreted to encompass the plural. (R v Wyles; Ex parte Attorney-General [1977] Qd R 169; Coward v Allan (1984) 52 ALR 320; Commissioner of Taxation v Cocaj [2004] QCA 69; [2004] 2 Qd R 488; R v CDR (No 2) [1996] 1 Qd R 69; R v Armstrong [1996] 1 Qd R 316; R v Poulier [2007] NTCCA 4; (2007) 19 NTLR 91.) Not all of these cases can be readily reconciled with each other (eg Ruddell with Poulier or Stark with Wyles). Nevertheless, different results are to be expected because the nature of the offence and aspects of the context and history of the legislative schemes will diverge. 
     
      
    26 The issue has also arisen in a Code state with respect to the offence of conspiracy. Section 541(1) of the Criminal Code Act 1899 (Qld) created an offence in terms of “Any person who conspires with another to commit any crime … which is an offence”. In R v Moore [1988] 1 Qd R 252 at 254, Macrossan J proceeded on the basis that this section reflected the common law position in which a charge could allege a single agreement to commit a number of offences. 
     
      
    27 The analysis by Whealy J on this issue turned in significant measure on the pre-existing common law position with respect to charging a single conspiracy for the commission of multiple offences. His Honour’s analysis applied to both s 11.5(1) of the Code and its predecessor provision, expressed in virtually identical terms, found in s 86 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). In my opinion, his Honour was correct to have regard to the common law in this regard. 
     
      
    28 The general approach to interpretation of a Code is well established. As Windeyer J put it in Vallance v The Queen (1961) 108 CLR 56 at 75: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Code is to be read without any preconception that any particular provision has or has not altered the law.” 
        
       
      
    29 Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which the interpretation of a Code which, like any other statute, must involve reference to the full context of the specific provision that falls to be interpreted. This extends to the legal history of the particular provision and of the terminology in which it has been expressed. 
     
      
    30 In Stuart v The Queen (1974) 134 CLR 426 at 437, Gibbs J rejected the proposition that “it is never necessary to resort to the common law for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a Code” and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “it may be justifiable to turn back to the common law where the Code contains provisions of doubtful import, or uses language which had previously acquired a technical meaning, or on some such special ground”. 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      Bank of England v Vagliano Brothers  
      [1891] AC 107 at 145;  
      R v Barlow  
      [1997] HCA 18; (1997) 188 CLR 1 at 19; and  
      Sungravure Pty Ltd v Middle East Airlines Airliban SAL  
      (1975) 134 CLR 1 at 22.) 
       
      
    31 In my opinion, the references to “conspiracy” found in the Code are of a technical legal character for purposes of the application of these principles. The terminology which the drafters of the Code used were words and phrases which had well established legal meanings. Generally, the legal meanings did not differ from dictionary meanings. As Windeyer J put it in Vallance at 75: 
     
      
       
        
        “Law may define the forbidden conduct more fully and more precisely than in common speech is ordinarily necessary; but it does not define it differently.” 
        
       
      
    32 His Honour went on to give an example: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The Code] does not define ‘maim’, but that word is used in it. In ordinary speech it means a crippling injury, such as the loss of a limb. The meaning is the same for law, but the specific test by which early law distinguished [maim] from lesser injuries was by asking whether the harm would make a man less able for fighting. The test produced some strange decisions. That is an illustration of the meaning of a word in the Code being fixed by the common law.” 
        
       
      
    33 In my opinion, the references to “conspiracy” found in the Code was also, intended by the drafters of the Code to be “fixed by the common law”, subject to any express statutory modification (cf R v Wyles at 177–182). As Whealy J notes, the authors of the offence creating provision in s 11.5(1) adopted the terminology of the pre-existing Commonwealth offence in s 86 of the Crimes Act. That section was itself clearly derived from the common law and was not subject to the special rules for interpreting a code. 
     
      
    34 Furthermore, it is clear from the full text of s 11.5 that the authors of the conspiracy provisions of the Code paid careful attention to the pre-existing common law and to debates about the appropriateness of charges of conspiracy, in lieu of substantive offences. That appears most clearly from the identification of the particular requirements of a finding of guilt of a charge of conspiracy set out in subss 11.5(2), (3), (4) and (5). Like the general discretion introduced in subs (6), these matters reflect decisions and debates that have occurred about the application of the crime of conspiracy at common law.  
     
      
    35 I am reinforced in this conclusion by the Report of the Criminal Law Officers Committee, on which s 11.5 is clearly based. That Report identifies the need for such an offence and its detail by reference to the case law and debate about the crime of conspiracy at common law. (See Criminal Law Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, Model Criminal Code, Chapter 2: General Principles of Criminal Responsibility (1992) at 96ff (“MCCOC Report”)). The MCCOC Report is of assistance in determining that the offence of conspiracy under the Code intended to implement the common law, save in identified respects. (See Ansari at [64]–[66].)  
     
      
    36 This conclusion is quite unsurprising. Conspiracy offences in those States with a Criminal Code have frequently been interpreted by reference to the common law principles. Accordingly, the texts on the Queensland and Western Australian Codes frequently invoke common law cases to explain the code provisions. (See eg LexisNexis Butterworths, Carter’s Criminal Law of Queensland, vol 1 (at Services 75 and 64) at [s 541.20]–[s 541.55]; LexisNexis Butterworths, Criminal Law Western Australia, vol 1 (at Services 102 and 96) at [s 558.5]–[s 558.35].) In this respect the texts reflect the case law in the Code States. 
     
      
    37 The submissions for the three applicants who advanced this argument should be rejected. 
     
      
    38 Mr Walker made two distinct submissions on behalf of all of the applicants on the issue of duplicity. The first was a submission asserting patent duplicity. The second was a submission based on what is often referred to as latent duplicity, to be discussed below. 
     
      
    39 Mr Walker’s patent duplicity submission directs attention to the form of the indictment which, as I have set out above, asserts an agreement “to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act (or acts)”. This pleading reflects s 101.6(2)(c), also set out above, which provides that the offence of doing “any act in preparation for … a terrorist act” is committed even if “the person’s act is done in preparation for … more than one terrorist act”. 
     
      
    40 Mr Walker adopted the submission made to Whealy J by counsel then appearing for some of the applicants to the effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is clearly a difference between entering into an agreement to do an act or acts in preparation for a single terrorist act and entering into an agreement to do an act or acts in preparation for more than one terrorist act. Those two agreements are not the same.” 
        
       
       
      And: 
       
       
        
        “… as the indictment stands, there are potentially two conspiracies alleged: one to do preparatory acts for a terrorist act, the other to do preparatory acts for terrorist acts.” 
        
       
      
    41 It is pertinent to note that this submission does not suggest that there is any element of duplicity in charging multiple preparatory acts. That is to say there is no objection to that part of the indictment which states: “Did conspire with each other … to do acts in preparation for”; rather, the focus of the submission is on the subsequent words “a terrorist act (or acts)”. 
     
      
    42 For the reasons already set out with respect to Mr Waterstreet’s submissions it is permissible to charge a single conspiracy to commit multiple offences, relevantly multiple preparatory acts. Mr Walker did not submit otherwise. The issue is whether or not there is patent duplicity arising from the charge that these multiple preparatory acts were prepared for either a single terrorist act or multiple terrorist acts. 
     
      
    43 Whealy J was correct to conclude that, on the authority of his own judgment in R v Lodhi approved on appeal (R v Lodhi [2005] NSWSC 1377; (2005) 199 FLR 236 and Lodhi v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 121; (2006) 199 FLR 303), preparatory acts for terrorism may occur where the precise nature of a terrorist act has yet to be decided and whether or not it has been decided that there would be more than one such act. In my opinion, his Honour correctly rejected the submission made for the applicants before him for this reason.  
     
      
    44 I am reinforced in this conclusion by the structure of s 101.6. Subsection (1) creates the relevant offence as “any act in preparation for … a terrorist act”. Subsection (2) is not in terms part of the statement of the offence but identifies three matters the presence of which does not lead to the conclusion that the offence has not been committed. This is made clear in the formulation “even if”.45 The reasoning in Lodhi is of course reinforced by the express reference in s 101.6(2)(b) to the fact that the preparatory act does not have to be directed to a specific terrorist act. It is relevant to point out that, at the time of the challenge to the indictment in Lodhi, the section included only s 101.6(2)(a). Subparagraphs (b) and (c) commenced operation on 4 November 2005 when Sch 1 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 2005 (Cth) came into force. 
     
      
    46 The pleading to which objection is taken is based on s 101.6(2)(c) which must be understood in the light of s 101.6(2)(b), ie there does not have to be a “specific terrorist act”. It is readily apparent that if there does not have to be an identifiable terrorist act at all, it does not matter whether the offender or offenders has or have determined whether or not there should be one or more than one terrorist act. 
     
      
    47 The focus of the section is on the preparatory act or acts, to the plurality of which no complaint is made. An agreement to perform multiple preparatory acts does not, in my view, differ in substance or form if the preparatory acts are to be directed to one or more ultimate terrorist acts.  
     
      
    48 Issues of this character have long been resolved in the law of conspiracy. As Jordan CJ said with respect to the cognate crime of conspiracy to defraud: 
     
      
       
        
        “An agreement to cheat and defraud is an indictable conspiracy notwithstanding that the parties have not yet agreed upon the precise form of cheating to be used … nor upon who are to be victims … If, however, the conspiracy charged is an agreement to cheat certain persons then and there decided upon, the indictment should sufficiently identify those persons.” ( 
        Ongley  
        at 117, references omitted.) 
        
       
      
    49 The reference to terrorist act or acts in s 106.6 is equivalent to the reference to “one or more forbidden characteristics” within the analysis of duplicity of Bray CJ in Romeyko v Samuels (1972) 2 SASR 529 at 552; (1972) 19 FLR 322 at 345 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The true distinction, broadly speaking, it seems to me, is between a statute which penalises one or more acts, in which case two or more offences are created, and a statute which penalises one act if it possesses one or more forbidden characteristics. In the latter case there is only one offence, whether the act under consideration in fact possesses one or several of such characteristics. Of course, there will always be borderline cases and if it is clear that Parliament intended several offences to be committed if the act in question possesses more than one of the forbidden characteristics, that result will follow.”

      Salmon v Chute  
      (1994) 115 FLR 176 at 184–187. 
       
      
    50 After referring to this authority in Lodhi v The Queen, I said with respect to the expansive definition of “terrorist act”: 
     
      
       
        
        “[75] … the scope and nature of the legislative scheme, concerned as it is with terrorist acts, which recent experience suggests are likely to have all three effects at the same time, Parliament intended to create a single offence with one or more of the specified characteristics.” 
        
       
      
    51 The same analysis applies to reject the asserted difference between an agreement to commit one terrorist act and an agreement to commit more than one terrorist act. With respect to an offence under s 106.6 itself, or with respect to an agreement to commit such offences under s 11.5(1), there is no element of duplicity by pleading the statutory provision identifying “forbidden characteristics”, to use Bray CJ’s words. 
     
      
       
      Latent Ambiguity 
       
      
    52 On the authority of judgments in the High Court referred to above, (ie Johnson v Miller, S v The Queen and Walsh v Tattersall;  see also Stanton v Abernathy (1990) 19 NSWLR 656) this Court must proceed on the basis that latent ambiguity or latent duplicity falls within the concept of duplicity which, in an appropriate case, can lead to the quashing of an indictment. It is by no means clear what is the ratio of the recent High Court authorities. The judgments which doubt whether some of the matters discussed can be characterised as raising a “duplicity” issue at all, have force. This is itself suggested by the use of terminology such as “latent ambiguity” in preference for “latent duplicity”. (See eg Stanton v Abernathy at 669G.) 
     
      
    53 Latent ambiguity can be identified when an indictment does not suggest duplicity on its face, but the way in which the Crown case is to be, or has been, conducted can be seen to subject the accused to the possibility of being convicted of one of a number of distinct offences. In the context of a charge of conspiracy this principle involves the exposure of an accused to being convicted of more than one conspiracy. 
     
      
    54 As Jordan CJ put it in Ongley at 117: 
     
      
       
        
        “A count in conspiracy must comply with the general rule of charging one offence only … The jury … cannot find some of the accused guilty of a conspiracy to effect only some of the improper purposes and other of the accused guilty only of a conspiracy to effect only other of the improper purposes; because to do so would be to find the existence of two conspiracies under a count which charges one only; and this, the law does not allow”. 
        
       
      
    55 Ongley was a case in which the indictment was not duplicitous but the trial judge’s directions to the jury permitted it to find more than one conspiracy, which was impermissible. 
     
      
    56 In the light of the express provision found in s 11.5(6) authorising the Court to dismiss a charge of conspiracy on the basis “that the interests of justice require it to do so”, it is difficult to identify any separate role for the principle of latent ambiguity with respect to a charge of conspiracy under the Code. As I have noted above, there is no appeal from his Honour’s rejection of the applicants’ case under s 11.5(6). Nevertheless, no submission has been made to this Court that s 11.5(6) provides exhaustively for these matters.  
     
      
    57 Duplicity is a reasonably clear concept, even in its latent form. It is not clear why it should be deployed as a label that covers principles — like the principle of a fair trial — which would have independent operation to the same effect. However, in the reasoning of recent majority judgments in the High Court, the law with respect to duplicity has been stated to serve a number of purposes of which the principle of a fair trial is one. (See eg S v The Queen esp at 284–286.)  
     
      
    58 The applicants’ submissions on latent duplicity could all arise under s 11.5(6) of the Code. For present purposes, the relevant findings of fact with respect to this aspect of the applicants’ submissions were made by Whealy J in the context of dealing with the s 11.5(6) issue agitated before him. 
     
      
    59 Mr Walker stated that his clients came to this Court for the sole purpose of having the present indictment quashed. That would be a rare order even in a case where some form of latent duplicity had been identified. As Kirby J said in Walsh v Tattersall at 110 (references omitted): 
     
      
       
        
        “A finding that the rule against duplicitous charges has been breached does not oblige the court, coming to that conclusion, to dismiss the charge. Where the defect is one of patent duplicity, the proper course is to put the complainant to an election to remove the embarrassment. Where the defect is latent and the particulars do not remove it, the court may direct further particulars; require the complainant to elect and to identify the alleged offences; and/or exercise the power to permit an amendment. If the latent defect, once exposed, suggests a risk that the accused might not have a fair trial on the charges as pleaded, the court should require correction.” 
        
       
      
    60 In R v Mitchell [1971] VR 46 the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria dealt with a submission that it was possible on the evidence in that case that the jury might find more than one conspiracy on a single count of conspiracy. Their Honours said at 57: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is not an argument which goes to the initial validity of the presentment. Such a development creates a situation with which the trial judge must deal.”  
        
       
      
    61 That the appropriate step upon finding even latent duplicity is to put the prosecutor to an election or to provide particulars or to require appropriate directions has long been the position. (See eg Johnson v Miller at 489–490; Stanton v Abernathy at 670–671.) 
     
      
    62 None of the applicants came before this Court seeking an order in the nature of requiring an election, nor for a stay by reason of inability to provide a fair trial. The sole order sought in this regard is an order to quash the indictment. On the latent duplicity argument, this was said to be based on the alleged impossibility, in view of the complexity of the matters that fall to be determined, of remedying the alleged defects in any manner, whether by means of election or particulars or directions.  
     
      
    63 In the present case, it is difficult to adopt the usual approach because of the considerable extension of matters which some of the majority judgments in S v The Queen and Walsh v Tattersall suggest come under the law of duplicity. The case of latent duplicity advanced on the part of the applicants in this case — or “multiplicity”, as Mr Walker put it — could be appropriately characterised as invoking the principle of a fair trial, for which remedies directed to avoiding an abuse of process or a dismissal under s 11.5(6) are more appropriate. Nevertheless, on High Court authority, the duplicity label can be applied. 
     
      
    64 Mr Walker did not submit that an analysis of the Crown Case Statement indicated that, as a matter of substance, the Crown should be seen as relying upon more than one agreement. Rather, his submission was that, from the perspective of the jury decision-making process or from the perspective of each individual accused in preparing for and conducting the trial, the nature and complexity of the issues raised is such that the possibility of multiple conspiracies will permeate the proceedings. Furthermore, that will occur in a manner not capable of rectification by directions on the part of the trial judge. 
     
      
    65 The submissions made in this respect could be depicted in the form of a tree diagram commencing with one agreement, which branches out into nine accused, which each branch out into overlapping preparatory acts and which in turn, theoretically, branch out into a variety of possible terrorist acts. It is this multiplicity, by creating an extraordinary range of possible permutations, which enables any person, whether an accused preparing for trial or a juror making a decision, to follow one of the multifarious paths along the tree diagram.  
     
      
    66 Mr Walker accepted that it was the nature of the conspiracy charged that there would be various permutations. To give only one example, it has long been accepted that it is not necessary that all conspirators joined the conspiracy at the same time, nor that they participated in the same way or to the same extent. Nevertheless, Mr Walker submitted that, on the Crown Case Statement in the present proceedings, the scope and range of the permutations was so extraordinary as to justify a conclusion of latent ambiguity or latent duplicity of a character which could not be remedied in the course of the trial. 
     
      
    67 A number of Whealy J’s factual findings are pertinent to resolving this issue. In his judgment of 18 March 2008 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[36] … First, the Crown Case statement is, in general terms, a statement of the evidence it is proposed to adduce in the trial. It is however, very detailed. It is a document that contains some 181 pages of very precise detail. There are approximately 400 paragraphs and over 700 detailed footnotes. I have had the advantage of reading carefully the whole of the Crown Case Statement. In addition I have read and examined carefully the list of the alleged overt acts. I am, of course, conscious that there are already a considerable number of applications to rule certain of the material in the Crown Case Statement inadmissible either generally or against particular accused. I am also aware that there are applications to exclude material from the trial on the basis that it will prove overly prejudicial to one or more of the accused. These various applications have not been argued at this stage an their determination is for the future. For the purposes of the present application, I will in general terms regard the evidence as admissible even though at a later stage some of it may be rejected or excluded.” 
        
       
      
    68 His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[66] … First, I do not consider the conspiracy is vague or amorphous. It is precisely enough expressed. The nine accused, it is said, entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act or terrorist acts. This involved equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to prepare for or plan a terrorist act or acts. In furtherance of the agreement, there were attempts to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials, which could be used in the construction of an explosive device; the obtaining (or attempted obtaining) of weaponry and ammunition; and the collection of large amounts of extremist and instructional material. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [69] So, the Crown case is that in many areas, although an agreement had been reached and steps were now being taken pursuant to it, to acquire the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act, a number of the acts taken in furtherance of the conspiracy were thwarted either by accurate surveillance police intervention or caution on the part of the conspirators themselves for fear of being detected. There is, however, no uncertainty in relation to the actions alleged to have been taken by each of the conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy. The uncertainty remains, as it often will with an offence under s 101.6, in that it is unclear as to whether a specific target or targets had been finally selected for the purposes of carrying out any terrorist attack. No decision had finally been made as to whether there would be one attack; or more than one attack. In my opinion, this does not mean that the conspiracy itself is either amorphous or vague. Indeed, the conspiracy is not only precisely stated in the Crown Case Statement, it is clear and simple. Yes, there is the point made by Mr Lange that it is unclear as to whether one terrorist act was contemplated or more than one; and, it is indeed [sic] it may well be that the ultimate target or targets have not been finally selected. But, as I say, the agreement itself is simple enough and easy to perceive and understand. 
        
       
       
        
        [70] … The directions that would be needed to be given to a jury in a conspiracy case are, no doubt, extensive. But I do not see them as being complicated to the point of making it difficult for the jury to follow. This would be especially so when the court will have the assistance of an experienced Crown team and very experienced lawyers appearing for each of the nine accused. 
        
       
       
        
        [71] I do not see this as a complex trial, at least not in the way in which that expression is usually used. Of course, it is very detailed and there are a considerable number of facts to be proved in the Crown case. But they are not complex facts and they may readily be appreciated by a jury. … One purpose of the present range of extensive pre-trial applications is to clear the landscape of inadmissible material and of material that should be excluded under, for example, ss 135 and 137 of the  
        Evidence Act.  
        It is to narrow and focus the issues. It is to streamline the jury’s task. The detailed preparation for the trial, and the anticipated co-operation of counsel in narrowing factual issues, will assist in making the trial a tolerable one for the jury. I do not pretend that it will be easy for a jury. It will be a long trial, and one that will be complicated by the mass of material to be assimilated. But, I repeat, it is not complicated material; there is simply a great deal of it. 
        
       
       
        
        [72] I next turn to the issue of sentencing such of the accused as may be convicted. This is obviously a very hypothetical exercise at this stage. I consider, however, that once the overall criminality in the conspiracy is appreciated, it should be possible to accurately perceive and identify the level of association and involvement of any individual conspirator who may be convicted of the charge. The necessary distinctions as to the level of criminality will be able to be made. I have no doubt that, were any of the accused to be convicted, their counsel would be quick and astute to identify relevant points of distinction. I fail to see that there would be any real danger of falling into this error in assessing the penalty to be imposed on any individual convicted of the conspiracy charge. I see no reason why uncharged matters would be taken into account or why the principles of double jeopardy might, in some way, be infringed. The Court would be astute to avoid any such situation. Here, of course, there is only the one charge. There is no suggestion that there will be any later substantive offences charged against these men. 
        
       
       
        
        [73] Similarly, I do not think that there is any real risk of injustice of unfairness in that the individual case of some of the accused might be buried under the mass of material generally relating to the conspiracy. In proving the existence of the conspiracy, and in proving acts done in furtherance of that conspiracy, the Crown will be entitled to adduce evidence putting into context the activities of each of the accused. I do not accept, that properly instructed, the jury will be led into error in this way.” 
        
       
      
    69 In the light of these findings by his Honour, which are of a kind with which this Court is reluctant to intervene, the fears expressed in the submissions for the applicants in this regard should not be accepted. There may be numerous permutations, but it cannot be said that, at this stage of the proceedings, it is appropriate, let alone necessary, to conclude that the nature of the Crown case is such that multiple agreements need to be dealt with by the accused or may be found by the jury. 
     
      
    70 Specifically, in the light of his Honour’s clear assessment of the facts, this is not a case which falls within the apprehension expressed by Murphy J in Gerakiteys v The Queen at 323: 
     
      
       
        
        “Conspiracy must not be allowed to become so amorphous that it will create a real danger of concealed duplicity of charges, so that the accused may be convicted despite the lack of unanimity among the jury members.” 
        
       
      
    71 No such amorphousness exists here. The complexity arises, not from the pleading, but from the scope, nature and extent of the conspiracy alleged and of the overt acts alleged to have been undertaken in pursuance of the single agreement. 
     
      
    72 I am reinforced in this conclusion by the forcefully expressed judgment of Whealy J, based on his Honour’s detailed assessment of the Crown case, that a conspiracy charge in the present case was the only way to properly reflect the criminality alleged in the Crown case against the accused (at [42], [57], [58], [63]). As his Honour put it: 
     
      
       
        
        “[57] … a substantive charge or charges … would not, however, have adequately revealed the wide-ranging, extensive and ongoing nature of the organisation. The reality of the Crown case, as I see it, is that it is only by means of the conspiracy charge that the full range[,] nature and scope of the agreement and the activities engaged in by the group, if the Crown case be accepted, can be revealed. The filing of individual charges against individual members of the organisation simply would fail to reflect and portray the real nature of what was going on.” 
        
       
      
    73 The implications of the submissions made on behalf of the applicants in this respect is that a conspiracy charge would rarely, if ever, be appropriate in the case of a conspiracy involving many co-conspirators to conduct numerous illegal acts over a long period of time. Our legal system must show itself capable, consistently with the requirements of procedural fairness, of handling cases of such complexity where a judgment is properly open that proceeding for individual substantive offences would not adequately reflect the criminality of the conduct. His Honour’s conclusion that that was the case here was not challenged on the appeal. This Court should not interfere with such a judgment made by an experienced trial judge, for articulated and supportable reasons. 
     
      
    74 Of significance for present purposes are the observations of Lord Diplock in Director of Public Prosecutions v Merriman [1973] AC 584, which have subsequently found favour in Australia, where his Lordship said at 607: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rule against duplicity, viz. that only one offence should be charged in any count of an indictment … has always been applied in a practical, rather in a strictly analytical, way for the purpose of determining what constituted one offence. Where a number of acts of a similar nature committed by one or more defendants were connected with one another, in the time and place of their commission or by their common purpose, in such a way that they could fairly be regarded as  
        forming part of the same  
        transaction or 
         criminal enterprise 
        , it was the practice, as early as the eighteenth century, to charge them in a single count of an indictment.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    75 A conspiracy, by reason of the focus on a single agreement, is the archetypical example of a charge of this character, ie where there is a single “criminal enterprise”. In this regard an important authority is the judgment of this Court in R v Hamzy (1994) 74 A Crim R 341, which is not inconsistent with the reasoning in the two majority judgments in Walsh v Tattersall. (See R v F (1996) 90 A Crim R 356 at 360–361; and R v Moussad [1999] NSWCCA 337; (1999) 152 FLR 373.)  
     
      
    76 In Hamzy Hunt CJ at CL set out and dealt with submissions raising a number of the different purposes served by the law of duplicity in the context of a case involving multiple occasions of supply of drugs. His Honour concluded at 348–349: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he Crown is entitled to plead in the one count a charge of supply where it intends to prove a number of individual acts of supply by the accused to different people and at different times,  
        provided that those acts can fairly and properly be identified as part of the same criminal enterprise  
        or the one criminal activity, but the trial court has power to direct the Crown either to elect or to separate the offences where the indictment would otherwise produce an unfairness to the accused. … 
        
       
       
        
        I see no reason why the concept of the  
        one criminal enterprise 
         or one criminal activity should be interpreted narrowly. Obviously enough, the fewer the number of individual acts, the fewer people and the shorter the period of time involved, the less likely that there could be any unfairness to the accused, but the issue of unfairness is dealt with separately from the issue as to whether the individual acts could fairly and properly be so identified. In the present case, it would have presented a totally unreal picture of the activities alleged against the appellant if anything less than the total picture had been presented to the jury. According to the evidence, the appellant was constantly involved  
        in the one criminal enterprise of dealing in heroin 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    77 In Moussad, which involved a charge of defrauding the Commonwealth by means of multiple dishonest claims for welfare payments, Smart AJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL and Bell J agreed, set out a careful review of the relevant authorities, including Hamzy and cases which have applied it. His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[54] The courts in this State have found that ‘enterprise’ counts have their place in drug supply and fraud cases where it is important to stress the overall criminality. … In order to bring home the full extent of their criminality and ensure appropriate punishment, the quantities from a number of acts of supply have to be aggregated. The enterprise is to supply large commercial quantities of heroin, cocaine or other harmful drugs.” 
        
       
      
    78 This reasoning is in accord with the reasoning of Whealy J in the present case. Hamzy and Moussad have subsequently been referred to with approval. (See eg R v ARD [2000] NSWCCA 443 esp at [159]–[163]; R v Orban [2005] NSWCCA 312 esp at [17]; R v Zampogna [2003] SASC 75; (2003) 85 SASR 56 esp at [28]; R v Lao and Nguyen [2002] VSCA 157; (2002) 5 VR 129; R v Ferguson (No 11) [2005] VSC 527;  (2005) 165 A Crim R 337 esp at [19], [24]; R v Poulier esp at [9]–[12].) 
     
      
    79 The conspiracy alleged in the present case is a quintessential example of a joint criminal enterprise. The complexities arise by reason of the scope and nature of the alleged conspiracy. On his Honour’s findings of fact set out above, reinforced by his judgment, which I accept, that the alleged criminality cannot be reflected in charges for substantive offences, the various purposes served by the law of duplicity have not been shown to be in jeopardy.  
     
      
    80 Leave to appeal on the ground of duplicity should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Consent 
       
      
    81 The three applicants who rely on this issue submit that his Honour erred in finding that, for purposes of s 11.5(8) of the Code, proceedings against the accused commenced upon the presentment of the indictment and each arraignment. 
     
      
    82 The facts relevant to the issue of consent are: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The three accused were arrested and charged on 8 November 2005; 
         
         
        (b) The court attendance notice was issued on 8 November 2005; 
         
         
        (c) An amended court attendance notice was dated on or before 23 January 2007 (but that notice was not attended before Whealy J); 
         
         
        (d) A written consent under s 11.5(8) to proceedings for an offence of conspiracy was signed by the then Director of Public Prosecutions on 28 February 2007; 
         
         
        (e) The committal proceedings commenced on 5 March 2007; 
         
         
        (f) The accused were committed to stand trial on 30 April 2007; 
         
         
        (g) The accused were arraigned before the Supreme Court on 31 May 2007; 
         
         
        (h) An indictment, in the same terms as the offence referred to in the DPP’s consent was presented at the arraignment and each accused pleaded not guilty to the charge in the indictment. 
        
       
      
    83 The three applicants rely upon the fact that the Court Attendance Notice was issued prior to the consent. They submit that this constituted the relevant commencement of proceedings. Section 53 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “53(1) All proceedings are taken to have commenced on the date on which a court attendance notice is filed in the registry of a relevant court in accordance with this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Nothing in this section affects any other act or law under which proceedings are taken to have commenced on another date.” 
        
       
      
    84 The issue before the Court turns on the interpretation of the words “proceedings … commenced” in s 11.5(8) of the Code. In my opinion, the interpretation of this Commonwealth statute is not determined by s 53 of the State Act which is, in terms, a deeming provision — “are taken” — of a definitional character.  
     
      
    85 Section 68(1) of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth) provides, relevantly, for the application to Commonwealth offences of: “The laws of a State … respecting … the procedure for … their … commitment for trial on indictment; and … their trial and conviction on indictment”. Section 79 of the Judiciary Act does not relevantly add anything for present purposes. 
     
      
    86 The provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act requiring and regulating court attendance notices are laws “respecting procedure”. Section 53 appears to me to be of a different character. No doubt s 53 will be picked up and applied by s 68(1) if another section of the Criminal Procedure Act, which is itself procedural, refers to the time of commencement. That, however, does not require the characterisation of s 53 as procedural for purposes of the Judiciary Act. It remains definitional, rather than procedural. Nor does it require that the words ‘commence proceedings’ in a Commonwealth statute bear that meaning. Such a statute must be interpreted in its own context. 
     
      
    87 Significantly s 11.5(8) states, by way of express qualification, that a person may be “remanded in custody” before any consent is issued. An accused cannot be “remanded in custody” except by a court. This is the natural and ordinary meaning of the word “remand” and is reflected in statutes eg s 15 of the Crimes Act 1914. On this analysis “proceedings” do not “commence” for purposes of s 11.5(8) at the time of issue of a court attendance notice. Plainly, s 11.5(8) requires a consent before the actual start of a committal hearing, where there is a committal. It does not, in my opinion, need to exist before the step which first invokes the jurisdiction of the local court. The consent in the present case was extant before the committal hearing. 
     
      
    88 This analysis disposes of this proposed ground of appeal. It is, however, appropriate to deal with the alternative bases upon which submissions have been made. 
     
      
    89 In his judgment of 19 March 2008 Whealy J held that s 53, in its context, deals only with a court attendance notice for committal proceedings and not generally. His Honour referred specifically to s 47(1), s 48, s 49(1) and s 53 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    90 His Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[17] But more critically, it seems to me that the real issue confronting this Court is whether the present indictment should be quashed on the basis that the proceedings on indictment are themselves a nullity. To my mind, this issue will not be determined by examining whether the committal proceedings were irregular or invalid, based on the absence of a consent at the time the committal proceedings were taken to have commenced or earlier. I shall explain why this is so. First, although Chapter 3 of the CPA deals with indictable procedure, s 53 appears in Division 1 of Part 2 of the Chapter. It is, as I have said, a division dealing with the commencement of committal proceedings and other matters relating to committal proceedings. This is made clear by the headings and context of the sections I have mentioned. Secondly, this Court’s jurisdiction to deal with criminal proceedings has been the subject of recent decisions in the News South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
        
       
      
    91 His Honour referred to R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; (2005) 64 NSWLR 10; R v Taylor [2003] NSWCCA 194. 
     
      
    92 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[27] These decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal make it clear that criminal proceedings in this Court are commenced as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused is arraigned on the indictment. Proceedings on indictment are not commenced at any earlier date. 
        
       
       
        
        [28] Accordingly, it is clear that the Director’s consent was given well before the commencement of the proceedings on indictment in this Court. For that reason, [i]t cannot be said that these present proceedings lack jurisdiction or are a nullity. 
        
       
       
        
        [29] This must be so, even if it be correct that irregularity or invalidity touched upon the committal proceedings due to the alleged lateness of the giving of consent. 
        
       
       
        
        [30] It is clear that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has power to proceed upon an ex officio indictment even where there has been a discharge at committal. This power also extends to a situation where there has been no committal (see s 47(4) of CPA; and section 6(2D) of the  
        Director of Public Prosecutions Act  
        1983 (Cth); see also  
        R v Duffield; R v Dellpatrona  
        (1992) 28 NSWLR 6[3]8;  
        R v Butler  
        (1991) 24 NSWLR at 66;  
        R v Hull  
        (1989) 16 NSWLR 385). It must also extend to the situation where a committal is found to be irregular, defective or wanting in validity.” 
        
       
      
    93 I agree with his Honour’s analysis of Pt 2 Ch 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Chapter 3 is entitled “Indictable Procedure” and Pt 2 is entitled “Committal Proceedings”. Division 1 of Pt 2, in which s 53 appears, is entitled “Commencement of Proceedings”. The first section in that Division provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “47(1) Committal proceedings for an offence are to be commenced by the issue and filing of a court attendance notice in accordance with this Division.” 
        
       
      
    94 Section 48 and s 49(1), to which Whealy J also referred, both include a reference to the phrase “commence committal proceedings”.  
     
      
    95 In my opinion, Whealy J was correct to confine the word “proceedings” in s 53 to committal proceedings. This conclusion is particularly clear in the context of the legislative scheme which contains, in Pt 2 Div 1, detailed regulation for procedures in lower courts for summary offences and which includes, in s 172(1) and s 178, precisely equivalent provisions expressed in identical terms to s 47(1) and s 53 but referrable to summary proceedings. 
     
      
    96 The absence of any direct impingement upon the presentation of an indictment is also made clear by the terms of s 53(3) itself which states that nothing in s 53(1) affects “any … law in which proceedings are taken to have commenced on another date”. The common law with respect to the presentation of indictments falls within this qualification. Furthermore, s 47(4) provides: “Nothing in this Part affects any law or practice relating to indictments presented or filed in the Supreme Court …”.  
     
      
    97 I agree with Whealy J that there was a consent extant prior to the “commencement of proceedings” in the Supreme Court. The result is the same as that reached on a comparable consent requirement in Victorian legislation. (See R v Evans [1964] VR 717.) 
     
      
    98 The three applicants raise an issue as to whether any irregularity or invalidity of the committal proceedings, by reason of the fact that they were “commenced” within the meaning of s 11.5(8) of the Code without an extant consent, affects the indictment. They submit that invalidity of the committal proceedings in turn invalidates the indictment where the statutory provisions for an ex officio indictment were not followed. 
     
      
    99 Whealy J considered a Crown submission to the effect that, even if the issue of the Court Attendance Notice constituted the “commencement of proceedings” within the meaning of s 11.5(8), that would not have the effect of invalidating the indictment. The Crown relied, in this respect, on the analysis in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 193 CLR 355 at 69–70. His Honour expressed doubt about this submission, particularly in the context of a statutory requirement that “proceedings … must not be commenced”, but did not find it necessary to resolve the issue. His Honour, nevertheless, concluded that he was satisfied that the “present criminal proceedings”, ie those instituted by way of the presentation of the indictment in the Supreme Court, were validly issued after the consent. 
     
      
    100 Like Whealy J, I do not find it necessary to express a final view on this issue. I note that, even in a criminal context, the effect of a procedural irregularity upon the validity of subsequent steps, does require analysis of the statutory scheme. The fact of the criminal context is an important, but not necessarily conclusive, element in such an analysis. (See eg Janceski at [90]–[98], [223]–[283].) The nature of the irregularity identified here — where the consent was issued after the court attendance notice, but before the actual committal proceedings — may have resulted in a technically invalid committal. On the authorities referred to by Whealy J (eg R v Butler (1991) 24 NSWLR 66), such an irregularity does not necessarily invalidate the subsequent proceedings on the indictment. 
     
      
    101 Leave to appeal on this ground should be refused. 
     
      
       
      Offence Unknown to the Law 
       
      
    102 The submission made on behalf of the three applicants who advance this contention is based on the fact that the offence of conspiracy in s 11.5 of the Code applies to all offences under the Code, by force of s 2.2 of the Code. That, it is submitted, would lead to absurd consequences in the case of those offences which are in themselves expressed in terms of conspiring to do some act such as conspiracy to defraud (s 135.4) or conspiracy to bring a false accusation (s 41 of the Crimes Act 1914) or conspiracy to defeat justice (s 42 of the Crimes Act 1914). 
     
      
    103 There is authority to support the proposition that a conspiracy to commit an offence, which is itself expressed in terms of an agreement to do something, is absurd. (See R v Chow (1987) 11 NSWLR 561.) However, that conclusion does not extend beyond that circumstance, eg to a charge of conspiracy to supply a third person. (See R v Challita (1988) 37 A Crim R 175 esp at 184; Trudgeon v R (1988) 39 A Crim R 252 esp at 253; R v Carusi (1989) 17 NSWLR 516; R v Deng (1996) 91 A Crim R 80 esp at 90.) 
     
      
    104 No such provision is involved in the present case. The applicants seek to apply Chow by analogy and submit that, where the agreement is itself capable of constituting the substantive offence, a similar absurdity arises. In this case, the substantive offence involves “acts in preparation for a terrorist act”. An agreement to commit such an act could itself be such a ‘preparatory’ act. 
     
      
    105 This may be so. However, it does not involve the kind of absurdity found to exist in an “agreement to agree” charge. The Court said in Chow at 570: “the agreement to sell or supply, being the substantive offence cannot also be the agreement which brings into existence the conspiracy”. 
     
      
    106 Nothing like that exists here. There is no absurdity of the character identified in Chow. It is often the case that the overt acts of a conspiracy are themselves substantive offences. Nevertheless, it has long been recognised that a charge of conspiracy may be more appropriate than charging the substantive offences. Similarly, a charge of conspiracy to commit preparatory acts may be more appropriate than charging the agreement as the preparatory act or one of the preparatory acts. Indeed, that is what Whealy J decided when rejecting the application for the charge to be dismissed under s 11.5(6). 
     
      
    107 Leave to appeal on this ground should be refused.

     KEVIN PETER WRIGHT v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against an order made on 22 March 1994 by Mitchelmore DCJ (the sentencing judge) cancelling an earlier order made by Nader DCJ sentencing him to a period of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention. The complaint is that the sentencing judge failed to set a non-parole period. The applicant also seeks leave to appeal out of time. 
     
      
    2 On 16 August 1993 the applicant pleaded not guilty to a charge of robbery whilst being armed with an offensive weapon at Rozelle on 26 July 1990. On the second day of the trial the applicant changed his plea to guilty. 
     
      
    3 On 23 September 1993 the applicant was sentenced by Nader DCJ to imprisonment for a period of 2 years and 32 weeks to be served by way of periodic detention. The sentence was to commence on 1 October 2003. 
     
      
    4 The applicant did not complete the sentence of periodic detention and on 3 February 1994 an application was filed by an officer of the Department of Corrective Services for the cancellation of the order for periodic detention. 
     
      
    5 That application was granted despite the fact that the applicant was not present. The sentencing judge ordered that the unexpired portion of the term of periodic detention (namely a period of 127 weeks) was to be served by way of full-time custody. 
     
      
    6 The remarks of the sentencing judge were never taken out although there is a note on the file kept in the District Court registry indicating that the sentencing judge declined to set a minimum term and an additional term. There is no indication as to why his Honour declined to do so. 
     
      
    7 A warrant for the apprehension of the applicant was issued but it was not until 2 February 2007 that he was arrested. He has been in custody since that date and the sentence, we were informed, will expire on 9 July 2009. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was 29 at the time of the offence and 32 at the time he was sentenced. He is now 47. He had a very minor record which consisted of offences in the Children’s Court in 1978 in respect of which he was admonished and discharged. The only other matters related to a mid-range PCA offence and driving whilst unlicensed for which he was dealt with in the Local Court in 1990. 
     
      
    9 The applicant spent 3 months in custody before receiving the sentence of periodic detention. A number of psychiatric reports were in evidence which revealed that the applicant had been diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia and depression. The reports contained recommendations that the applicant’s condition be reviewed on a regular basis and that he receive on-going treatment. Whilst on remand he had made a suicide attempt.  
     
      
    10 In R v Sayin [2003] NSWCCA 384, Smart AJ, with whom Wood CJ at CL agreed, observed: 
     
      
       
        
        This Court has held that there is no appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the order of a District Court judge cancelling a periodic detention order (Wilson v Department of Corrective Services (1997) 93 A Crim R 301 at 306 and 309). At 309 this court followed the earlier decision in Sommerville  
        (1995) 36 NSW LR 184 
         that because s 27(1)(c) of the Act deems the unexpired portion of the original sentence to be a separate term of imprisonment imposed at the time of the cancellation, some limited appellate consequences flow. This court’s power is limited, in effect, to considering whether a non parole period should be set in respect of the sentence passed and its length. In Wilson the court discussed the difficulties, which arose when consequent upon a cancellation order the judge dealt with the offender when not present. It took the view that where an offender did not appear the court should issue a warrant for the arrest of the offender and bring him before the court. Otherwise the court does not have before it the necessary material to decide whether to set a non parole period and its length. (par 12) 
        
       
      
    11 In Sayin a periodic detention order which was made in 1994 was cancelled in 1995. This Court held that the sentencing judge had erred in proceeding in the absence of the offender. It also held that the sentencing judge had erred in not setting a non-parole period. In written submissions, the Crown observed that “as the circumstances in Sayin are almost identical to those in the present appeal” the Court may be prepared to find error. I am disposed to accept that submission.  
     
      
    12 A body of material has been placed before the Court concerning what has occurred since 1994. The applicant swore an affidavit in which he said that he had stopped attending periodic detention so that he could care for his brother who was very ill. The brother, who had been a transsexual, died in June 1994. Thereafter the applicant said that he moved in with his mother who lived in Dubbo. He lived with her until her death on 6 June 2004 and was her sole carer. The evidence discloses that she suffered from a number of serious illnesses during that time.  
     
      
    13 The material before the Court reveals that since 1994 the applicant has continued to receive treatment from a psychiatrist for various on-going problems relating to his mental health. During that period he has also completed various therapeutic psychological courses and workshops and received assistance from the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service.  
     
      
    14 The offence which the applicant committed in July 1990 is now very stale. Most, but not all of that delay is attributable to the applicant. Whilst the period of delay, in and of itself, does not enable the applicant to claim any significant amelioration of his sentence, he has nonetheless taken very significant steps towards his ultimate rehabilitation, a matter that can, and should, be taken into account in his favour. Nor is there anything to suggest that the applicant has done anything but live a law abiding existence during those years. He has certainly not come to the attention of the authorities. Moreover, he has conducted himself in a productive fashion since he has been returned to custody. He has been engaged in constant employment and has not been the subject of any misconduct charges. He has also completed a six week Drug and Alcohol course. As of today’s date he has served almost 64 weeks of the 127 week sentence. 
     
      
    15 In the light of the various matters to which I have adverted, I would make a finding of special circumstances. That will enable the applicant to continue receiving community based assistance with issues surrounding his mental health. 
     
      
    16 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1 Grant leave for an extension of time within which to bring this application. 
       
       
      2 Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      3 Allow the appeal (in part). 
       
       
      4 Set a non-parole of 18 months to commence on 2 February 2007 and to expire on 1 August 2008 on which date the applicant is to be released on parole. 
       
       
      5 Confirm the head sentence of 127 weeks to expire on 9 July 2009. 
       
      
    17 BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by his Honour and also His Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    18 BARR J: I also agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: The applicant, who is aged 58 years, was convicted in 2003 of offences relating to his possession of child pornography. For these offences he was sentenced to an overall term of two years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year to date from 5 September 2003. At the time of his arrest he was employed as a music teacher at a private school for girls. His arrest and subsequent conviction attracted publicity. As the result of this publicity three complainants, MCL, PP and SP, came forward and reported to the police that each had been sexually molested by the applicant as a child. The investigation of these complaints led the police to re-open an inquiry into a complaint made by LS in 1986 that he had been sexually molested by the applicant. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was arrested and charged with offences against MCL, PP, SP and LS on 4 September 2004, which was the day on which he was due to be released on parole. He was refused bail and he has been in custody continuously since 5 September 2003.  
     
      
    3 On 12 July 2006 the applicant pleaded guilty to 12 counts in an indictment; which charged six offences against MCL, between December 1982 and December 1983; four offences against PP, between January 1985 and July 1987; one offence against LS, between 25 March and 10 April 1986 and one offence against SP, between 26 October 1987 and 26 October 1990. The complainants were aged between 11 and 14 years at the date of the offences. The applicant asked the Judge to take into account a further 12 offences on a Form One under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (the Sentencing Procedure Act) in sentencing him for the offence charged in count eight.  
     
      
    4 On 14 November 2006, the applicant was sentenced by JX Gibson ADCJ to sentences to date from 4 September 2004, which in the aggregate amounted to 16 years and 11 months with an effective non-parole period of 12 years and 11 months. The first date on which the applicant will be eligible for consideration of release on parole is 3 August 2017. The last sentence will expire on 3 August 2021. 
     
      
    5 The applicant appeals against the severity of the individual sentences and the aggregate sentence.  
     
      
    6 Each of the counts in the indictment charged an offence under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). Some of the offences have since been repealed. A brief description of the offence, the maximum penalty provided for it, the particulars, and the sentence imposed for it are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count one 
         
        Between 1 December 1982 and 31 December 1983 – indecent assault, s 81, maximum penalty five years’ imprisonment.  
         
        The applicant fondled MCL’s penis. MCL was aged 11 – 12 years. 
         
        Sentenced to imprisonment for two years and eight months with a non-parole period of two years to date from 4 December 2006.

        Procure the commission of an act of indecency, s 81A, maximum penalty two years’ imprisonment.  
         
        The applicant procured MCL to fondle his (the applicant’s) penis. MCL was aged 11 – 12 years.  
         
        Sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 4 September 2004.

        Indecent assault, s 81, maximum penalty five years’ imprisonment.  
         
        The applicant sucked MCL’s penis. MCL was aged 11 – 12 years.  
         
        Sentenced to three years and four months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months to date from 4 August 2007.

        The applicant procured MCL to suck his (the applicant’s) penis. MCL was aged 11 – 12 years.  
         
        Sentenced to 21 months’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months to date from 4 March 2005.  
        
       
       
        
        Count five

        Count six

    7 The 12 offences taken into account on the Form One comprised four further sexual offences committed against MCL between 1 December 1982 and 31 December 1983: fondling MCL’s penis, procuring MCL to fondle the applicant’s penis; sucking MCL’s penis and procuring MCL to suck his (the applicant’s) penis. Five offences committed against PP between January 1985 and July 1987: fondling PP’s penis (x 2); rubbing his penis between PP’s legs; attempting penile penetration of PP’s anus; putting his penis inside PP’s mouth. Two offences committed against LS between March and April 1986: rubbing his penis between LS’s buttocks and against LS’s anus.  
     
      
    8 The twelfth offence on the Form One related to the procurement of a woman named Lynne Horman to give a false statement under oath, the making of which amounted to perjury, at committal proceedings which were held in 1986 arising out of the complaint made by LS that the applicant had sexually assaulted him.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    9 A statement of agreed facts was tendered at the sentence hearing. It is convenient to refer to the factual background by reference to the agreed statement.  
     
      
    10 Counts one to six in the indictment (and offences one to four in the Form One) related to MCL.  
     
      
    11 MCL met the applicant at a YMCA camp held in the Christmas school holidays. The applicant was one of the camp leaders. At the end of the camp the applicant told MCL that he could stay with him whenever he wished. MCL’s parents had separated and he was living with his mother and younger brother. Shortly after the camp the applicant spoke by telephone with MCL’s mother telling her that he was a music teacher at the Pittwater Grammar School and that he had been one of MCL’s camp leaders. He offered to take MCL on an outing. Following this MCL visited the applicant at his home. Nothing of a sexual nature occurred on this occasion. MCL had an interest in music and the applicant showed him his grand piano and the two of them watched videos and ate chocolates.  
     
      
    12 The following weekend the applicant collected MCL from his home and took him to a tennis class. That night while the two watched a movie the applicant began to fondle MCL’s penis (count one) and MCL fondled the applicant’s penis (count two). The applicant dropped MCL to his home the following day with a promise of taking him on a further outing.  
     
      
    13 On the next visit the applicant gave MCL a piano lesson. After this they watched videos and mutual fondling took place (the first and second offences on the Form One). The applicant then removed MCL’s pants, asking if he could suck MCL’s penis. The applicant sucked MCL’s penis (count three). MCL sucked the applicant’s penis at the applicant’s request (count four). A short time after this the two had a bath together and mutual fellatio took place (counts five and six).  
     
      
    14 During the visits to the applicant’s home and in the course of telephone calls MCL spoke to the applicant about his distress arising out of his parents’ divorce.  
     
      
    15 After further overnight stays at the applicant’s home, the applicant invited MCL to accompany him on a trip to Katoomba. They stayed together at a motel and mutual fellatio took place (offences three and four on the Form One).  
     
      
    16 The trip to Katoomba was the last occasion of sexual contact that MCL recalled. Soon after this he severed contact with the applicant because he became aware that the conduct was “bad”.  
     
      
    17 Counts seven to 10 in the indictment (and offences five to nine in the Form One) related to PP.  
     
      
    18 When PP was a young boy his parents separated and he and his brother, SP, the third complainant, were made wards of the State and placed in a boys’ home. Ultimately the two were placed in a boys’ home.  
     
      
    19 The applicant offered to take boys from this Boys’ home on outings in his capacity as a “special friend”. In early 1985 PP and another lad decided to run away from the Boys’ home. They went to the applicant’s home. The applicant told PP that if he behaved himself at the Boys’ home and attended school he would take him on outings. He gave PP a tour of his home, pointing out his collection of computer games and showing him a cupboard containing confectionary. Later that day the applicant returned the two boys to the Boys’ home.  
     
      
    20 The next weekend the applicant took PP and the other boy out for the first time. They watched videos. After this the applicant said that he had a “special movie”. He played a suggestive movie after which he told PP that he could sleep with him in his single bed. Once in bed the applicant embraced PP, rubbing PP’s penis (offence five on the Form One). The applicant pushed PP’s head down onto his penis, placing it in PP’s mouth (count seven). After this the applicant reached for some cream and rubbed it around PP’s scrotum, telling him that it was okay. He then commenced to push his penis into PP’s anus, which caused a degree of pain (count 8). PP told the applicant that it was hurting him, and the applicant withdrew and began rubbing his penis between PP’s buttocks, telling him that what they were doing was secret (offence six on the Form One).  
     
      
    21 Later that year staff at the Boys’ home took steps to restrict the contact between PP and the applicant. However PP, who disliked the strictness and discipline of the Boys’ home and who enjoyed the attention and gifts that he received from the applicant, skipped school from time to time and visited the applicant. On one occasion the applicant took PP to a nudist camp. During the visit he fondled PP’s penis while they were swimming naked in a dam (offence seven on the Form One). After this the applicant took PP to the shower block and rubbed soap around PP’s anus and attempted to penetrate him with his penis (offence eight on the Form One).  
     
      
    22 The applicant arranged to see PP on his fourteenth birthday. They purchased take-away food and went to the applicant’s home. After dinner the applicant gave PP a watch and a Rambo-style hunting knife. They played a videogame and after this the applicant sucked PP’s penis (count nine) and had anal intercourse with PP (count 10). The following day the applicant drove PP back to the Boys’ home, dropping him a few blocks from the entrance. On the way he stopped the car near the Lane Cove National Park and put his penis in PP’s mouth (offence nine on the Form One).  
     
      
    23 Contact between the applicant and PP continued for another few years, during which time PP was either living in a State home or with the applicant.  
     
      
    24 Count 11 in the indictment (and offences 10 and 11 on the Form One) related to the complainant LS.  
     
      
    25 LS was aged 14 when he met the applicant. This was in April 1986. LS’s parents were separated and he was living with his mother. LS had met another youth, RF, in Kings Cross. RF invited LS to stay with him at the applicant’s home. They spent time there playing videogames and watching videos. They slept on a mattress on the floor beside the applicant’s bed. After a few days RF left. The applicant told LS that he was welcome to stay, which he did. That night LS asked the applicant if he could sleep in his bed as he had a sore back. The applicant agreed and LS got into the applicant’s bed. The applicant encouraged LS to remove his nightwear. He commenced rubbing his penis between LS’s buttocks (offence 10 on the Form One) after which he sucked LS’s penis (count 11). When LS woke the next morning he felt the applicant rubbing his penis between his buttocks (offence 11 on the Form One). LS was due to return to his mother’s home. The applicant offered to drive him and on the way they stopped at a shopping centre and the applicant arranged to have his name and telephone number engraved on the back of LS’s watch.  
     
      
    26 A few days after these events LS complained to his father and the police were informed of the matter. The applicant was charged with sexual offences against LS. Later that year LS gave evidence at a committal hearing. At the close of the prosecution case the applicant made a statement. A number of character witnesses were called on his behalf, including Lynne Horman. Ms Horman testified that she was the applicant’s fiancée and that they shared a normal sexual relationship and that she had never seen the applicant making homosexual advances to anyone.  
     
      
    27 The applicant was committed for trial. Subsequently a decision was made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to discontinue the proceedings. The Director’s reasons for this decision did not relate to any unwillingness on the part of LS to give evidence.  
     
      
    28 On 19 January 2005 Ms Horman was given an undertaking by the Attorney General that she would not be prosecuted for perjury if she gave evidence in any criminal proceedings against the applicant. She informed the police that she had met the applicant in 1978 or 1979 at a tennis club. She had stayed at his home on occasions, sleeping on the lounge. The applicant often had a boy staying with him. The boy would sleep on an air mattress in his bedroom. She had not seen any sexual misbehaviour. Prior to the committal hearing of the charges involving LS the applicant had told her that he needed her to give evidence to the effect that they were engaged and that they enjoyed a normal sexual relationship.  
     
      
    29 Count 12 related to the allegation made by SP, PP’s brother. SP met the applicant at the same time as his brother. SP visited the applicant’s home on a number of occasions when sexual activity took place. SP said that at times the applicant videorecorded the activity. When the applicant was charged in 2002 with child pornography offences the police identified SP as one of the persons depicted in a videorecording. The footage shows (albeit briefly) a naked adult male groaning while embracing SP and rubbing up against SP’s backside. The incident occurred when SP was aged approximately 14 years.  
     
      
    30 The applicant pleaded guilty to the offences on 12 July 2006. He had been committed for trial and the trial had been fixed to commence on 10 July 2006. In the intervening two days discussions took place between the Crown and the applicant’s legal representatives as to an agreed statement of facts. The Judge assessed the utilitarian value of the pleas as justifying a discount of 10 per cent.  
     
      
    31 The Judge found that the applicant had targeted boys who were vulnerable because of their family circumstances. He concluded that the conduct was planned. The applicant was in a relationship of trust to each of the complainants (save for LS). His Honour found that there was no reason to find special circumstances other than by reason of the accumulation of the sentences.  
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    32 It is convenient to deal with grounds 6, 7 and 8 together at the outset: 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 – His Honour erred by failing to find special circumstances other than to deal with the accumulation of sentences.  
       
       
      Ground 7 – The individual sentences and the total effective sentence is manifestly excessive.  
       
       
      Ground 8 – His Honour erred in the manner in which he accumulated sentences and by failing to give proper effect to the principle of totality.  
       
      
    33 Central to the challenge made to individual sentences and to the aggregate sentence is that the Judge was required to sentence the applicant by reference to the pattern of sentencing for offences of this character that applied at the time the offences were committed: R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368. Particular attention was directed to recent decisions of this Court concerning the approach to the specification of the non-parole period in cases in which the offences were committed prior to the introduction of the Sentencing Act 1989 (NSW): (AJB v R [2007] NSWCCA 51 and MJL v R [2007] NSWCCA 261).  
     
      
    34 In MJL Hidden J (with whose judgment Campbell JA agreed) said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “[24] The approach in MJR was developed further in  
        AJB v R  
        [2007] NSWCCA 51, a case involving sexual offences between 1979 and 1982, in which the Court had regard specifically to the practice at that time of setting non-parole periods: see the leading judgment of Howie J at [34] ff. Howie J noted that the specification of non-parole periods was then governed by the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966 which, unlike the current legislation, did not prescribe a prima facie proportion between non-parole period and head sentence. Such a statutory proportion was first introduced in the Sentencing Act 1989, which was repealed and replaced by the present Act.  
        
       
       
        
        [25] During the period with which that case was concerned, Howie J observed, a non-parole period was usually somewhere between a third and a half of the length of the sentence. His Honour concluded that that practice might itself be sufficient to constitute special circumstances justifying departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period under the present regime. Indeed, his Honour said at [37] that the Court in that case ‘should endeavour to apply the practice that existed in 1982 in specifying a non-parole period because that practice would favour the applicant.’ 
        
       
       
        
        [26] The decision in  
        AJB 
         was handed down after the applicant was sentenced. The Crown Prosecutor in this Court acknowledged the principle enunciated in that case, but sought to distinguish it on its facts. That applicant had made out a much more favourable subjective case than the present applicant. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that in this case an effective non-parole period lower than that which his Honour imposed would be inadequate to reflect considerations of retribution and deterrence. Of course, as Howie J noted in  
        AJB 
         at [38], it has long been the law that a non-parole period should serve that function.  
        
       
       
        
        [27] However, in my view, the approach taken in  
        AJB 
         is applicable here and justifies a finding of special circumstances, quite apart from other subjective features which might have done so.” 
        
       
      
    35 Smart AJ expressed his agreement with Hidden J in MJL that the earlier sentencing practice constituted special circumstances. His Honour referred to the judgment of the High Court in Deakin v R (1984) 54 ALJR 765 at 766: 
     
      
       
        
        “[45] …The intention of the legislature in providing for the fixing of minimum terms is to provide for mitigation of the punishment of the prisoner in favour of his rehabilitation through conditional freedom, when appropriate, once the prisoner has served the minimum time that a judge determines justice requires that he must serve having regard to all the circumstances of his offence: see  
        Power v R 
         (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 629. 
        
       
       
        
        [46] After the decision in  
        Power 
        , the judges of this State followed the High Court’s decision as to the principles to be applied in setting non-parole periods (or minimum terms). Generally, they set non-parole periods of half to one-third of the aggregate sentence as intimated in  
        AJB 
         but there were instances where longer non-parole periods were set.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [48] With sentencing under the 1966 Act, after  
        Power 
        , Courts, in practice tended to impose lengthy head sentences and, as mentioned, non-parole periods that varied from about one-third to one half of the head sentence or, where there was more than one sentence of the aggregate sentences. Prior to  
        Power  
        the non-parole periods were probably shorter. See  
        R v Portolesi 
         [1973] 1 NSWLR 105 at 107 and  
        R v Sloane 
         [1973] 1 NSWLR 203 at 206.” 
        
       
      
    36 In AJB the offences were committed between 1979 and 1982, which explains the discussion of the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966. That Act was repealed by the Probation and Parole Act 1983, which commenced on 27 February 1984. This was the Act which introduced the regime of automatic release on probation at the expiration of a non-probation period in cases in which a sentence of three years or less was imposed. The Probation and Parole (Serious Offenders) Amendment Act 1987, which commenced on 1 March 1988, introduced minimum non-parole periods for certain offences which were defined as “serious offences”. This was achieved by the introduction of s 20A, which mandated that the non-parole period for such offences be at least three-quarters of the length of the sentence. The Court was given a discretion to specify a shorter period, but only if it determined that the circumstances justified that course. For present purposes it is sufficient to note that while certain sexual offences (as specified in cl 4 of Sch 5) constituted a “serious offence” for the purposes of s 20A, none of the offences of which the applicant was convicted was a “serious offence”.  
     
      
    37 The Sentencing Act 1989 commenced on 25 September 1989. It introduced the requirement for the court in sentencing a person to a term of imprisonment to firstly specify a minimum term and then to set an additional term. Section 5(2) provided that the additional term must not exceed one-third of the minimum term, unless the court decided that there were special circumstances.  
     
      
    38 Mr Boulten SC, who with Mr Walsh appeared on the applicant’s behalf, took the Court to a number of decisions of this Court which were said to show the pattern of sentencing for similar offences. These were cases in which the offender was sentenced under the Sentencing Act 1989 but they concerned offences committed in the 1980s over a period broadly comparable to the period covered by these offences.  
     
      
    39 R v Bamford (unreported), Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 July 1991, was an appeal against the severity of sentences imposed in October 1990 on the offender’s plea of guilty to five offences involving sexual assaults upon his stepdaughter. The assaults were not isolated instances but formed part of a wider pattern of behaviour, which extended over a substantial period of time. The first offence took place between June 1986 and June 1987 and was of sexual intercourse with the complainant when she was under the age of 10 and under the offender’s authority. This was an offence under s 66A and was subject to a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. The second, third and fifth counts were offences under s 66C(2) involving sexual intercourse with the child when she was aged between 10 and 16 years and when she was under the authority of the offender. These offences took place in 1988 and 1989, when the child was aged between 10 and 12 years. The final count was an offence under s 66D involving attempted sexual intercourse with the child, when she was aged about 11. It was an ingredient of the offence that she was under the authority of the offender. This offence occurred in the early part of 1989. Each of these offences was subject to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Concurrent sentences were imposed for each of the offences. The offender’s overall criminality was reflected in the sentence on the first count, which was penal servitude for 12 years with a minimum term of nine years. Gleeson CJ (with whom Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J agreed) held that the head sentence, although a heavy one, was within the range of discretion however the minimum term was found to be excessive. It was reduced to seven years.  
     
      
    40 In R v Davie (unreported), Court of Criminal Appeal, 10 June 1992 the Court considered an application for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on the appellant on his plea of guilty to three offences of homosexual intercourse with children under the age of 16 years. Each offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years’ penal servitude. The first offence involved an act of fellatio with a male child aged six years. The second offence also involved an act of fellatio with another male child who was aged five years. The third offence involved an act of anal intercourse with a third male child who was aged nine years. In each case the appellant had been in a position of trust in relation to his victim. He had recorded his activities on camera. The offences were carefully planned. The sentencing Judge was asked to take into account a further 29 offences of a similar nature involving six other young male children. The appellant was sentenced to an effective term of 12 years’ penal servitude comprising a minimum term of eight years and an additional term of four years. The appellant had been before the Court some years earlier, when he was aged 16, for offences involving similar activity and on that occasion had been extended leniency. Gleeson CJ (with whom Sheller JA and Newman J agreed) held that the objective circumstances of the offences were so serious that the sentences were within the bounds of proper discretion.  
     
      
    41 In R v Hill (unreported), Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 July 1992, the applicant sought leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on him in November 1991 upon his plea of guilty to three counts of homosexual intercourse with one victim, eight counts of sexual intercourse with various boys, two counts of inciting one boy to have homosexual intercourse with another boy, nine counts of indecent assault and one count of inciting an act of indecent assault. The offences involved seven complainants whose ages at the time of the offences mostly ranged from nine to 12 years (there being one boy aged about 14 or 15 years).  
     
      
    42 The most serious offence charged in Hill was homosexual intercourse with a boy under the age of 10 years. The applicant was sentenced for this offence to a minimum term of 12 years with an additional term of four years. On the other counts of sexual and homosexual intercourse the applicant was sentenced to fixed terms of penal servitude for four years. On the counts of indecent assault, inciting homosexual intercourse and inciting indecent assault the applicant was in each instance sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of one year. All sentences were concurrent. The offences involved a range of sexual misconduct, fondling a boy’s penis, oral intercourse either by or on the boy, anal intercourse, and acts of gross indecency. On occasions three boys were involved at the one time. In some instances the applicant recorded the activity on videotape. The material revealed extensive criminal conduct between April 1987 and February 1991. Hill had a bad record for sexual offences. Smart AJ (with whose judgment Gleeson CJ and Caruthers J agreed) considered the sentence to be “a lengthy and heavy one.” There was however a need to protect the public and little or no prospect of rehabilitation. The appeal was dismissed.  
     
      
    43 In R v Eagles (unreported), Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993 the applicant applied for leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on him for 18 assaults committed upon five young boys. A number of the offences occurred in circumstances in which the victim had come into contact with the applicant through his participation in the scouting movement. In one instance the applicant had been baby-sitting the victim whilst his mother, a near neighbour, worked nightshift. The offences included counts of homosexual intercourse with a male under 18 years under to s 78K, an offence punishable by a maximum term of penal servitude for 10 years. These offences involved anal intercourse with boys aged 10 years and 11 years. The offender defended the first of the charges involving victim A, a 10 year-old child. Following his conviction he pleaded guilty to offences involving the other four victims and asked that a further number of offences be taken into account on a schedule. The overall sentence imposed was ten years consisting of a minimum term of penal servitude of seven years and an additional term of three years. The sentence was described by Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Allen and Newman JJ agreed) as being “perhaps at or near the top of the range” but nonetheless within discretion.  
     
      
    44 In R v Fisk (unreported), Court of Criminal Appeal, 21 July 1998, the applicant sought leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed following his pleas of guilty to an indictment charging him with 24 offences of serious sexual misconduct against three male victims. The offences involved systematic sexual abuse of youths who had come from dysfunctional homes. Fisk was sentenced in February 1998. The first set of offences dated back to the mid-1970s and included counts of buggery. The counts relating to the two further victims occurred in the period 1986 to 1988. The Judge sentenced the applicant in a global fashion imposing concurrent sentences for each of the 24 offences. For the 1970s offences the applicant was sentenced to concurrent terms of penal servitude for 12 years comprising a minimum term in each case of nine years and an additional term of three years. These were the longest sentences. The case does not provide a great deal of assistance, since prominent in the way the matter was presented at first instance and on appeal was the assistance that the applicant had given to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. The appeal against the severity of sentence was dismissed.  
     
      
    45 Nonetheless this review of a small sample of cases involving broadly similar sexual offences does support the applicant’s submission that there has been a significant upward trend in the length of sentences for offences of this character in recent years. It is an impression that accords with my recollection of the pattern of sentencing for sexual offences before the introduction of the Sentencing Act. I consider that error has been demonstrated in that the overall sentence is outside the range when regard is had to the pattern of sentencing of paedophile offenders for multiple offences over the period of the commission of these offences.  
     
      
    46 The challenge to individual sentences is made good with respect to the counts under s 81A. The applicant was sentenced to a term of 21 months’ imprisonment in relation to the conviction on count 4 (which charged him with an offence contrary to s 81A of procuring the commission of an act of indecency). The maximum sentence for this offence was two years’ imprisonment. When one takes into account the discount of 10 per cent for the plea of guilty it is apparent that the starting point was very close to the maximum sentence. This was an error. 
     
      
    47 I also consider that error has been demonstrated in the structure of the sentences, which produced an effective non-parole period that is approximately 75 per cent of the aggregate sentence. Again, taking into account the pattern of sentencing in the period, it was an error not to give effect to the finding of special circumstances so as to fix an effective non-parole period somewhat more in line with the pattern of non-parole periods (relative to the sentence) that applied at the date of the offending.  
     
      
    48 Error has been established and it is incumbent on this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. I do not propose to deal with each of the other grounds of appeal, save to comment on them in explaining the reasons for the sentences that I propose.  
     
      
    49 The applicant did not give evidence at the sentence hearing and there was no other oral evidence. It is not necessary to refer to his Honour’s factual findings since this Court is in as good a position to assess the evidence.  
     
      
    50 Victim impact statements were made by MCL, SP and PP. Each serves as an eloquent reminder, if it were needed, of the long-term impact of sexual abuse on children and, as MCL puts it, the mental toll that it takes on the victim. SP describes his distress at learning that he had been videorecorded as a child in a sexually compromising position. PP reports continued difficulty in developing appropriate relationships both with men and women. I agree with the primary Judge that the evidence does not justify a finding under s 21A(2)(g) that the emotional harm caused by the offence was in any case “substantial” for the purpose of aggravating the offence. This is because the Court presumes that offences of this description occasion emotional and psychological harm to the victim without the need for evidence of the fact. 
     
      
    51 A Probation and Parole report prepared by Ms Perrie, dated 20 October 2006, records that the applicant reported a quiet, happy and settled home life with his parents and older sister. His schooling was happy and successful. He remains close to his mother and sister, both of whom continue to support him.  
     
      
    52 The applicant had a creditable record of employment as a music teacher. He has achieved success as a composer.  
     
      
    53 The applicant gave a history to Ms Perrie of depression following his father’s death in late 1974. He had moved out of the family home and become lonely and depressed. He had sought treatment and for a period of about six months he had taken medication for sleeping and anxiety. He gave an account that he had commenced “his relationship” with his first victim, MCL, in 1983. Towards the end of the 1980s, when he said he had ceased offending, his depression had improved largely because his music career was improving. He told Ms Perrie that his guilt at abusing the boys was also increasing to an unacceptable level and that he knew that “he had to put a stop to it”.  
     
      
    54 Ms Perrie considered that overall the applicant presented as a complex man, who exhibited conflicting attitudes towards his victims. While he protested his remorse and regret over his behaviour, he tended to minimise some of the offences and, even occasionally, to feel betrayed by a victim for making complaints about him. He had stated eagerness to take part in the CUBIT sex offender program in gaol. 
     
      
    55 Ms Perrie’s report incorporated the report of Ms Sutton, a psychologist employed by the Department of Corrective Services Forensic Psychological Services Division. Ms Sutton had not met the applicant at the date she prepared her report. She reviewed material concerning the applicant’s offending history, and a psychiatric report written by Professor Greenberg. Ms Sutton considered on the basis of an actuarial risk assessment instrument, the STATIC-99, that the applicant’s risk of re-offending was “high”.  
     
      
    56 A psychological report prepared by W John Taylor, a clinical forensic psychologist, dated 9 September 2006, was tendered in the applicant’s case. Mr Taylor’s assessment was based upon an interview with the applicant and the results of psychological tests. Mr Taylor describes the applicant as having a sexual disorder of the paedophilic type. The tests carried out by Mr Taylor were suggestive of the applicant having adequate control over impulse and drive. Mr Taylor assessed the applicant as having a low - moderate risk of sexual recidivism.  
     
      
    57 Mr Taylor comments on the report of Professor Greenberg in which it is noted that “his [the applicant’s] risk is dependent on whether he has contact with children. Should Mr Featherstone have no contact with children, his risk can be managed and is probably low. However should he engage children or establish relationships with children, his risk for potential sexual abuse would significantly increase”.  
     
      
    58 A number of testimonials were tendered on the applicant’s behalf. The applicant has undertaken correspondence studies with the Emmaus Bible School while in custody. Mr Smith, an Emmaus marker, reported that the applicant had been conscientious in his completion of a number of courses. He appeared to be an intelligent and caring person.  
     
      
    59 An instructor with the Cross Road Bible Institute attested to having acted as the applicant’s mentor in the two years he had been in custody. He considered the applicant to be a sincere person seeking repentance.  
     
      
    60 The assistant to the Senior Chaplain at the Parklea Correctional Centre reported that the applicant had shown genuine remorse and presented as a quiet, friendly individual who had shown himself ready and willing to assist others undertaking courses as well as with their letter writing and other needs.  
     
      
    61 The Reverend Paul Drury, of the prison Chaplaincy Service, reported that the applicant had been a consistent member of the Bible Study Group and that he had displayed a gentle air of courtesy, cooperation and respect.  
     
      
    62 A number of certificates were tendered demonstrating the applicant’s successful completion of courses while in custody.  
     
      
    63 An affidavit sworn by the applicant’s mother referred to the applicant’s work in providing voluntary services to elderly patients in nursing and convalescent homes. She visits her son weekly and is concerned that poor health may prevent her continuing to do so.  
     
      
    64 The applicant’s sister also swore an affidavit recording her continued support for the applicant.  
     
      
    65 I am satisfied that special circumstances justify a departure from the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the head sentence both with respect to individual sentences and in the effective non-parole period viewed against the aggregate sentence. This is because of the need to reflect the pattern of sentencing (including the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence) at the time of the commission of the offences and in the case of the non-parole period imposed on count eight because of the fact of accumulation of sentences.  
     
      
    66 The sentences that I propose will be discounted in each case by 10 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. It was submitted that a greater discount was appropriate in relation to the offence charged in count 12 because the applicant had been discharged at committal in respect of this offence and the charge had only been resurrected at the time when the pleas of guilty in relation to the other three complainants were negotiated. The Crown did not concede that this was the case. The evidence on the hearing of the appeal did not establish the matter one-way or the other. To my mind nothing turns on it. The applicant pleaded guilty to this count, together with the other counts on 12 July, two days after his trial had been fixed for hearing. The complainants gave evidence in the Local Court (AB 147.52). The pleas of guilty followed some course of negotiations. They were relatively late pleas and a 10 per cent discount is appropriate in respect of each of them.  
     
      
    67 I turn now to the remaining submissions advanced on the applicant’s behalf. The next matter is that the pattern of offending had concluded more than 13 years prior to the applicant’s arrest. Mr Boulten submitted that this was some evidence of the applicant’s progress towards rehabilitation: R v Todd [1982] 2 NSWLR 517 at 519. 
     
      
    68 The assessment of the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and, associated with this, the likelihood of him re-offending, is the subject of conflicting evidence. The Probation and Parole officer reported that the applicant’s attitude to his offending was contradictory in that he both minimised the seriousness of the offences while at the same time stating that he had done the wrong thing and that he was “remorseful and full of shame”.  
     
      
    69 Ms Sutton assessed the applicant to be in the high-risk category for recidivism. As noted, this assessment is based on an actuarial measure. It says nothing about whether this applicant is in fact likely to re-offend. I give little weight to it. The applicant’s conviction in 2003 for offences involving child pornography demonstrates his continuing sexual interest in children as at 2002. Given the evidence that the applicant has a sexual disorder of the paedophilic type, it is reasonable to infer that his sexual interest in children is likely to continue at least in the absence of treatment. His expressions of remorse and shame combined with his stated willingness to undergo the CUBIT program are positive indicators that he has prospects of rehabilitation. The fact that he has not re-offended by the commission of sexual assaults on children over a sustained period does demonstrate some ability to control his impulses. There exists a risk of re-offending should he find himself in an environment where there are children. This may be assessed as a low risk, since his convictions would preclude him returning to employment as a teacher of children and his eventual return to the community is likely to be on parole subject to conditions which would prevent him having contact with children. I assess the applicant’s likelihood of re-offending as low and his prospects of rehabilitation as reasonable.  
     
      
    70 The applicant is a person who was otherwise of good character at the time of the commission of the offence. The nature of the offences and the fact that they were committed over a lengthy period means that little allowance by way of mitigation can be extended to the applicant on this account. The circumstance that all the offences (save that charged in court 11) involved abuse of a position of trust aggravates them.  
     
      
    71 It is necessary to take into account the 12 matters listed on the Form One in sentencing the applicant for the offence charged in count eight. This includes the offence involving procuring Ms Horman to give false evidence on the applicant’s behalf. This was, itself, a most serious offence. It is to be noted that the applicant committed the offence against SP after he had been charged with the offence against LS.  
     
      
    72 I accept Mr Boulten’s submission that in structuring the sentences it is appropriate to take into account the sentence earlier imposed for the child pornography offences. The applicant has been continuously in custody since 4 September 2003. This is a matter to be taken into account in giving effect to the principle of totality.  
     
      
    73 While the applicant was on remand at the Parklea Correctional Centre it appears that there were a number of industrial disputes and, it may be other incidents, which resulted in the applicant and other prisoners being locked in their cells on an unusually large number of occasions amounting in all to some 90 days. Mr Boulten submitted that this was a factor to be taken into account in mitigation of sentence. I am not persuaded to do so. On occasions the Court will reduce the length of a sentence to take into account that the offender will be exposed to conditions of custody that are more onerous for him or her than for the prison population generally. There is no question of that here. All the prisoners incarcerated at Parklea (and it may be in other prisons) were affected by these events.  
     
      
    74 The Judge described the offences in relation to each of the victims as being “representative of his conduct”. This was the subject of a ground of appeal since while it was acknowledged that the agreed facts supported the inference that the offences against MCL were representative of a broader pattern of conduct as were the agreed facts concerning SP, the same could not be said with respect to PP and LS. I accept that is so. To my mind little turns on it. The significance of the circumstance in sexual cases that particular offences may be representative of a pattern of sexual misconduct is to deprive the offender of a submission that the offences were isolated lapses. No such submission was made (or realistically could have been made) in this case.  
     
      
    75 The sentence hearing proceeded on an acceptance that the applicant would serve his sentence in conditions of protection. There was no evidence led as to the likely conditions to which the applicant will be subject by reason of his status in this respect. As this Court explained in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [179] special arrangements now exist for classes of prisoners, which do not reflect the harsh conditions, or the degree of isolation and lack of access to programs, which was the lot in the past of persons who were placed on protection. In the absence of any material relating to the conditions of the applicant’s confinement I am not inclined to accord significant weight to the circumstance that he is a protection prisoner.  
     
      
    76 The effect of the sentences that I propose is that the applicant will be subject to an effective non-parole period of seven years dating from 4 September 2004. Taking into account the earlier sentence, the applicant will have been in custody for eight years before he is eligible to be considered for release on parole. The sentences that I propose in the aggregate amount to a term of 12 years and seven months. The effective non-parole period is a little over 55 per cent of this term.  
     
      
    77 I propose that in relation to the offences charged in counts one, two, four, five and 12 the sentences be for fixed terms without a non-parole period. The Court is required by s 45 of the Sentencing Procedure Act to make a record of the reasons for declining to set a non-parole period in relation to each of these sentences. My reason is in each case because the sentences that are to be imposed in relation to the remaining counts make the specification of non-parole periods for these offences of no utility. 78 The sentences imposed for the offences charged in counts three, four, five and seven are in each case for a term of less than three years and the Court is required by s 50 of the Sentencing Procedure Act to order the applicant’s release on parole at the end of the non-parole period, even though it appears that he may not be eligible for release because of other sentences to which he is subject.  
     
      
    79 I have taken into account the principle of totality in the structure of the sentences. It is this consideration that explains why the sentences imposed for the offences charged in counts five and six (the third discrete episode of offending against MCL) involved a very modest degree of accumulation on the earlier sentences for offences against that complainant.

    1 HIS HONOUR: This is a trial by Judge alone pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The accused was represented by solicitor and counsel and there is no question that he was able to give consent and is fit to stand trial notwithstanding that he suffers from a mental illness for which he is currently being treated. 
     
      
    2 He was arraigned before me on an indictment alleging a charge that on 8 January 2007 he murdered Mario Acquaro. He pleaded not guilty, the only issue for determination being whether he was mentally ill at the time of the killing. No witnesses were called before me and the matter was to be determined on an agreed statement of facts together with a number of statements from witnesses. There was also placed in evidence two reports from forensic psychiatrists. A recording of an interview with police that was taken at the scene of the killing was played at the hearing. 
     
      
    3 The facts can be stated very briefly as there is no contest about them. At about 2 pm the accused entered the back door of a cafe owned and run by the deceased. He had at one time worked there as a kitchen hand. He was armed with a knife and immediately confronted the deceased who was at the time taking a telephone call. The accused stabbed the deceased in the neck and they moved out into the laneway that ran behind the cafe and from which the accused had entered the premises. 
     
      
    4 A number of witnesses observed the accused straddling the deceased, who was lying on the ground, and repeatedly stabbing him to the neck. The deceased’s fiancée tried to stop the accused by striking him with her handbag, but to no avail. When one of the witnesses told him to stop, the accused said, “He didn’t say sorry, he only said sorry once.” Another witness heard the accused shout at the deceased as he was stabbing him, “Are you sorry now? Are you sorry now?” 
     
      
    5 Eventually the accused stopped his attack, stood up and threw the knife on the ground. By this time police had arrived and the accused moved toward them. When asked what had happened by one of the officers, the accused acknowledged that he had stabbed the deceased. After his arrest the accused said to the officer, “Yeah he’s dead he deserved it………He deserved it he molested my girlfriend.” 
     
      
    6 The accused was taken to North Sydney police station. After being taken from the police vehicle, the accused said, “I have to say now this is the result of a conspiracy against me, it has been going on for three years.” He later said that he was under surveillance by either the Federal police or a spy agency. He made other remarks that would have indicated that his thinking was at that time seriously disordered. 
     
      
    7 The police obtained a search warrant for the accused’s premises. They located a large number of pieces of paper stuck on the wall of the unit. These contained writing apparently by the accused and which documented what he had entitled “Evolution of Current Rape Victim”. The documents are in an ordered sequence setting out what he believed to be the sexual abuse of his ex girlfriend by various persons connected with restaurant premises where the accused had worked. The deceased is named as having kidnapped and raped her. The accused also writes of the deceased referring to her as “toilet paper” and setting up a brothel. 
     
      
    8 There is a reference to the accused asking the victim to name her abusers but that she refused and “non-intended domestic violence ensues”. This relates to a charge against the accused of assaulting his ex-girlfriend that was brought against him in November 2006. On that occasion he accused her of being a prostitute and having a secret boyfriend. That charge is still outstanding in the Local Court awaiting resolution of the present matter. 
     
      
    9 Police interviewed the accused about the stabbing over several hours. Many of the answers provided by the accused are long rambling accounts of his being under surveillance. Eventually he set out in great detail the conspiracy about his ex-girlfriend that he had written out on the sheets of paper in his unit and which included the deceased. There are almost a thousand questions and answers in the period from 5.45pm to the conclusion of the interview at 9.13pm. 
     
      
    10 The police also conducted a short interview in the laneway in which the accused lucidly but without any emotion describes the killing of the deceased. However, at the end of it he mentions that he wants to see a lawyer because of the illegal surveillance of him that has been taking place. 
     
      
    11 On 9 January 2007 a psychiatrist and a nurse working within the correctional centre where the accused was placed on remand, prepared a report for the magistrate at the Manly Local Court indicating that the accused was suffering from an acute psychotic illness. On 10 January 2007 the accused was transferred to the Long Bay Prison Hospital and a notification was made to the Mental Health Tribunal under s 97(2) of the Mental Health Act 1990 (now repealed). The accused was declared to be suffering from a mental illness by two medical practitioners in accordance with the provisions of that Act. On 15 January 2007 a decision was made to retain the accused in the hospital because he was still “extremely delusional”. 
     
      
    12 On 15 February two psychiatrists, Dr Wilcox and Dr Kasinathan, prepared a report for the Mental Health Review Tribunal. They concluded that the accused had been suffering from undiagnosed paranoid schizophrenia for the last three years. By then he was being treated with anti-psychotic medication but was still suffering delusions. They recommended that he should remain for treatment in the hospital. There was also a report prepared for the Tribunal by the nurse treating the accused. She was of the view that the accused had made some progress but remained mentally unwell with fixed delusional beliefs. 
     
      
    13 It is abundantly clear that the killing of the deceased occurred in circumstances where the accused was becoming more and more deluded. His illness started to manifest itself with the incident in which he is alleged to have assaulted his ex-girlfriend. In the short period leading up to the killing the accused had began to speak about his delusions with others and was making threats against persons whom he believed were involved in the conspiracy to sexually abuse his girlfriend. 
     
      
    14 Dr Bruce Westmore, a forensic psychiatrist, prepared a report for the accused’s legal representatives. He first saw the accused in February 2007 and diagnosed the accused as suffering from a psychotic illness. He was of the view that a defence of mental illness would probably be open to him. He re-examined him on 19 June 2007. The accused showed some insight into his illness and accepted that he had been delusional. By this stage he had been on medication for about four months. 
     
      
    15 Dr Olav Nielssen examined the accused at the request of the Crown. He saw him on 18 October 2007. He had also seen the walk-through interview. He comments on the “abnormally calm and matter of fact way” the accused behaved which he thought was consistent with the presence of schizophrenia. He notes that the ERISP interview makes it clear that the accused was affected by “bizarre delusional beliefs”. Dr Nielssen diagnosed the accused as suffering from chronic schizophrenia. He formed the view that the accused was acutely mentally ill at the time of the killing and would have the mental illness defence available to him. 
     
      
    16 It is clear that but for the defence of mental illness the accused would be guilty of murder. He at least intended really serious injury to the deceased when he stabbed him in the neck. The defence of mental illness arises where at the time of committing the act causing death the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason from a disease of the mind as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong or where the accused cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing. “Wrong” for this purpose means wrong according to the ordinary standards of right and wrong adopted by reasonable persons. Defining mental illness in this way has come to be known as the M’Naghten Rules. 
     
      
    17 It is a fundamental principle of the common law that a person who is mentally ill according to the M’Naghten Rules cannot be held criminally responsible for his or her actions. A person who is not criminally responsible for the act giving rise to a criminal offence must be found not guilty regardless of the reason for the lack of criminal responsibility and regardless of the nature of the charge. However, where the absence of criminal responsibility arises from a mental illness, the court is required to return what is known as the special verdict under s 38 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. Such a verdict is obligatory once it has been proved that the accused was mentally ill in accordance with the M’Naghten Rules. There is no discretion available to a judge or a jury because s 38 is in mandatory terms. 
     
      
    18 Of course the relevant time to consider the mental state of the accused is at the time of the act giving rise to the criminal offence with which the person is charged. Here, that is the time of the stabbing. The fact that the accused may have recovered from the mental illness would be irrelevant to determining whether the defence has been made out. That fact, if it were the fact, would be relevant to what order should be made following a finding that the defence had been established. 
     
      
    19 Dr Westmore’s report of 20 June 2007 contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “[The accused] was in my opinion acutely psychotic at the time the offending behaviour occurred, he was suffering from either a delusional disorder or a paranoid schizophrenic illness. These illnesses are diseases of the mind which would have totally deprived him of the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act. It would seem that he believed that his then girlfriend was being raped and victimized by a number of other men including the deceased and that the deceased was the head of a conspiracy. He developed over a period of months a very complex and intricate delusional thought content that tragically resulted in him acting aggressively towards his employer and causing that man’s death.” 
        
       
      
    20 Dr Nielssen wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I concur with the opinion of Dr Westmore that [the accused] was acutely mentally ill at the time he killed [the deceased] and that he had the defence of mental illness available to him. He had a defect of reason in the form of a bizarre delusional belief that [the deceased] had sexually abused his former girlfriend and had distributed film about it. His delusional belief arose from a chronic schizophrenic illness which is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. [The accused’s] mental illness prevented him from appreciating that his actions were or reasoning with any sense and composure about the consequences of his actions.” 
        
       
      
    21 These are the opinions of two eminent forensic psychiatrists who frequently give evidence in this Court for either the Crown or the accused. There is no reason to doubt the validity of their opinions. To the contrary the evidence in support of their findings is overwhelming. The accused was clearly suffering from a psychotic state at the time of his arrest and questioning by police, moments after the stabbing that occurred in broad daylight and in front of numerous witnesses. Almost immediately after being received into prison, the accused was diagnosed as mentally ill and transferred to a prison hospital in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health Act then in operation. 
     
      
    22 It is clear on any standard of proof that the accused came within the M’Naghten Rules. He was suffering from a disease of the mind that resulted in a defect of his reasoning so that when he stabbed the deceased he did not know that what he was doing was wrong, or at least could not reason about the consequences of his actions. The killing was a result of a severe delusional state of mind that was a direct result of the mental illness from which he was suffering. 
     
      
    23 It was with respect entirely appropriate for the Crown to concede that the defence was open on the evidence and not to argue against it being upheld. This was an appropriate matter to be dealt with as a trial by Judge alone and to be determined on the papers without the necessity of calling witnesses. There is clearly only one verdict that could be given in light of all the evidence. I find that the defence of mental illness is made out. 
     
      
    24 The accused is not guilty of the charge of murder on the grounds of mental illness. 
     
      
    25 Although the accused’s mental health has improved since his incarceration and treatment by antipsychotic medication, he was still considered to be mentally unwell by both psychiatrists reporting to the Court. Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that he would need long-term treatment and rehabilitation before his release into the community. His care and supervision will be under the control of the Mental Health Review Tribunal as it has been since he first went into custody. However, he will now be classified as a forensic patient and dealt with under the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. It should be obvious that the verdict does not mean that the accused can be released into the community immediately but he will be detained in custody until the Tribunal and the responsible government minister are satisfied that he presents no danger to the community or himself. 
     
      
    26 In accordance with s 39 of that Act I order that, subject to the provisions of the Mental Health Act 2007, the accused be detained in a correctional centre until released by due process of law.

     JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: 1. Given a chance Aboriginal people can make a great impact on our way of life in Australia. Aboriginal people form something less than 3% of the general population. There are many areas in which Aboriginal people excel and form more than 3% of participants. Contact sports such as Australian Rugby League and Australian Football League are two that spring to mind. Aboriginal abstract artists certainly would constitute greater than 3% of Australia's abstract artists. Aboriginal singers and songwriters, Aboriginal actors are batting well above the 3% in their respective fields. Aboriginal tour guides, Aboriginal stockmen also. 2. Regrettably on the darker side of society Aboriginals are also overrepresented. Nearly one in five prisoners is Aboriginal. More importantly Aboriginal men and women are overrepresented among drug and particularly cannabis users. Some Aboriginal intellectuals are arguing that it is the Aboriginal men and women who must begin to accept responsibility for and work to change many of the unhealthy aspects of the Aboriginal circumstance. Cannabis use is denying many Aboriginal men and women their chance to succeed that has been realised by others of their race. Cannabis is a drug thats devastating side effects are understated, particularly for long­term users. It can play havoc with the mental health of the users. 3. Kevin Knight’s concern was that the younger members of his race may prostitute themselves to obtain money to purchase drugs. He and his younger brother Brian have sought to present themselves to this Court as pillars of the Aboriginal community in Bourke, in particular focussing on Aboriginal welfare. In those circumstances one could be pardoned for thinking neither would seek to make financial gain by distributing among their own community a product so undermining of health, culture and financial status for their race. 4. Yet today each is to be held accountable for knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug cannabis in not less than the indictable quantity. Brian Knight also is to be held accountable for knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug methylamphetamine in an amount of twenty­five point two grams. 5. As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this Court committed by these offenders, harming as they do their victims in this community Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1 SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to each offender, that is the subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offenders. My fact finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. 6. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of an agreed set of facts does not relieve the judge from his or her fact finding responsibility. It simply limits the material from which facts may be found to the extent if it be the case that the facts as agreed do not reflect, as I suspect they do not, the actual events that occurred. It must be remembered the Court can only find the facts from the evidence placed before it. 7. Each offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any deterrence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, parity, totality, and finally of course the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740, R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSW 329. FACTS.8. The Darling River Local Area Command detectives formed an Operation Reynaldo targeted at investigating cannabis supply by members of the Knight family and associates. In the course of this operation they sought to gather evidence targeting participants in the distribution network. Their inquiries led them to believe Brian Knight was sourcing quantities of cannabis, breaking it down to street level quantities and overseeing street level distribution. Other family members including Brian Knight’s older brother Kevin were believed by police to perform roles in the distribution of this drug in the Bourke area. On the basis of their beliefs they sought and were granted warrants permitting the interception of telephones being used by Brian Knight. The warrants were granted under the investigation parameters of Operation Reynaldo. Of the calls intercepted, some were between each of these offenders. During these calls, code and terminology were used to describe drugs, money amounts and sums owed by various persons. 9. During the course of this investigation, investigators made two separate drug seizures due to information obtained from lawful telephone warrants. At 1.05pm on 20 June 2005, an SMS text message was lawfully intercepted from the mobile phone of Kaylene Knight to Brian Knight. The message read, “I got none left.” At 2.45 the same day, a conversation was lawfully intercepted between an unknown female believed to be Lavinia McKellar, the de facto partner of Brian Knight, and Kaylene Knight. Whoever that female was, she stated, “Brian said to come and get them.” Investigators believe the text message and telephone call relate to arrangements for Kaylene Knight to obtain more prohibited drug deals from Brian Knight for distribution. 10. As a result of the lawfully intercepted telephone conversations and text message, police commenced surveillance of Kaylene Knight. About 3pm on the same day, Kaylene Knight was sighted by police walking south on Warraweena Street, Bourke towards the premises of Brian Knight. About 3.20, Kaylene Knight was located walking north near an intersection of Tudor and Warraweena Streets, Bourke. She was stopped, spoken to and arrested by police and conveyed to the Bourke Police Station. 11. A search of her person located a quantity of twenty separate deals of cannabis secreted in the front of her pants, weighing a total of twenty-nine grams. Later, she made admissions the drugs were $500 worth of “sticks.” She was charged with supply and possession. She told police that a “stick” was a single deal of cannabis worth twenty-five dollars. 12. At 4.07 on the same day, a telephone call between Brian Knight and Kenneth Knight was intercepted lawfully. In this telephone call, Brian Knight told Kenneth Knight that “Kaylene had got put in by Kenny after she left my house and was caught with $500 worth of sticks”. Kenneth Knight told Brian Knight that, “She had some of his deals.” 13. The Crown case is that Brian Knight had been seeking to source amphetamine to on-sell in the drug enterprise and that he was ultimately successful in sourcing approximately one ounce in St Peters, Sydney. 14. On 7 and 10 July 2005, Kevin Knight contacted Brian on his mobile service. Again these phone calls were lawfully intercepted by police. Kevin Knight asked Brian Knight on 7 July, “Hey, is there any more?” The Crown case is this was a reference to cannabis leaf. On 10 July, in another call, Kevin asked, “Have you got another one?” Again, the Crown case is that is a reference to cannabis leaf. 15. On 10, 11, 12 and 13 July, Brian Knight arranged for the purchase of three pounds of cannabis leaf in Mildura. On 12 July 2005, Kevin and Brian Knight and others travelled to Mildura to purchase the drugs. The vehicle they drove in was one owned by Kevin. The deal failed as the middle man was unable to source the drugs. The offenders returned to Bourke. 16. On 17 and 18 July, Brian Knight arranged the purchase of three pounds of cannabis. A number of people, including Kevin Knight, organised the finances towards the purchase of the cannabis leaf. Brian Knight also organised the purchase of an ounce of amphetamine to take place in Sydney. All of the conversations divulging those facts were lawfully intercepted. The drugs were obtained from a related offender, a man by the name of Gayle. 17. Three pounds of cannabis is approximately one point three eight kilograms. An ounce of amphetamines is approximately twenty-eight grams. 18. On 19 July, investigators reacted to the information; obtained and executed two search warrants at the Formula One Motel, St Peters. The two rooms searched were booked and paid for by Brian Knight. In one room, police seized three large bags of cannabis and a bag of amphetamine in an esky. 19. On 28 July 2005, police executed two simultaneous search warrants at premises occupied by the offender Brian Knight, namely 4 Dedman Street, and premises of a co-accused, Wayne Knight, at 148 Meadow Road, both in Bourke. Police seized various items relevant to the operation at each of the premises. At 4 Dedman Street, police located and seized 1,000 small resealable plastic bags, a number of manual and electronic weighing scales, a kitchen blender with residue thought to be cannabis residue, and other items. Police seized the mobile telephone belonging to Brian Knight and satisfied themselves that that was the mobile telephone that they had been intercepting. 20. Brian Knight had travelled to St Peters with his wife and two daughters. He was carrying more than $15,000. $3,000 of that was his own money for one pound of cannabis, and $2,500 of his own money for the methylamphetamine. $6,000 of it was advanced by others, including $3,000 advanced in the name of Kevin Knight, for an additional two pounds of cannabis to be purchased on behalf others, including Kevin Knight. The $3,000 contributed by Kevin Knight was comprised of $2,500 of his own money and $500 of borrowed funds. The balance of money being carried by Brian Knight of about $4,500 was said to be for expenses related to their stay in Sydney including concert expenses (although the tickets had already been paid for) and purchases for their daughters whilst in Sydney. 21. Brian Knight’s case is this was a one-off deal to help him through a financial crisis. He had received shortly before these purchases $6,200 in workers’ compensation settlement for an injured foot. The test of whether he has proved financial crisis can be ascertained by his distribution of the proceeds of this payment. The money was placed in his partner’s bank account. $4,500 of it was taken to St Peters to purchase items for his daughter and to spend on accommodation and entertainment. He was in Sydney to attend a rap concert with his family. The tickets were purchased prior to his arrival. While he nominated electricity and car payments as matters financial, and claimed there was a $12,000 debt at about this time, there is no evidence of any of the $6,200 going on anything to relieve the financial debt. 22. On the information before me, there are indications of suspicious activity in respect of cannabis dealing occurring before 20 June. For example, at 4 Dedman Street there is the 1,000 resealable plastic bags, the Wang scales, the blender with residue, and the network of contacts. There is clear evidence of two offenders being knowingly concerned with the supply of twenty deals on 20 June. That is a month before his arrest as a result of the purchase. All of these facts make it impossible to draw the conclusion of fact argued for that the purchase of the cannabis and methylamphetamine was a one-off dabbling with drugs to alleviate a personal financial crisis by Brian Knight. The onus of proving that proposition rested with the defence. 23. Kevin Knight also argued that his involvement was motivated by financial crisis. His involvement is limited to the first charge, knowingly involved in the supply of cannabis. He contributed $2,500 of his own money that he won on Keno. None of that $2,500 was devoted to alleviating any debts. No documents were produced from the relevant gambling organisation that had paid out the $2,500. He was prepared to borrow a further $500. If Keno presents as a gambling risk, purchasing $3,000 worth of cannabis is an even greater gamble. No doubt Kevin Knight would have believed that even had he lost his investment, he would not have been exposed to arrest. Unfortunately for him, he was unaware of the telephone taps. 24. I am not satisfied there was any pressing financial debt that he was facing. No documents have been tendered demonstrating any indebtedness. I am satisfied both men were knowingly involved in cannabis supply for their own financial gain in circumstances where there was no pressing debt but lifestyle choices that would flow to each from the profits, such as taking the family to attend a function in Sydney and carrying $4,500 to spend. 25. I am satisfied from the evidence before me that Brian Knight was a principal dealer of cannabis supplying to members of his network, including his brother Kevin, and that the brother was, at least on 19 July if not before when they were heading to Mildura, willing to join as an equal distributor and distribute through the same network he would share through his brother, constituted in the main by other family members. OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY.26. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of each offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the case before the Court with criminality of other offences of a similar kind that have been before the Court on past occasions. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. Not surprisingly, the objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 27. The courts and legislature have made it clear that drug supplying is an unacceptable criminal activity. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. Contrary to the impression that offenders may have entertained initially, drug supply is not a social but rather anti-social behaviour. The courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of a drug offence, it is necessary to have regard to the drug’s potential for harm. 28. Harm to others when inflicted by someone else is always anti-social. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by its direct impact upon those who purchase drugs and by its indirect impact upon the community at large. Some if not most drugs, and particularly cannabis and amphetamines, can be addictive. Some are otherwise destructive, causing or contributing to mental health problems - that is particularly so with cannabis - and/or aggression - particularly so with cannabis and frequently with amphetamines. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and to feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by addiction and other effects of drugs. I commented in my introductory remarks how many in the Aboriginal communities are kept down, in my view, by their abuse of drugs and in particular cannabis. That is the real essence of the criminal harm done by suppliers of drugs. That is, that in a greater or a lesser way, they are disenabling other human beings by their supplying of drugs. 29. Associated with drug addiction are other forms of crime such as robberies, break, enter and steals. That is the loss of a gain (property) usually arising from an owner’s productive efforts in the community. Associated with robberies and break and enter offences is the personal trauma, emotional and psychological damage done to the victims of those crimes. The spending of money on drugs by addicts without any other corresponding productivity for the community other than the drug deal amounts to a monumental transference of wealth, usually from the already poor, without any corresponding gain to the economic community. At every level then, drug dealing is conduct that is corrosive on society and therefore anti-social. 30. Brian Knight’s decision to take part in the supply of methylamphetamine lifts his criminality. It is regarded as a harder drug than cannabis. At law, although I have my doubts about it - it is not as high on the list as heroin or cocaine or those other more potent drugs. I am satisfied Brian Knight’s knowing involvement in the supply of cannabis involved his purchase of the three pounds of cannabis, one for himself, one for his brother Kevin, and one for some other person or persons who would also be distributing in the Bourke area. The culmination of that criminality, as with his earlier dealing, as represented by the charge of being knowingly concerned occurs at St Peters when the three pounds of cannabis and the one ounce of methylamphetamine is purchased. All of the offending, including the supply of the twenty sticks of cannabis to Kaylene, occurs against the background that none of these incidents are isolated in his case, including the purchase of the cannabis at St Peters. The purchase of the methamphetamine or amphetamine at St Peters does appear to be isolated. Under the microscope the criminality of these charges then is, generally speaking, an ongoing criminality with cannabis and an expansion into methamphetamine. 31. The criminality exposed by the evidence so far as Kevin Knight is concerned is far less than that of his brother. Initially in the evidence he appears to be one of Brian’s distributors. The purchase of one pound of cannabis, on the evidence before me, represents an upgrade of his role to distributing within the network of cannabis equal in status to his brother. 32. When assessing the objective criminality of the offences, it is important to remember these figures. The trafficable quantity of cannabis leaf is 300 grams. A small quantity is 30 grams. An indictable quantity is 1,000 grams and a commercial quantity is twenty-five kilos. 33. In respect of methylamphetamine, the trafficable quantity is 3 grams, the indictable quantity is 5 grams, and the commercial quantity 250 grams. There is no evidence of the purity of the methylamphetamine, but I am told it was below ten per cent purity. It is argued by the Crown and conceded by the defence that both offences Brian Knight is facing could have been dealt with in the Local Court. In respect of the cannabis, these figures were set long before hydroponics and other developments impacted upon the potency of cannabis. There is a strong argument that, given the dangers of cannabis, the trafficable, indictable and commercial thresholds should be revised downward. However, my task is to administer the drug laws, as they presently exist. 34. Embraced in the facts against Brian Knight is a supply to Kaylene of a quantity of twenty sticks in circumstances where he either knew or was reckless as to whether she would on-supply some or all of those sticks. Indeed, it would seem that his case is he was the distributor and distributed to others knowing that they would on-supply. There is also evidence that on 7 and 10 July, Kevin sought further supplies of cannabis. I have inferred his request for cannabis was satisfied by Brian Knight. 35. The evidence discloses that at the time of his criminal behaviour, Brian Knight would indulge in cannabis one or two times weekly after drinking. There is no suggestion he was heavily addicted or was supplying to finance his addiction. Likewise, Kevin Knight was knowingly involved in supplying, not because of any addiction he had. Indeed, his evidence discloses that he did not use cannabis at all. The involvement and supply was, for both men, exploitive of their fellow Aborigines. 36. While the case against Brian Knight is clear, I detail the basis upon which Kevin Knight is being sentenced. The specific acts of criminality before the court occur on 7 and 10 July when he sought further supplies of cannabis and, it would seem, passed them on. There is no evidence in the Crown case of any financial gain made by Kevin Knight in respect of these transactions. He says he made no financial gain but was simply the conduit by which the cannabis was passed to another, a man named Shillingsworth. The Crown did not seek to challenge that evidence. 37. On 12 July, Kevin Knight made his vehicle available for the Mildura trip. On 12 and 13 July, he travelled to Mildura with his brother. On or about 18 July, Kevin gave $3,000 of money in his own name to his brother to purchase a pound of cannabis on his behalf. On 19 July, Brian, as Kevin’s agent, purchased the pound of cannabis, which thereafter became the property of Kevin Knight although it was at that time possessed by Brian Knight. There is no evidence establishing the size of the network or frequency of cannabis distribution. The only purchase by Brian or Kevin Knight before me is the one on 19 July of 6 (as said) pounds. It is not clear whether that was a normal amount of supply, an expansion or contraction of the cannabis supply. The evidence indicates only one pound was destined for Brian Knight. It is difficult to determine whether Kevin and the un-named other purchasers were replenishing or initiating a first supply. I have taken the view more favourable to Kevin, that he was joining his brother as an equal supplier in the network rather than continuing that activity. 38. Brian Knight claims the 19th was his first foray into being knowingly involved in the supply of methylamphetamine. There is no evidence before me contradicting the claim. On the balance of probabilities therefore I am satisfied it is so. 39. There is no evidence of financial benefits to Brian Knight or Kevin Knight from their activities prior to 19 July, nor what would be the likely financial benefit from the purchase of the drugs seized on 19 July. Doing the best I can and stressing that I believe this to be conservative, I am satisfied from the evidence that for every dollar expended by Brian Knight he received three back. That is to say, he anticipated making $9,000 on his investment of $3,000 for the cannabis, amounting to a profit of some $6,000. Likewise I am satisfied Kevin anticipated the same sort of profit on his investment. 40. I am satisfied Brian anticipated selling the methylamphetamine for about $7,500, making at least $5,000. Of course, the drugs purchased on 19 July were seized. The actual damage to the Aboriginal community from the purchase of these drugs was nil. Nor was there any profit to either person as a consequence of these purchases. 41. There is no suggestion of any recruiting of non-users or juveniles to the consumption of cannabis. I am satisfied they sought to satisfy existing demand without seeking to increase market share by recruitment of new users to their product. 42. The Court of Criminal Appeal has long established a sentencing policy in respect of those who traffic in illegal drugs to a substantial degree. Only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial sentence be imposed on those who traffic in drugs to a substantial degree, see R v Clarke unreported NSWCCA 15 March 1990, R v Kipic and Elias [2004] NSWCCA 452. Of particular importance in this case, more so in the case of Kevin Knight, is the question of whether his purchase of a trafficable quantity of cannabis constitutes trafficking in a substantial degree. That matter appears to be resolved adversely to these offenders in R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal came to a view that it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent to a Crown appeal in that case had the drug in his possession intending to supply it commercially. 43. I have come to the same finding in respect of both offenders. That is to say that the cannabis at the motel as to one pound was owned by Kevin for the purpose of supply and was in possession of his agent. While the one pound of drug may not have been in his physical control, as I say, it was in the possession of his agent. Justice Finlay, speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in Pilley , said,    
     
      
      “Once that finding is made, then the policy laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal that only in exceptional cases will a non-custodial sentence be appropriate for drug traffickers becomes applicable.  
       
       
      Indeed, as was pointed out by Hunt Justice in  
      Clarke’s 
       case, the policy laid down by that court that only in exceptional circumstances will a non­custodial sentence be appropriate for drug trafficking, is not restricted to those cases in which it has been demonstrated that a profit has been obtained. That policy is principally directed to trafficking, the dissemination of drugs to others. The position is worse when there has been a profitable commercial exploitation, but the trafficking alone in any substantial degree will normally lead to a custodial sentence.”  
      
     44. Whatever that judgment may say about the concept of “trafficking” when applied to drug matters against its normal meaning of the word, it clearly is a judgment binding upon judges of this Court, cf R v Ozer NSWCCA 9 November 1993. In those circumstances, I find that Kevin Knight’s involvement amounted to trafficking to a substantial degree. That finding is based principally upon his purchase of the one pound lot of cannabis. I could not make that finding on the other matters relied upon by the Crown in this case. It follows I also find Brian Knight’s involvement in both the cannabis and the methylamphetamine and the ongoing nature of his activities amounts to trafficking in a substantial degree. SUBJECTIVE MATTERS 45. I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offences but I am also sentencing each of these offenders for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by these offenders, or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. KEVIN KNIGHT- SUBJECTIVE CASE46. I turn to the case of Kevin Knight firstly. He was born in December 1950. He was aged fifty-four at the time of the offence and fifty-seven at the time of sentencing. He is grandfather to two children of his thirty year old daughter. He also has a son aged fourteen at boarding school in Dubbo. He has a long term partner of eighteen years. He is the fourth of fifteen siblings, many of whom live in the western region, all of whom are still alive. His mother lives in Bourke in the house next door to his brother Brian. His family is very supportive of him. He has lived in Bourke all of his adult life. EDUCATION, SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE.47. Kevin Knight completed 6 th grade primary in Bourke. He says by this time he was sixteen and left school to work at the abattoirs. Due to his father’s employment principally as a fencer in rural industry, the family from time to time lived in remote communities of Weilmoringle, Enngonia and Wanaaring. During his mature years, he had held numerous positions of significance in the Aboriginal community in western New South Wales, including regional counsellor for ADSIC, founding member of the local CDEP, was chairman of the Orana Haven Drug Rehabilitation Centre for five years, manager of the Dunvi Proclaimed Place, a respite centre for homeless men and women, director of Aboriginal health, presumably the local Aboriginal Medical Service, on the board of directors of the Aboriginal Legal Service. He was a field officer for five years with one of these organisations. He left in 2002 because of a shoulder injury. He is co-founder of the Boomerang Cricket team and the Bourke Aboriginal rugby league team. Clearly he has skills relating to management and formulating policy directions for organisations focused upon Aboriginal welfare and lifestyle choices. GENERAL HEALTH. 48. Mr Kevin Knight presents as an obese man of fifty-seven years. Presently he is on workers’ compensation as a result of a shoulder injury in 2002. This injury is still painful. He manages the pain by taking Panadeine Forte. He also suffers from an ulcer, has high cholesterol. Both are subject to medication. Health summary sheet, exhibit KK1, that I have assumed comes from the practice of Rebecca Oates, and printed on 3 April this year, describes his current active problems: “acute bronchitis,” apparently first reported in 2001. The current status of that condition is not otherwise developed in the evidence before me. Included among past illnesses is a diagnosis of “reactive depression” in 2002. I have assumed that that depression has resolved. There are five medications listed. I am able to identify the cholesterol, depression and pain medication. The others are given for purposes I have not identified. I note in the health report no diagnosis of ulcers. MENTAL HEALTH. 49. There is a past complaint of reactive depression for which he was prescribed Edronax. He no longer takes it as it was not beneficial. There is nothing before me to otherwise suggest that there are any mental health issues that could impact or should impact upon the sentencing outcome. DRUG AND ALCOHOL. 50. There appear to be no drug and alcohol issues of any significance. CHARACTER AND CRIMINAL HISTORY.51. This offender appears to have played an active role within organisations focused upon Aboriginal welfare, health and lifestyle choices for the past twenty or so years. There are four references tendered noting his contribution in these areas. While there are criminal antecedents, but for an offensive behaviour in 2002 his last court appearance and his last conviction were for possessing prohibited drug in 1986. He was incarcerated as an adult for seven days in 1969 (vagrancy), three months for stealing in 1969, six weeks for larceny (1972), two months for indecent behaviour (1972). As a child he spent time at the Mittagong Boys’ Home. It would appear from his record that may have been in July 1968, but it would appear he was out by January 1969, a period of only six months, in circumstances where he suggested it was eighteen. It is difficult for me to resolve that difference. All of his offending has been in the Local Court. But for an appeal against severity, this is his first occasion in the District Court. But for one drug possession charge in 1986, there are no other drug matters on his record. ATTITUDE TO THE OFFENCE. 52. Given that I have rejected his claimed financial difficulties, my view is he has sought to mitigate his involvement with an unfounded claim. Nonetheless, when he gave evidence he appeared frank and otherwise willing to acknowledge his involvement in the purchase of the pound of cannabis. When speaking to Probation and Parole, he denied being part of an organised enterprise. I accept that minds may differ as to what is meant by “organised enterprise.” However, I am satisfied he worked within and, more importantly, was intending to distribute within a network comprised of extended family and associates in Bourke that he knew his brother was involved with. His plea, once entered, was acknowledgement of his responsibility for his offending behaviour. 53. I have some difficulty understanding why someone who had been involved in drug rehabilitation for 5 years and in Aboriginal health could become involved in trafficking in drugs within the Aboriginal community. To Kevin Knight’s credit, he professes shame at his involvement, sorrow and embarrassment. He recognises his family has suffered because of his involvement. PLEA STATUS. 54. The Crown and defence argue the plea was early entered. The court file appears to the contrary. He was committed for trial to this Court. He has been before this Court on six occasions before the accused was arraigned. Upon arraignment on 15 October 2007, he pleaded guilty. The matter’s first appearance in this Court appears to be in late 2006. The defence case is the matter was assigned to his present solicitors in May 2007. Counsel was briefed in July 2007. There were difficulties securing a grant of legal aid for counsel between July and September. There was a conference with counsel in September 2007 and the plea was entered in October 2007. This very chronology makes the point the utilitarian value of the plea must necessarily be less than the utilitarian value of a plea entered before the Local Court. None of those transactions would have occurred but for the plea not being entered in the Local Court. 55. It was said he was charged with two offences. While that may be so and his position in respect of the second charge has been vindicated, he was always charged with knowingly involved in the supply of cannabis. There was nothing to stop him pleading to that charge before the magistrate. Further, he was represented by an experienced solicitor in late 2006 when the matter first came before this Court. He was also in the care of a solicitor who held himself out as competent to advise and represent him until July 2007 when Ms Mendes was briefed. If discounts of twenty-five percent are reserved for those who plead guilty at the earliest opportunity on the basis that the utilitarian value to the overall administration of criminal justice, including freeing up Court time, resources of the profession and defence, then where the Court, defence and prosecution resources are consumed to a greater extent after committal, the discount must be lighter in the light of the consumption of those resources. In this case I intend to discount the sentence I otherwise would have given by seventeen and a half per cent in recognition of its utilitarian value. REHABILITATION PROSPECTS. 56. This offender’s rehabilitation prospects must be regarded as good because of strong family support, his mature age, and his past commitment to the Aboriginal community. He has a regular income stream from workers’ compensation, and there is contrition and acceptance of responsibility for his offending conduct. PARITY. 57. It is important that the role of parity in sentencing be understood. It plays a part in this sentence. It does not play a part in Mr Brian Knight’s sentence. Parity is a check available in circumstances where a higher sentence than that received by a co-offender or related offender would cause a justifiable sense of grievance. The doctrine of parity, properly applied, may have the effect of driving a prospective sentence downward. It should not be called in aid to drive a prospective sentence upwards. 58. Ms Mendes calls in aid the sentences received by the related offender, Gayle. Gayle had been contacted by Brian Knight in numerous phone calls on 17 and 18 July. In these calls, Brian Knight sought to be supplied with and Gayle agreed to supply him with three pounds of cannabis and one ounce of methylamphetamine at St Peters. Gayle was before the Penrith District Court on indictment. There was only one prior drug matter in his record, cultivate small quantity of cannabis plant. For the supply of amphetamine he received a suspended sentence of two years. For the supply of an indictable amount of cannabis he received 500 hours community service. It is to be remembered he supplied the three pounds of cannabis. Kevin Knight’s criminal involvement in that supply is limited to only one pound. It would appear the sentencing judge came to a view Gayle had drug problems of a sufficient level to require rehabilitation conditions on the bond. 59. The Crown's answer to the parity argument is that in drug cases one looks to the actual role played by an offender. In Gayle’s case, it would appear it was the one-off supply of an indictable quantity of two different species of drugs. In Kevin Knight’s case, it is the participation in his brother’s network demonstrated by two episodes and his participation in the purchase of a pound of cannabis with the intent to supply it. While I have accepted that Kevin Knight’s purchase of the cannabis with intent to supply it amounted to trafficking to a substantial degree, I regard Gayle’s sale of the product as trafficking to a more substantial degree. One was the actual transfer of the goods, the other was an intent to do so. There is a case for accepting Kevin Knight may have a legitimate and justifiable sense of grievance if he received a penalty greater than Gayle’s. EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES, YES OR NO? 60. The defence also sought to argue exceptional circumstances.61. Ms Mendes sought to argue that there were a number of circumstances that brought this case within the exceptional. She argued there was a delay of almost three years between the commission of the offence and the sentencing disposition being announced. This Court seeks to resolve matters within twelve months from committal. In country regions, particularly in trial matters, that target cannot always be met. The plea was entered into in October 2007 and is being finalised in April 2008. During the period January 2007 to October 2007, the matter was in a trial list. While there is a delay in finalising the matter, there is no authority before me for the proposition that a delay of, say, two years is such as to amount to an exceptional circumstance to a charge, so that what should otherwise be a sentence of full time custody becomes one of something less. Delay of two years in an appropriate case may mitigate the length of custody, but it would not be sufficient to change it into something other than full time custody. 62. Ms Mendes also sought to argue other factors were exceptional, namely demonstrated rehabilitation, twenty-two years without conviction, the likely impact of imprisonment on a fifty-seven year old male of ill health. There is no evidence of the likely impact of imprisonment upon Kevin Knight, nor is his health so precarious as to amount to an exceptional circumstance. The presence of extra-curial punishment, namely the financial burden imposed upon the offender in maintaining insurance payments upon his motor vehicle whilst it has been in police custody; the offender’s prior contributions to and good regard of the Bourke Aboriginal Community service - none of those subjective features would amount to exceptional circumstances either on their own or accumulated. In Cacciola (1998) 104 A Crim R 178, Priestley said,  
     
      
      “...I am not intending to give any foothold for the idea that subjective matters in the respondent’s case were such as to constitute exceptional circumstances of the kind referred to in the leading decisions of this court as being the sort of exceptional circumstance necessary to justify the non-imposition of a custodial sentence for offences of this kind. A distinction needs to be drawn between the strong subjective case and the exceptional circumstances which justify a non-custodial sentence.”  
      
     AVAILABILITY OF SUMMARY JURISDICTION. 63. My attention has been drawn to the fact that this offender’s charge could have been dealt with in the Local Court. Presumably the election to have the matter dealt with on indictment was made by the prosecution at a time when this offender was also charged with knowingly concerned with the supply of methylamphetamine. I am aware that others within the network were charged with supplying cannabis. All related offenders but for Gayle were dealt with in the Bourke Local Court. Penalties ranged from s 9 bonds, community service order, s 12 suspended sentences and one fixed term of three months full time custody. The maximum penalty for this offence before the Local Court is two years imprisonment. JIRS STATISTICS. 64. The maximum penalty for the offence in this Court is ten years imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000. Bearing in mind the Local Court deals with supply of cannabis up to but not including commercial quantity, most sentencing for supply of cannabis would be finalised in that jurisdiction. Of 1,149 cases, only 20% resulted in full time incarceration. 75% of cases before the Local Court resulted in fines, s 9 bonds, community service orders or suspended sentences. It is impossible to tell from the presentation of the statistics which case involved a commercial quantity of cannabis but I am satisfied many, many of them did. 65. Statistics for cases coming before the higher courts shows that 50% receive a sentence of less than full time custody. 45% of those given full time custody receive sentences of two years or less. An overview from all of the Courts puts less than 25% of cannabis suppliers going into full time custody. In Cacciola , the Court’s attention had been drawn to the JIRS statistics as they existed in a total of 714 cases for supplying methylamphetamine. His Honour said, 
     
      
      “To the extent that statistics may have any use for present purposes, they do suggest that there may be amongst sentencing judges at first instance a too frequent non-compliance with what has been said in this court (CCA) about the necessity for cases of this kind to be punished by custodial sentences unless in exceptional circumstances. Perhaps that has occurred by reason of a very broad understanding of exceptional circumstances, perhaps it has occurred by reason of not paying sufficient regard to what this court has said in  
     Clarke 
      or following cases. One thing we would hope would come from the present decision is that sentencing judges will pay proper regard to what has often been said in this court on this point.”  
     That is a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal given in 1998, a decade ago. There has been no substantial shift in sentencing outcomes that I can see in the past ten years. 66. In Kevin Knight’s case there are seriously competing tensions: Consistency in sentencing as exhibited by current sentencing practices of judges and magistrates dealing with cannabis supply offences; compliance with the policy settings authoritatively required of me by the Court of Criminal Appeal and the doctrine of parity as illustrated in the sentence given to Gayle which was not appealed against. None of these ingredients can be combined to make anything of sense. It is clear from the remarks just referred to by Priestley JA that the Court of Criminal Appeal requires judges of this Court to pay proper regard to the sentencing policy as declared by that Court. I am also bound by the same authority to pay proper regard to parity. I am also bound by the same authority to pay proper regard to consistency in sentencing outcomes. 67. Unconstrained by the issue of parity I would have imposed a full time custodial sentence. I regard the well-established principles of parity in the circumstances of this case as the exceptional circumstance taking this offence and offender out of a full time custody requirement. This offender has not been assessed as suitable for a community service order. In any event, I intend to pay obeisance to the dictates of the Court of Criminal Appeal as best I can by imposing a term of imprisonment. A term of imprisonment must be recognised as acknowledging the dictates of personal and general deterrence. But for the plea of guilty I would have set a term of imprisonment of twelve months. Discounted by 17.5%, that effectively becomes a sentence of imprisonment of ten months. In the event that he is willing to abide by the terms of a good behaviour bond for a period of ten months for today, I intend to suspend the operation of that sentence. BRIAN KNIGHT SUBJECTIVE CASE.68. Brian Thomas Knight, aged thirty-seven, is the youngest of the fifteen siblings. He is a grandfather three times over and about to be a grandfather for the fourth. He has two daughters. He has been in a relationship with his partner, an alleged co-offender, for a period of twenty-one years. This offender looks to his family for support. His mother occupies premises next door to him. All of his siblings are still alive. He and his partner are caring for a grandson until his daughter, Renee, obtains independent housing. His father died of a heart attack when the offender was in his mid-teens. He was close to his father and still finds his passing difficult. Significantly, he still visits and maintains his father’s grave. EDUCATION, SKILLS, EMPLOYMENT HISTORY. 69. This offender skipped a lot of school before moving to Cobar where he attended high school. He finished high school aged fifteen. He was halfway through Year 9 at that time. His literacy and numeracy skills remain undeveloped. He claims adequacy in reading, but I note that he needed to be assisted completing the psychological testing. He grades his mathematics skills as poor. He has worked at the meatworks, grape picking and seasonal work. For the past eight years he has worked in the building industry, constructing homes for Aboriginal housing. In March 2008 he told Miranda Stevens, a clinical psychologist, he was working two days weekly with CDEP. It would appear he principally focuses on tiling in his employment with Aboriginal housing, but he has done carpentry and joinery courses at TAFE. He had the workers’ compensation claim I earlier referred to finalised in 2005. He has an interest in sport. He has managed the local football club for twelve months. He also played cricket. He belongs to a men’s group that teaches children about the bush. He enjoys fishing, hunting, spending time with his grandchildren and relaxing in front of the TV. GENERAL HEALTH. 70. At thirty-seven he is overweight. He sustained a work injury to his foot, which was compensated. He appears to have reasonable mobility. He says he is still working two days weekly with the CDEP. There is nothing in any of the evidence that suggests any significant general health problem. MENTAL HEALTH. 71. Ms Stevens, who conducted psychological assessment of the offender, finds he appears to be anxious to a level consistent with having a panic disorder. He has experienced a number of traumatic episodes and secondary to the panic disorder, she says, is depression. The loss of his nephew is one of those traumatic experiences. That still plagues him today. DRUG AND ALCOHOL ISSUES. 72. Brian Knight commenced marijuana use aged fifteen, when he also started drinking alcohol. His alcohol consumption sat at a carton of full strength beer daily. In recent times it has reduced to a carton weekly, primarily Friday afternoons through to Saturday nights. He has attended Orena Haven Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre on three occasions, the last being in 2003. His consumption of cannabis has reduced, as I earlier mentioned, to two or three times weekly, usually after drinking. He currently smokes half a packet of cigarettes daily. His past use of methamphetamine is virtually nil. He has no current dealing with that drug. CHARACTER AND CRIMINAL ANTECEDENTS. 73. Brian Knight presents as a strong family man, close to his immediate family and his two siblings. He has demonstrated a work ethic through his employment years in circumstances where it may otherwise have been difficult to find employment. At a mature age he started training as an apprentice builder. He appears to be well­regarded in the community, particularly for his commitment to Aboriginal housing. He has an interest in sport and the bush. He has sought to share these interests with Aboriginal youths. Regrettably, he has been frequently in trouble with the law between 1981 and 2005. Much of his offending would appear to be alcohol related and in that context several episodes of domestic violence. 74. Between 1981 and 1998 there appear to have been sixteen appearances before the Children’s Court for break, enter, larceny, illegal use of motor vehicle, malicious damage to property, assault and driving offences. As an adult there are drink driving charges, further malicious damage to property, occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault, resist and assault police, offensive conduct, driving whilst disqualified, breaches of apprehended domestic violence orders, affray. Between 1989 and 2005 there were more than thirty appearances in the Local Court. All of his offending has been before the Local Court. None of it relates to dealing in drugs. 75. His antecedents reveal that he was charged on 5 May 2005 with assault occasioning actual bodily harm, presumably to his partner. That matter was dealt with by way of a suspended sentence in December 2005. In the meantime he was on bail. These two offences occurred early in that bail period. The commission of an offence whilst on bail has long been regarded by the law as a breach of an understanding made with the court that, if given liberty during the charge period, he would be of good behaviour. Thus the commission of the offence in breach of that undertaking aggravates his criminality in respect of both offences. In 1991 he served four months imprisonment for domestic violence. In 1994 there was three weeks imprisonment for assault police. There was a further four months imprisonment in 1999 for domestic violence. ATTITUDE TO OFFENCE. 76. As with his brother, this offender claimed he was motivated by his financial situation. For reasons I have given I rejected that explanation. His reliance upon it was also an attempt to mitigate his involvement. Otherwise it is fair to say he has accepted full his responsibility. He was otherwise frank in his evidence, accepted his role in the organisation, claiming he did not sell but rather organised the distribution and would receive the money. He offered to plead at the committal stage to the charges he has been indicted upon. His offer was not accepted. The loss of the utilitarian value of the plea is not his fault. He bears no responsibility for it. He should be entitled to the full twenty-five per cent discount he would have received if his offer had been accepted when first made. That early offer was indicative of a willingness to accept full responsibility of his criminality from the outset. I am satisfied he is genuinely remorseful and embarrassed by his criminal conduct and the charges that have resulted. REHABILITATION PROSPECTS. 77. His rehabilitation prospects are perhaps more clouded than his brother’s. He is younger and has had more recent brushes with the law. It would appear he may have put in place strategies to deal with his propensity to domestic violence. He is drinking less. He says he contacts police when trouble is brewing. This is his first foray into drug dealing. He has strong family support, he has a strong work ethic. He is contrite and accepts responsibility for his criminal behaviour. All of these are positive rehabilitation indicators. SETTING THE SENTENCE. 78. The maximum penalty for being knowingly concerned with the supply is ten years, as I said earlier, and the maximum penalty for being knowingly concerned with the supply of methamphetamine is fifteen years. ASSESSMENT. 79. Brian Knight’s role and criminality is of a much higher order than Kevin Knight’s. In respect of the first charge, his involvement is documented. On 20 June, when some twenty sticks are supplied to Kaylene Knight. There are two other occasions documented on the 7th and 10th. He negotiates the purchase of three pounds of cannabis to be delivered at Mildura and heads to Mildura to purchase. That purchase falls through. There is a second negotiation of three pounds, to be delivered to St Peters, and of course the methamphetamine. He heads to St Peters. He purchases the three pounds, one for himself and two pounds on behalf of other buyers. At the same time he also moves into the harder drug. His intention is to disperse both purchases that he made on his own account within the Bourke community. 80. The purchase of these drugs is the first step in drug trafficking in respect of these purchases. They are to be added to his prior drug trafficking between 20 June and 18 July. He has been trafficking to a more substantial degree than his brother or than Gayle. This is a case where his role within the network becomes important, as the Crown argued in both cases. His is a case where full time custody is required. In his case, the greater criminality attaches to his knowingly concerned in cannabis. This is the greater crime of the two. It has a much longer history than his involvement with methamphetamine. While the indictment focuses on a period commencing 20 June, I am satisfied that was not the commencement of his operation. This offence then has to be seen as part of an ongoing course of conduct. The amount of cannabis I am dealing with is very close to the threshold marking the indictable quantity. In those circumstances this offence falls towards the lower range of seriousness but for its ongoing nature and his senior role in that network. 81. But for the plea of guilty, I would have set a sentence of fifteen months imprisonment. That is reduced by twenty-five per cent which equates to three months and seven days, assuming my maths to be correct. That makes the overall sentence for the cannabis offence one of eleven months and twenty­three days. 82. I intend to find special circumstances. Firstly, his age. He will be more than ten years above the median age of prisoners. That will tend to isolate him. He will be housed in a prison, a substantial difference from his family, making family contact difficult and his time in prison arduous. His rehabilitation is better achieved in the community and indeed, in respect of the domestic violence offences, his recent conduct indicates that he is willing to rehabilitate. 83. The needs of personal deterrence upon release are better met with a longer rather than a shorter parole period. In respect of the second offence, still acknowledging the appropriateness of a twenty-five per cent discount, I intend to set a fixed term of six months imprisonment. It can be seen that my starting point was eight months. His purchase of methylamphetamine was tied in with his purchase of the cannabis. It is really an extension of the same criminality. For that reason, I intend to require the two sentences to be served wholly concurrently. SENTENCING. 84. Mr Brian Knight, would you stand up please. 85. Brian Knight, I convict you of the offence that you between 19 June and 20 July at Bourke and St Peters in the State of New South Wales knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, in an amount not less than the indictable quantity. For that offence you are convicted. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of seven months to date from 10 April 2008 and to expire on 9 November this year. There is an additional term of three months and twenty-two days which is to expire on 3 March 2008. I order your release to parole on 9 November 2008. 86. I also convict you that at the same time and place you knowingly took part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in the amount of twenty-five point two grams. For that offence you are convicted. You are sentenced to six months to date from today and to expire on 9 October 2008. Would you sit down please. 87. Kevin Knight, would you stand up please.88. Kevin Knight, you are convicted of the offence that you between 19 July 2005 and 20 July 2005 at Bourke and at St Peters did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely cannabis leaf, in an amount not less than the indictable quantity. For that offence you are sentenced to ten months imprisonment. I assume that you would want to have that sentence suspended conditional upon you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for ten months from today. That needs to be formally communicated to the court. Before you do so, you should speak to your solicitor about it. I do not intend, unless otherwise requested, to require his supervision by Probation and Parole. Would you see if he is consenting? RICKARD: Certainly, your Honour. Your Honour, he does consent to that course of action.  HIS HONOUR: Thank you. Conditional upon the offender consenting to enter into a bond pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act , I suspend the operation of the sentence. The duration of the bond will be one of ten months commencing today and expiring on 9 February 2009. The conditions of the bond are that you are of good behaviour. Any offence of any kind will bring you back before me, and you will be told no doubt that I have very little chance to avoid sending you to full time custody. The law requires in respect of suspended sentences that unless there are exceptional circumstances, and you have heard what I have had to say about exceptional circumstances, you would not avoid imprisonment. That is the first, to be of good behaviour. The second is to give your address to the registry and notify them of any change of your address. The final one is, in the event that there should be a breach, you acknowledge that you will be bound to come back before me, or some other judge if I cannot deal with it, and it would only be if I could not deal with it that you would not come back before me for sentence. RICKARD: Sorry, Mr Brian Knight, considering the sentence your Honour has imposed, has asked that your Honour would recommend to Corrective Services that he might serve that at Yetta Dhinnakkal Prison at Brewarrina. HIS HONOUR: I will recommend that he be considered for classification for Yetta Dhinnakkal. The sentences that you have served before are less than six months and it may be that that’s the threshold, but I know there is a previous sentencing threshold that may disqualify you. But I do recommend strongly that you be sentenced to Yetta Dhinnakkal, particularly because of your location and your otherwise relatively short periods of imprisonment.  RICKARD: Thank you, your Honour.  0O0

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    HER HONOUR: 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    1 At approximately 11:55pm on Friday 9 June 2006 four young men, each with their faces obscured and wearing latex gloves, entered the public bar of the Whitehorse Hotel on the Princes Highway at St Peters. Three of the men were armed with a shotgun, a knife and a meat cleaver respectively. The fourth man had a bag for the express purpose of carrying away the proceeds of the robbery. The patrons and the manager of the hotel were subjected to physical violence and threats of physical violence in the course of being robbed of money and other items of personal property.  
     
      
    2 II (the offender) drove the four men from an apartment at Rosemont Street Punchbowl to St Peters that night knowing that they intended to rob the Hotel and/or its patrons, and with the intention of assisting them to make good their escape after the robbery. The four men alighted from the car in a street near the Whitehorse Hotel and made their way on foot to the hotel. The offender remained in the car at that location to await their return. Having regard to the location of the hotel relative to where the offender dropped off the robbers and where she remained awaiting their return, I am satisfied that there was some degree of pre-planning on the part of some of those involved in the robbery and, in so far as this offender is concerned, that she must have been party in a limited degree to those arrangements a short time after she left Punchbowl driving the car she had borrowed from her cousin. I will have something further to say about her role in the robbery, and the significance of an assessment of her role for sentencing purposes, later in this judgment. 
     
      
    3 Despite the fact that the men had weapons with them in the car from the time they left Punchbowl, and that they took the weapons with them as they left the car to make their way to the hotel on foot, it is accepted by the Crown that this offender was unaware of that fact prior to the robbery, as distinct from coming to learn of it after the robbery as she drove the men from the area. For that reason, she is to be sentenced for the offence of robbery in company as provided for in s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 without any reference to the fact that the robbery was committed by the four men with weapons (one of them a dangerous weapon as defined) rendering them liable for the offence of armed robbery contrary to s 97(2). The offence to which she has pleaded guilty carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment in contrast to a maximum penalty of 25 years for the offence of armed robbery with a dangerous weapon. 
     
      
    4 The victim of the offence was Mr Ken Jankievski, the manager of the Hotel. The amount of $2500 was specified as the money taken from him. The offender has also asked me to take into account 11 additional offences of robbery in company itemised on the Form 1 in accordance with s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Each of these offences accounts for either money or personal property taken from the patrons of the hotel comprising a total of $4205 in cash, four mobile phones, a watch, a cigarette lighter and a number of wallets. 
     
      
    5 The circumstances in which this offender entered a plea of guilty to the charge of robbery in company warrant some brief elaboration. 
     
      
    6 On 10 March 2008, this offender was jointly indicted with the four men to stand trial on one count of murder and a further count of the armed robbery of Mr Jankievski. All five accused entered pleas of not guilty to both counts. The deceased was a patron of the Whitehorse Hotel who, along with a number of other patrons, pursued the robbers from the hotel after the robbery. On approach to the car in which the offender was waiting as arranged, at least two of the robbers were tackled to the ground by the patrons. A fight ensued in the course of which the deceased was fatally stabbed. 
     
      
    7 On 7 April 2008, at the end of the Crown case, I directed the jury to acquit each of the accused on the charge of murder by reason of the fact that the Crown had no evidence capable of satisfying the jury that the act causing death was a deliberate or voluntary act of one of the accused. Defence counsel were then invited by me to confer with their clients over the luncheon adjournment as to the remaining count of armed robbery. Relevantly, Ms Rigg of counsel who appeared both at the trial and on sentence, reserved the offender’s position until the following morning indicating that the Crown was being asked to consider a lesser charge in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    8 On 8 April 2008, the offender was re-arraigned. She pleaded not guilty to armed robbery but guilty to robbery in company. The Crown accepted the plea in full discharge of the indictment. 
     
      
    9 The Crown conceded that despite the late plea it was nevertheless of some utilitarian value since it could not be gainsaid that the Crown case against this offender on the charge of armed robbery (or even the statutory alternative charge of robbery in company) was overwhelming. While she freely acknowledged in a lengthy and detailed record of interview with police on 11 June 2006, the day of her arrest, that she drove the young men to St Peters and that she dropped them off knowing that they had said that they were going to rob the hotel, she maintained that she did not believe they were serious and the full import of their intentions were only obvious to her after the robbery. Her plea is also redolent of remorse although in the absence of her giving evidence in the sentence proceedings it goes no further than that. 
     
      
    10 The weight that attaches to the plea of guilty in these circumstances in my view warrants a discount on sentence of 10 per cent. This is consistent with an established line of authority that accords some leniency to a person who pleads guilty to a less serious offence because of the utilitarian value in the plea in circumstances when the plea is entered well after the person is charged and where the lesser charge is substituted by the prosecuting authorities (see for example R v Young [2003] NSWCCA 276 at [11]). 
     
      
       
      The evidence on sentence 
       
      
    11 It was agreed that for sentencing purposes the facts should be assembled from the evidence led against the offender in the joint trial relevantly, of course, limited to the evidence admissible against her. I have been invited by Ms Rigg to accept the account the offender gave in her record of interview, discounting as unreliable only that aspect where she denied knowing or believing that the men had agreed to commit the robbery before the robbery took place. While I am not satisfied that the balance of what she said to police is categorically truthful in every respect, in particular I have real doubts as to whether she should be believed when she claims to have left her cousin’s apartment intending to use her cousin’s car to visit a friend without knowing that the four young men would be waiting in the car for her, I am not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that she was complicit with them at that time. In all other relevant respects I consider that she was frank with police and, for that reason, I propose to draw from her record of interview where necessary. What remains unexplained by her in the record of interview, or by the other evidence in the proceedings, is why she agreed to join with the young men in the criminal enterprise at all. Again, in the absence of her giving evidence before me I can only attempt to appoint a reason or reasons. I will return to consider that matter. 
     
      
    12 On behalf of the offender, Ms Rigg tendered a letter prepared by Janet Honnold of the Department of Corrective Services stating that whilst incarcerated the offender was a peer support person for others in custody. Ms Rigg also tendered a number of certificates of achievement obtained by the offender after successfully completing a number of course whilst in custody together with an Inmate Work Performance Record. Ms Rigg also called oral evidence from a number of witnesses testifying to the offender’s character and the progress she has made in achieving insight into her offending in pursuit of a sustained rehabilitation. I will return to consider the weight of that evidence in due course. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    13 On Friday 9 June 2006, the day of the robbery, the offender was working at the Bexley RSL Club. She commenced work at 4:00pm that day and finished at 9:00pm. She was picked up at the end of her shift and driven to Unit 2, 23 Rosemont Street, Punchbowl, premises occupied by her cousin. It would seem that she had earlier made arrangements to visit her cousin (and it would seem stay the night) although she was not expected until later that night or early the following morning. 
     
      
    14 Her cousin owned a white Toyota Celica. It was this vehicle that was used in the robbery. Some time during the evening a number of young men visited her cousin’s unit. Four of these young men were later to rob the Whitehorse Hotel. Amongst them were her cousin SL, two others known to her as FT and RT, and another male, WS, who she did not know at that time. The males RT and WS were juveniles at the time being aged 15 and 17 and accordingly by operation of s 11 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, they were not able to be identified by name in the trial proceedings. To ensure their anonymity I directed that none of the accused would be referred to by their given names. 
     
      
    15 It appears from the evidence that the young men came to unit 2 from unit 9 of the same apartment block where they had gathered earlier that day. In her record of interview the offender said that although the young males talked about “doing a job in Sydenham” she did not really pay much attention to what they were talking about. 
     
      
    16 Some time later the offender decided to drive her cousin’s white Toyota Celica to a friend’s place nearby. As I noted earlier, she told police that it was only when she got to the car park that she noticed that all four males were in the car. She said in her record of interview: 
     
      
       
        
        “…I asked the boys what they were doing and they said “they wanted to go to Sydenham and I was, like, no, youse are joking right. And he goes, no, let’s just drive over there, drive over. We went past there because I, I was, I was, like, asking them what pub are they talking about…” 
        
       
      
    17 After filling the car with petrol, the offender drove along the Princes Highway in a northerly direction towards the Whitehorse Hotel located on the corner of Victoria Street. She said that she missed the left turn into Victoria Street but took the next left onto Campbell Street and then another left onto Church Street facing towards Victoria Street. The offender then turned the vehicle around such that it was facing towards Campbell Street so as to provide an escape route. It was here that the males got out of the car and told the offender to wait. While, as I have said, the robbery was clearly well planned with careful thought given to how it might be successfully executed, I am not satisfied that this offender was party to those plans and that in a practical sense her role was limited to that of a driver. It would also appear that the males deliberately kept from her the fact that the robbery was to be an armed robbery, no doubt in an effort to secure her agreement to participate with them at all. 
     
      
    18 She stated the following in her record of interview: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And when you stopped, what happened then? 
         
        A. They all hopped out of the car and told me to wait. I was shitting my pants, man. I didn’t know where, what the hell was, what was going on. It was, all I remember is them running [back] to were running towards the car, two of them hopping in and someone standing at the door. All I heard was other people’s voices and I didn’t even know what to do. I heard other, when I heard, soon as I heard other people’s voices I was, like, oh, fuck, what the hell… 
        
       
       
        
        …as soon as they jumped in the car I was telling, I was screaming and I wanted to hop out of the car. I didn’t want anything to fucking do with what they did. I asked them what the, what’s going on, what the fuck, is anyone, well, what happened, is anyone hurt. No one, none of them were saying anything to me. They were just telling me to get the fuck out of the area.” 
        
       
      
    19 Later in the interview, she assessed that it was half an hour after the four men went in the direction of the hotel that she saw or heard the men running back to where she was waiting in the parked car. She said she heard fighting. It would appear that two or perhaps three of the males managed to extricate themselves from the fight and got into the car. As she took off, one of the males said to her that one of the others was being bashed and had been left behind and told her to reverse the car up towards him. She reversed the car over a short distance before she crashed into a parked car on the side of the road. Once all four males were in the car the offender drove off. Some short distance away she was involved in another accident. She was told to keep driving but ultimately she refused, either because she was physically unable to drive the car due to her admitted state of terror or because the car was seriously damaged and could not be driven. It appears that at that stage she told them to get out of the car saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m going to get out. Youse can drive the car. I don’t want anything to do with it.” 
        
       
      
    20 The four males got out of the car and ran off leaving the offender by herself. She gathered some of the owner’s personal belongings from inside the car including a personal CD player and some clothing. As she had no money or credit on her mobile phone she was forced to walk back to Punchbowl. She was picked up en route in a taxi with two of the other male co-offenders as passengers. 
     
      
    21 There is no evidence that she had any contact with any of the four males after returning to her cousin’s apartment in the early hours of 10 June 2006 and before she was arrested at her place of work late the following evening. 
     
      
    22 Aside from some of the personal property of the patrons that was found on the street after the robbers had extricated themselves from the fight, and a bottle of alcohol found by police in the abandoned Celica, no other property was recovered. There is no evidence that this offender received any part of the remaining proceeds of the robbery. 
     
      
    23 Where a number of persons agree to participate in a joint criminal enterprise, it is not always appropriate or even possible to assess with any degree of precision the role which each played in the commission of the offence. As a matter of principle, if each were involved together, they should each bear equal responsibility for the commission of the offence since the objective criminality involved in the offending is the same: see R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 at [18]-[19]; R v McIlwraith [2005] NSWCCA 137 at [17] and R v Dukino; R v Moshref [2003] NSWCCA 379 at [27]-[28]. Applying that principle to an armed robbery, where the driver of the getaway car is remote from the commission of the robbery and therefore not physically present when the victim is threatened with a weapon or violence is inflicted, but is otherwise aware of the fact that the co-offender is armed and is for that reason charged with the offence of armed robbery, the objective criminality of each of the offenders is of the same quality. In this case, however, not only has the offender pleaded guilty to a less serious offence, conceded by the Crown to warrant the finding that her criminality is different from, and less serious than, those with whom she agreed a robbery should be committed in company, the objective criminality inherent in the offence to which she has pleaded guilty is less serious. Not only was she remote from the site of the robbery, but she was unaware that the men were armed when they left her to commit the robbery. For this reason, I consider it open to regard her role in the criminal enterprise as distinguishable from that of the robbers. 
     
      
       
      The guideline judgment in  
      R v Henry 
       
      
    24 Despite the fact that R v Henry and Others [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 was concerned with the frequently occurring offence of armed robbery, it is equally applicable when sentencing for the offence of robbery in company (see R v Murchie [1999] NSWCCA 424; 108 A Crim R 482). In order to determine the extent to which the head sentence to be imposed in this case is within or outside the range of 4-5 years specified as a guideline, it is necessary that I consider which of the common features to which the guideline is directly referable are evidenced in the case of this offender, and whether there are other aggravating or mitigating features which will justify a sentence below or above the range. 
     
      
    25 I accept that I am obliged to give full account to what is described as a narrow sentencing range specified as a guideline, however, I am also mindful that the range should be used as a reference point only, in this way ensuring that a broad sentencing discretion is retained and that individualised justice is achieved. That is not only a vital feature of any sentencing exercise but, as the Court in Henry emphasised, the so-called features of commonality do not represent the full range of features relevant to the sentencing exercise where a breach of s 97 of the Crimes Act is under consideration and, in addition, many of the characteristics contain within themselves inherent variability. 
     
      
    26 The commonality of features attracting the guideline sentence are as follows: (a) Young offender with no or little criminal history; (b) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; (c) Limited degree of planning; (d) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; (e) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; (f) Small amount taken; (g) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. These features are reflected in the following way in this case. I am of the view that despite the offender being unaware that weapons would be used to effect the robbery and, necessarily, that they were weapons of a type capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, in agreeing that the hotel be the site of the robbery, she must be taken to have anticipated that actual violence or the threats of violence would be applied to those from whom property would be taken. In any event, her knowledge that four men would effect the robbery and that patrons and management would be confronted with aggression as they went about their lawful business is a matter which places the offending in a serious category, although I accept, not the most serious. That said, and while I regard my self as well satisfied that there was some degree of pre-planning on the part of those directly engaged in the robbery (inclusive of the roles each of the men were to perform once inside the hotel), I am not satisfied for the reasons already referred to that this offender participated at the planning stage even though it must have been clear to her that the others had given thought to how to successfully execute their joint plan. That is not to say that she acted impulsively in the moment. To the contrary. She had more than sufficient opportunity to refuse to participate, whether from the time she arrived at the car park at Rosemont Street to see the four men in the car or en route to St Peters. Even after agreeing to participate, she had more than sufficient opportunity to withdraw once the men had left the car. She could simply have driven away. Instead she waited in the car for what she assessed to be half an hour for the men to return. While this may have been an overestimate by her, at the very least she was alone in the car for some time before they returned. The fact that she was not subject to any force or the threat of force by any one of the four men is fatal to any suggestion that she should be treated as a young woman who was submissive or overawed in the company of the males. On the other hand, I do sense that she felt some alliance with SL as her cousin and was likely impressed by his bravado. By reference to the CCTV footage of the robbery, it is clear that he was the leader of the group. 
     
      
    27 Having regard to my own observations of her demeanour in the record of interview, and what I can divine of her character from that source and from the views of those who have given evidence in these proceedings, I can only conclude that her lapse of judgment is explained by being caught up in the moment and perhaps by some misplaced sense of family loyalty. While loyalty within families or extended families is commendable, in this instance giving sway to it is not to her credit. I accept that on reflection she sees it as a matter of chagrin that, as a young woman who prides herself on having strength of purpose and character, she allowed herself to descend to criminal conduct of such a grave kind. I am also satisfied that she is acutely conscious that she will have to bear the consequences of her criminal conduct for the duration of her adult life. On the other hand, I am firmly of the view that were she to have known it was intended that weapons would be presented by the robbers and perhaps used to execute the robbery with all the risks entailed by that conduct, she would not have joined with them at all. It is likely that for this reason her cousin, SL, kept that vital piece of information from her. 
     
      
    28 I have already determined that the plea of guilty in this case should attract a discount of 10 per cent. In addition, I will take into account in fixing sentence that some additional leniency should be afforded her by reason of the fact that without the admissions made to police in the record of interview as to her presence at the scene, the circumstances in which she came to be there and the detail of what she saw and heard before driving away from the scene, that the police may not have had a sufficient basis upon which to prefer charges against her. That matter aside, the other features of this offence are indistinguishable from the commonality of features identified in Henry. 
     
      
    29 There are no features that operate to aggravate the offence as provided for in s 21A of the Criminal (Sentencing Procedure) Act so as to take her offending outside the range specified in the guideline judgment. The fact that the offence was committed in company, thereby generating greater fear and distress for the victims, is already comprehended by the charge itself. 
     
      
    30 By contrast, however, I am satisfied there are features that serve to mitigate the objective seriousness of the offending although not such as to appoint a head sentence significantly beneath the lower range specified in Henry. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    31 The offender was aged 20 at the date of the robbery. She is now 22 years of age having spent her 21st birthday in custody. She has no antecedent criminal history. She was arrested at her place of employment on 11 June 2006 and taken into custody. She has remained in custody since that date. 
     
      
    32 In assessing the role she played in the commission of the offence, I have already had occasion to note that the offender was in full-time employment at the time of the robbery as a trainee in hospitality at the Bexley RSL and that she left work to travel to visit her friends and family at Rosemont Street Punchbowl on the night of the robbery, as distinct from travelling to her family home at Bexley North, because she had finished work earlier than expected. 
     
      
    33 As part of her traineeship she attended a TAFE college having enrolled in a certificate course in hospitality. Ms Faulknell, a co-worker at Bexley RSL and a fellow student at TAFE, described her as a committed student who was extremely hardworking and dedicated. She also said that the offender encouraged her to maintain her studies notwithstanding the travel time that was involved in her attending the TAFE college and that she has helped her to deal with what she described as worrying family problems both at that time and since that time. Ms Faulknell also made the observation that the offender appeared to her to have matured over the period of her remand in that she was less likely to laugh at what Ms Faulknell described as her stupid jokes. A levelling change in the offender’s outlook and behaviour over the last two years is perhaps not unexpected given her relative youth at the time of the robbery and the fact that she has not previously encountered the criminal justice system. 
     
      
    34 While not in any way wishing to diminish the significance of Ms Faulknell’s evidence as a co-worker and fellow student, I consider the observations of by Ms Mailangi and her aunt Ms Terepo as to the impact of incarceration as carrying significant weight. Ms Mailangi has shared a close community connection with the offender over ten years through the Church of Later Day Saints at East Lakes, a connection that has been forged and maintained over the past three years as a result of Ms Mailangi’s position within the Church as a spiritual parent for young single adults. In that capacity she presides over a class of about 20 young adults who meet weekly as part of the Church fellowship. The offender was a member of that group prior to her offending (something which makes her offending even more difficult to understand) and has maintained her membership of the group throughout the period of her incarceration by correspondence. Ms Mailangi gave evidence that the offender had matured a great deal and was a source of inspiration for the young people in the group. She felt that the offender shows all the qualities of leadership and would be a role model to the class and those with whom she will come into contact in the future. 
     
      
    35 Ms Terepo has shared a very close relationship with the offender since she was born such that she is treated as a daughter. She described her niece as kind, loving and warm. She has maintained close contact with her during the course of her imprisonment both by telephone and with regular visits. Ms Terepo believes that the experience of being involved in the robbery no less than the two years spent on remand have taught her a lesson, that her eyes are opened and that she will never do anything to break the law again. 
     
      
    36 I am impressed by the sincerity and simplicity of the observations of each of the witnesses who have given evidence. It is clear to me beyond any doubt that the offender’s conduct on the night of 9 June 2006 was not a reflection of her true character. Indeed, I venture the view that it was utterly out of character. It is with unusual confidence that I express my own view that she will not re-offend. 
     
      
    37 Her achievements from within custody are not only reflective of her innate sense of responsibility and industry (neither of which I hasten to add were evident on the night of the robbery), they are also testament to the efforts she has made to make productive use of her time in prison and to prepare for her release. They serve to reinforce my express confidence that she will not re-offend. 
     
      
    38 In the Inmate Work Performance Record, she scored a consistent “excellent” in each of the following categories: personal development, industrial performance, workplace development, demeanour, interaction with other inmates, interaction with officers. The Manager of Industries, Mr William Haddad, described her as a committed, loyal and responsible young lady who leads by example. He also observed that her respectful attitude towards officers, inmates and staff has allowed her to advance within the centre’s employment opportunities. In the course of the last 22 months the offender has been employed as a clerk in the warehousing and packaging unit of the Silverwater Women’s Correctional Centre. She has also worked as a clerk for the Manager of Industries and as the librarian. The library is located in the Education Unit and is under the supervision of the Senior Correctional Education Officer, Ms Janet Honnold who provided a report tendered by Ms Rigg in the sentence proceedings. In that report she says as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Jane’s work in the library has been exemplary. She is very dedicated to providing a library service to offenders. Part of the requirement of the position is to undertake training. Jane is due to be enrolled in certificate 3 in library services when her court finishes. This training is run through the corrective services at Canterbury Library. The director of library services oversees this training across all the correctional facilities in the State. Jane is very determined to undertake this training. In the event that she is released, we have organised for her to continue training in the community.” 
        
       
      
    39 I am of the view that, in combination, the subjective circumstances of this offender should be given considerable weight in the fixing of sentence. It is vital, of course, that they do not overwhelm the sentencing discretion thereby diminishing the importance of general (and to a lesser extent in this case) specific deterrence or inhibit the role that the passing of sentence plays in reflecting the abhorrence the community justifiably has for offending of this kind. 
     
      
    40 In fixing sentence, I have had regard not only to the guideline judgment but to the statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission. I have also taken into account the matters of the Form 1 as provided for in Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 156 in fixing the term of imprisonment. Although each of those matters are separate offences, they cannot simply be ignored. They are in my view, however, so inextricably linked with the principal offence, being committed at the same time in the course of the same robbery, any additional need for the sentence to reflect the need for deterrence is already well accounted for. 
     
      
    41 I am also satisfied that special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the term of imprisonment are made out in this case by reason of the fact that this offender has spent two years on remand has not otherwise been in breach of the criminal law and her relative youth. I have however only allowed a slight variation from the ratio that would otherwise obtain by operation of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act as I have come to the view that to do otherwise would result in a non-parole period that would fail to reflect the purposes of punishment. 
     
      
      Orders 
       
      
    42 In respect of the offence of robbery in company contrary to s 97 of the Crimes Act, I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of 21 months commencing on 11 June 2006 and expiring on 10 March 2008 with a balance of term of 15 months expiring on 10 June 2009. 
     
      
    43 In accordance with s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, I direct that the offender be released forthwith.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 20 March 2008 the Court made orders granting leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed on the applicant for social security fraud offences and allowed her appeal. The sentences imposed for the offences charged in counts 1, 6 and 7 were quashed and in lieu thereof sentences amounting in total to a term of 12 months’ imprisonment with a recognizance release order, which took effect on 20 March, after the applicant had served just under four months’ imprisonment were imposed. These are the reasons for the making of those orders.  
     
      
    2 The applicant pleaded guilty to seven offences. Each offence related to her receipt of the partner allowance paid by the Department of Social Security and later by the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency (each will be referred to as the Agency) without disclosing that she was in part-time employment. The offences were committed between November 1998 and November 2004. The first four counts charged offences under s 29B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) of imposing on the Agency by an untrue representation made by omission with a view to obtaining a benefit in that she failed to notify of her employment and receipt of income. The maximum penalty for these offences was two years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $13,200. The remaining three counts charged offences under s 135.1 of the Criminal Code of dishonestly causing a loss to the Agency in obtaining a payment to which she was not entitled without disclosing that she was employed and in receipt of income. The maximum penalty for these offences was five years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $33,000.  
     
      
    3 The offences were factually indistinguishable from one another. Section 29B of the Crimes Act was repealed on the introduction of a new regime for fraud and dishonesty offences into the Criminal Code by the Criminal Code Amendment (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 2000 (Cth), which commenced on 24 May 2001. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was at all material times working on a part-time basis for Caroona Care Services, which operated a nursing home. In total she received overpayments of $55,132.98 during the course of the six year period. 
     
      
    5 The applicant pleaded guilty on arraignment in the District Court to each of the counts in the indictment.  
     
      
    6 The particulars of the offences and the sentences imposed by the Judge are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 - between 19 November 1998 and 2 November 2000 involving an overpayment of $17,125.00 – nine months’ imprisonment commencing 23 November 2007 and expiring on 22 August 2008. 
         
         
        Count 2 - between 30 November 2000 and 25 January 2001 involving an over payment of $1,785.00 – three months’ imprisonment commencing 23 November 2007 and expiring on 22 February 2008. 
         
         
        Count 3 - between 22 February 2001 and 22 March 2001 involving an overpayment of $1,072.54 – three months’ imprisonment commencing on 23 November 2007 and expiring on 22 February 2008. 
         
         
        Count 4 - between 19 April 2001 and 17 May 2001 involving an overpayment of $1,092.60 – three months’ imprisonment commencing on 23 November 2007 and expiring on 22 February 2008. 
         
         
        Count 5 - on or about 31 May 2001 involving an overpayment of $364.20 – three months’ imprisonment commencing on 23 November 2007 and expiring on 22 February 2008. 
         
         
        Count 6 - between 28 June 2001 and 25 July 2002 involving an overpayment of $10,754.32 – nine months’ imprisonment commencing on 22 August 2008 and expiring on 21 May 2009. 
         
         
        Count 7 - between about 22 August 2002 and 25 November 2004 involving an overpayment of $22,939.32 – 12 months’ imprisonment commencing on 22 November 2008 and expiring on 21 November 2009. 
        
       
      
    7 The Judge discounted the sentences reflecting the pleas of guilty by around 20 per cent. The effective sentence was two years’ imprisonment subject to a recognizance release order to take effect after 10 months of the sentence had been served. The recognizance was conditioned on the applicant being of good behaviour throughout the balance of the two-year sentence.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    8 On 23 November 2007 the applicant appeared before Black DCJ for sentence. The facts were contained in an agreed statement. The applicant was paid partner allowance between 31 January 1995 and 30 November 2004. The payments were made after she lodged a claim for partner allowance with the Agency on 28 October 1994. In her application she gave information about her employment status and income. On 2 February 1995 she lodged a further claim for partner allowance and she again gave information about her employment status and income. On both of these occasions (which were the only occasions on which she submitted a claim for payment) the applicant truthfully stated that she was not in employment and was not receiving income.  
     
      
    9 The applicant was first employed by Caroona Care Services on 5 July 1994. It is accepted that in the period between 11 October 1994 and 13 February 1995 she was not working and did not receive any income. Thereafter she resumed part-time work with Caroona Care Services and she remained so employed at least until 30 November 2004. During the periods particularised in the counts the applicant earned gross income ranging from $411.22 per fortnight to $1,585.13 per fortnight.  
     
      
    10 Throughout the period in which the applicant received the partner allowance she was under an obligation to notify the Agency within 14 days if she engaged in paid work or if she commenced receiving income. In the period of the offences she received some 14 letters from the Agency informing her of this obligation. She knowingly failed to notify the Agency of her employment and her receipt of income.  
     
      
    11 On 6 January 2004 the applicant and her husband took part in a random interview conducted by staff of the Agency. She signed a review form falsely stating that she had not done any paid work in the previous 12 months.  
     
      
    12 As the result of the applicant’s failure to declare her employment and income to the Agency, she received benefits at a higher rate than the rate to which she was entitled for eight fortnights and she received benefits for which she was not entitled at all for 145 fortnights.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was interviewed by officers of the Agency on 5 May 2005. She admitted to receiving benefits between 19 November 1998 and 25 November 2004 and to having been employed with Caroona Care Services during the periods particularised in the offences. When asked to explain her failure to notify the Agency, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, I didn’t really when I started – I thought we could get like the help and I could work just part-time. I didn’t think I had to declare.”

    14 The applicant’s husband, Errol McGuiness, was charged with offences arising out of his failure to disclose her income in connection with his receipt of social security benefits during the relevant period. In light of the grounds of appeal it is necessary to refer to the sentences imposed on him.  
     
      
    15 Mr McGuiness received sickness allowance, and then newstart allowance, between 16 February 1995 and 6 January 2005. These funds were deposited into the Commonwealth Bank account held in the applicant’s name. (Mr McGuiness did not operate a bank account.) On 16 May 1995 Mr McGuiness lodged a Sickness Allowance Review Form with the Agency falsely stating that his wife was not employed. On 61 occasions thereafter Mr McGuiness lodged claim forms with the Agency, falsely stating that his wife would not derive income within the next fortnight. He was sent 40 letters by the Agency, in the period May 1998 to October 2004, informing him of his obligation to notify the Agency of any change in his, or his wife’s, circumstances.  
     
      
    16 As a result of Mr McGuiness’ failure to declare his wife’s gross income he received sickness allowance payments for six fortnights at a higher rate than the rate to which he was entitled and for four fortnights when he was not eligible to receive any payment. He was paid newstart allowance for 138 fortnights at a higher rate than the rate to which he was entitled and for five fortnights when it was not payable at all.  
     
      
    17 Mr McGuiness was interviewed on 5 May 2005 and he admitted his failure to declare his wife’s income. He offered this explanation for his failure to notify the Agency: 
     
      
       
        
        “We got no money. You can thump me and shake me and you won’t get any money out of me. But we couldn’t let the grandkids suffer like they were mate, you know?”  
        
       
       
      and  
       
       
        
        “You’ve just got to live in our shoes to know why we done it.” 
        
       
      
    18 Mr McGuiness received overpayments of $26,237.76. At the date Mr McGuiness was sentenced he had repaid $3,193.40 to the Agency.  
     
      
    19 Mr McGuiness was charged with three offences contrary to s 1350 of the Social Security Act 1991 (Cth), which carry a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 months. He was also charged with 10 offences contrary to s 135.2(2) of the Criminal Code Act, for which the maximum penalty is also 12 months’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    20 Each of the offences with which Mr McGuiness was charged were summary offences. Mr McGuiness pleaded guilty to three of the offences and he was convicted of the remaining 10 offences following a hearing. On 27 September 2007 Mr McGuiness was sentenced in the Local Court to nine months’ imprisonment in relation to each offence. The Magistrate ordered his release forthwith on recognizance to be of good behaviour for three years.  
     
      
       
      The applicant’s subjective case 
       
      
    21 The applicant gave evidence at the sentence hearing. She was aged 60 years. She had been married to Errol McGuiness for 40 years. They have three adult daughters.  
     
      
    22 In 1995 their eldest daughter, T, gave birth to a girl. The daughter’s relationship with her partner had come to an end and the applicant assumed the fulltime weekday care of the baby so that T could return to work. The applicant had the care of the child throughout the period 1995 to 2000. On the weekends she worked two shifts at the Caroona Nursing Home. Her middle daughter, J, suffered from significant health problems. J and her husband had four children. J had difficulties coping with each when the child was a baby. The applicant provided a deal of support throughout these periods. This assistance was continuing at the date of sentence. The applicant and her husband were living with two of their daughters throughout the period of the offences. The monies that the applicant obtained were spent on household expenses.  
     
      
    23 T gave evidence at the sentence hearing. She confirmed that the applicant had looked after her daughter up until the child went to school and that this had enabled her to maintain her employment. She said that the applicant’s health had deteriorated since the investigation into these matters. 
     
      
    24 J was also employed at the Caroona Nursing Home. She provided a written reference detailing her own health problems and attesting to the high level of practical support that the applicant had provided to her family. 
     
      
    25 The applicant suffers from hypothyroidism and osteoarthritis. She was suffering from some depression of mood at the date of sentence. Dr McGirr, a consultant rheumatologist, reported that she was on a course of medication for her osteoarthritis.  
     
      
    26 The applicant had no prior criminal convictions.  
     
      
    27 A pre-sentence report was in evidence. The author reported that the applicant had lived a conventional life in the wider Lismore area, having married at the age of 19 years and raised three daughters. She was residing with her husband and two of her daughters in a large house. She often minded the grandchildren while the daughters worked. It was noted that the family was close-knit. The applicant trained as an assistant nurse after leaving school and had worked part-time in this field over many years. Her employment had been interrupted by child rearing and, in more recent years, because of the need to care for her husband following an injury suffered by him at work. For the past 10 years she had worked in an aged care facility near her home. At the date of the report the applicant was working two shifts of four hours per week and receiving $335 net per fortnight. The applicant had no savings. She indicated no interests, apart from work and family. She had initiated repayments at the rate of $50 per fortnight. In the two years to September 2007 she had repaid $2,600 from her earnings.  
     
      
    28 At the date of sentence the Agency had been repaid the sum of $42,800.00, which it appears the applicant’s daughters had raised. The applicant’s repayments to the Agency, from her earnings, commenced before she was charged with the offences.  
     
      
    29 The applicant was assessed as eligible but unsuitable for a periodic detention order because the nearest periodic detention centre was located too far from her home.  
     
      
       
      The Judge’s reasons 
       
      
    30 The Judge noted that the total sum involved was $55,132.98 and that a significant repayment in the amount of $42,800.00 had been made. His Honour next referred to the circumstance that Mr McGuiness had been separately charged and dealt with in the Local Court. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is said that the principles of parity should apply, I do not agree they should apply but I think it is important that I should bear in mind what happened to the husband.” (ROS AB 80.3-5) 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour commented that the applicant had entered pleas to each of the seven counts and observed that “it is very important to bear that in mind when considering Ms Cusack’s [the applicant’s counsel] submission that, in reality, she submits, the husband’s conduct was more criminal than hers.” (ROS AB 81.4)  
     
      
    32 His Honour noted the submission that it was open to him to find that there were exceptional circumstances which justified imposing a sentence other than fulltime custody. He noted in this respect that the monies had been obtained to assist the applicant in caring for her family and that there was no indication that it had been spent on inappropriate luxuries. His Honour went on to say this: 
     
      
       
        
        “So having said that I then have to come, first of all, to the principles set out in 16A of the Crimes Act. Subsection (2) sets out a whole list of matters, (a) to (p), to which the Court must pay attention. The various factors to which I have already referred are all factors coming from within one or other of those lettered sub-sections. I have already referred to the preponderance of authority, illustrations of which are contained in exhibit A, about what the Court of Criminal Appeal has frequently said about offences relating to this type of offence, and therefore, when I come to consider 17A, this provides: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘A court shall not pass a sentence of imprisonment on any person for a Federal offence unless the court, having considered all other available sentences, is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        As the Court of Criminal Appeal has repeatedly said, offences of this nature, carried out over a long period of time, require immediate custodial sentences. It is then for me, as soon as may be, to identify what form that must take, and then allocate particular sentences to the various counts.” (ROS AB 82.8-83.4) 
        
       
      
    33 The Judge proceeded (after referring to the principles explained by the High Court in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610) to pronounce the sentences that are set out above.  
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    34 The applicant filed three grounds in support of the application: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Sentencing Judge erred in not applying the principles of parity.  
        
       
       
        
        2. If parity does not apply, the sentencing Judge erred in not applying the principles of consistency to ensure there is no justifiable sense of injustice when one compares the appellant’s sentence to that of her husband’s. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentence imposed on the appellant was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    35 In supplementary written submissions filed on the applicant’s behalf, directed to the third ground Mr Bellanto QC, who with Ms Ghabrial appeared on the applicant’s behalf, complained that the Judge had made no assessment and accordingly made no finding as to whether there existed exceptional circumstances that would admit of a sentence other than fulltime custody. This submission was developed in the course of oral argument. Mr Bellanto was granted leave to amend his grounds of appeal to rely upon a fourth ground of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in failing to consider that it was open to him to impose a sentence other than one of immediate full-time custody.” 
        
       
      
    36 Ground 1 complained that the Judge failed to apply principles of parity. Mr Bellanto acknowledged that this ground was difficult to make good, since the applicant had been dealt with on indictment for offences carrying substantially higher maximum penalties than the charges of which her husband had been convicted. In his submission, it remained appropriate to have regard to the common factual matrix and an assessment of the respective culpability of the two. This submission was advanced in support of grounds one and two. His contention was that Mr McGuiness’ offending was of a graver nature than that of the applicant. It had occurred over a longer period of time and had involved the repeated submission of statements containing a false claim. Mr McGuiness had not admitted his guilt in respect of the majority of the charges brought against him and his sentence was imposed after trial. Mr Bellanto noted that while the sum involved in Mr McGuiness’ offending was $26,237.76, he had repaid a lesser amount proportionately than had the applicant.  
     
      
    37 Mr Bellanto relied on the judgment of this Court in R v Kerr [2003] NSWCCA 234 per Miles AJ (with whose judgment Beazley JA and Adams J concurred) at [19]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is also recognised that the parity principle is of wide application and is not to be applied or withheld in a technical or pedantic way. It is indeed part of or a reflection of the wider principle that consistency in sentencing by the courts overall is to be aimed at as desirable in the public interest. Perfect consistency is a goal that can never be reached because of the infinite variety of the circumstances of offences and offenders. However there is a danger that it may be compromised by the selection of differing charges so that one offender may be charged with a serious offence and given punishment at the top of an acceptable range for that offence, and a co-offender charged with another less serious offence and dealt with at the very bottom of the acceptable range for that other offence. There may be no impropriety in that course, which will often arise from negotiation between co-offenders and law enforcement authorities. Sometimes, however, and it is not necessary to put it higher than that, the result may have the appearance of injustice.” 
        
       
      
    38 In R v Formosa [2005] NSWCCA 363 Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J concurred) observed that Kerr is capable of being read as extending the principle of parity to apply in cases where co-offenders are charged with different offences. Her Honour expressed the need for caution before adopting any such principle. She went on to say this: 
     
      
       
        
        “[50] Here, the main reason for the discrepancy in sentences on the two co-offenders derives from the difference in the charges they faced. The applicant may have a sense of grievance, even a legitimate one, about that difference; but it is not a legitimate sense of grievance in the  
        Lowe 
         or  
        Postiglione 
         sense, concerning the sentences imposed; it is a sense of grievance engendered by the prosecutorial decision making process. That is not something over which this Court has supervisory jurisdiction, even by the backdoor method of supervising sentencing.” 
        
       
      
    39 The cautionary note sounded by Simpson J has been endorsed more recently in Spinks v R [2007] NSWCCA 52 at [28]-[31] and Shaopang Yin v R [2007] NSWCCA 350 at [23]-[24].  
     
      
    40 The facts giving rise to the prosecution of the applicant and her husband had common features. The reason for the exercise of the prosecutorial discretion to charge Mr McGuiness with summary offences punishable with a maximum sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment and the applicant with indictable offences, which in some instances were punishable by a maximum of five years’ imprisonment, is unexplained. It may be that the sums involved in the offences charged against the applicant were relevant to the determination. It remains that the Judge was sentencing the applicant for offences that in law were of a significantly more serious character than those with which Mr McGuiness was charged. The three counts charged under the Criminal Code (having the five year maximum penalty) involved, in all, a sum of $34,057.84 which was in excess of the total sum involved in all of the 13 summary offences of which Mr McGuiness was convicted. We were unpersuaded that the Judge erred in not applying principles of parity.  
     
      
    41 Ground 2 was couched in language that echoes that of Mason J in Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 612, but advances a challenge on a basis that is outside the principle of parity. This was not a case which raised consideration of any broader principle of consistency in sentencing, whether derived from the statements in Kerr or otherwise, since there existed the distinction between cases brought against the applicant and her husband, to which we have referred.  
     
      
    42 On the hearing of the application Mr Bellanto did not press submissions in support of ground 3, which challenged the sentences as being manifestly excessive. He acknowledged that in light of the pattern of sentencing for social security fraud, a sentence of two years with a recognizance release order at the expiration of 10 months did not exceed the bounds of discretion. 
     
      
    43 Mr Bellanto’s principal challenge was that the Judge approached the sentencing of the applicant upon the basis that he was constrained to impose an “immediate custodial sentence”. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that his Honour’s remark needed to be seen in context and amounted to no more than a conclusion that this was not an exceptional case in which it would be appropriate to impose a sentence other than fulltime custody. The difficulty with this submission is that the Judge, in the course of his brief remarks, did not address the substantial body of evidence that was led in the applicant’s case.  
     
      
    44 The circumstances in which persons, including those of prior good character, dealt with on indictment for social security fraud over a sustained period will avoid the imposition of a sentence of fulltime custody are rare. Nonetheless, the Judge had a discretion and it could not be said that this was a case in which there were no features requiring careful assessment of the submission that it was open to impose a sentence other than fulltime custody. The applicant’s criminality was of a lesser order than that of those who defraud the revenue by the adoption of false identities or by other sophisticated schemes. She was a 60 year-old woman of previously unblemished character, who had made a positive contribution to the community, particularly in the support of her grandchildren. The monies that she obtained had been spent on necessities. She had a number of medical problems, which were such as to make the experience of imprisonment somewhat more burdensome for her than for other prisoners. 
     
      
    45 Reasonable minds may differ about whether these circumstances in combination were such as to admit of a penalty other than one of fulltime custody. The absence of any analysis of them pointed to the force of the complaint in ground 4. The Judge appears to have considered that he was constrained to impose an immediate custodial sentence. That is what his Honour said. To approach the matter in this way was an error.  
     
      
    46 It was necessary for this Court to consider for itself the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The Court received further evidence on this question. On 7 January 2008 the applicant, through the assistance of her eldest daughter, repaid the balance of the amount owing to the Agency. An updated medical report from the applicant’s treating doctor based on her review of the applicant’s Justice Health file suggests that the applicant has had an exacerbation of her osteoarthritis from about mid-February 2008. She has had similar exacerbations in the past.  
     
      
    47 In the Crown’s submission, if the Judge erred in the respect identified in ground 4 or, alternatively, by failing to state reasons sufficient to demonstrate that he had addressed the matters put on the applicant’s behalf and concluded, rightly, that no sentence other than fulltime imprisonment was appropriate, it was not an error that would lead this Court to intervene. This was because, it was said, no lesser sentence was warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 
     
      
    48 Mr Bellanto referred us to the decisions in R v Blaire (unreported), Court of Criminal Appeal, 20 November 1987 and R v Winchester (1992) 58 A Crim R 345. In each of those cases the offender made immediate admissions of guilt and had been permitted by the Agency over a substantial period to continue making regular repayments before action had been taken to prosecute her. In Winchester the delay was two years and eight months. In that case Hunt CJ at CL said this (at 349): 
     
      
       
        
        “Blaire’s Case is one of the many decisions of this Court that those who defraud the Department of Social Security by lodging false claims must expect a significant measure of criminal justice to be meted out to them when their guilt is discovered. But Blaire’s case also said this. Where an offender of the present type makes immediate admissions of guilt, but is permitted by the Department to continue for a substantial period to make regular repayments of the amount involved in the offence before any action is taken to prosecute the offence, what may have been required by way of punishment if the prosecution had been instituted speedily is no longer necessarily required when the prosecution is, without any valid explanation, brought on tardily.” 
        
       
      
    49 There was no explanation for the delay in this case, which was of about one year. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the Court should take into account the fact that delays are commonly experienced in decision-making within a large bureaucracy. The submission did not address the reason why the Court takes delay into account. It is because of the impact on the offender, who after making full admissions of guilt and entering into an arrangement to repay the Agency, is lulled into a belief that the matter will be resolved without the intervention of the criminal law. In this case the delay is not of the order of that with which Winchester or Blaire were concerned. Nonetheless, in my opinion, it was a factor to be taken into account. The applicant, who at 60 years of age had led a conventional life in a country town had suffered the shame associated with disclosure of her wrongdoing. She gave evidence of the upset that this had caused. After being permitted to continue her life, making repayments over a period of one year, the decision to prosecute her must have come as a considerable blow.  
     
      
    50 The matters that the Court took into account in rejecting the Crown Prosecutor’s submission (that no lesser sentence was warranted in law) in the unusual circumstances of this case may be summarised as follows. These were offences of omission lacking in any element of sophistication. The whole of the monies had been repaid. There was significant delay in commencing the prosecution. The offences came about in a context of need in which the applicant had extended family responsibilities. The applicant’s age, health difficulties and her otherwise good character were matters that in combination with the factors to which we have referred justified a marked degree of leniency in the individual sentences, and in the structure of them, including in the proportion between the sentence and the period of custody before release on recognizance.  
     
      
    51 For this reason the orders of the Court were: 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
       
        
         
        1. Grant leave to appeal; 
         
         
        2. Allow the appeal; 
         
         
        3. Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on counts 1, 6 and 7 and confirm the sentences imposed on counts 2, 3, 4 and 5; 
         
         
        4. On count 1 sentenced to six months’ imprisonment to commence on 23 November 2007 and to expire on 22 May 2008; 
         
         
        5. Confirm the sentences of three months dating from 23 November 2007 on counts 2, 3, 4 and 5. Such sentences will expire on 22 February 2008; 
         
         
        6. On count 6 the applicant is sentenced to six months’ imprisonment to date from 23 February 2008. That sentence will expire on 22 August 2008; 
         
         
        7. On count 7 the applicant is sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment to date from 23 February 2008. That sentence will expire on 22 November 2008.  
        
       
       
        
        8. Direct the applicant’s release forthwith on her entering into a recognizance self in the sum of $50.00 to be of good behaviour for the balance of the sentence until 22 November 2008.

   SENTENCEIntroduction: 1 The offender Rick offender, Rick Stephen Giles comes before this court having pleaded guilty to eight offences involving aggravated sexual intercourse of a girl aged between 10 and 16 years and an offence of an aggravated act of indecency. I have also been asked to take into account other sexual offences in dealing with the sixth offence.  
    2 This girl was his stepdaughter and was someone he had cared for as a father since she was six months old. His duty was to love and protect her. Instead of that, when she turned a little over 11 years old, he began a pattern of sexual abuse which continued until she was 15 years old.3 She is now 23 years old and late in 2006brought to the attention of her mother, her fiancée and the police the occurrence of these sexual offences. Police commenced their investigations and in August 2007 she agreed to wear a listening device and speak to him about what he had done. At the time he had separated from her mother and was living in a motel in Liverpool. When she spoke to him on 4 August 2007, he readily agreed that he had sexually abused her and expressed his remorse for doing so. He was arrested on the same day, interviewed by the police and charged with the offences for which he is before me.4 The police interviewed him on the day of his arrest and he agreed that he had committed the offences, and that he deserved to be punished, that his stepdaughter’s life had been adversely affected and that he was entirely responsible. His admissions to his stepdaughter and to the police marked him as being quite different to many other persons who are charged with offences of this type. 5 It is common, in my experience, to be told by such offenders that they were led on and that they were the victims. He has admitted his guilt and remorse and is entitled to be given credit for that.6 The fact that he has admitted his guilt, expressed remorse and has not sought in any way to blame the victim, means that I can have much greater confidence in the possibility of his rehabilitation than I have had in the past with other such offenders. Because of this, I am imposing an overall sentence which is very much less than it would have been, had I not been satisfied that he seriously acknowledged his guilt and wanted to be rehabilitated.7 As is often the case, apart from these offences, he could be considered in a general sense, in relation to sexual matters, to be a man of good character. HeHe is a man who has committed minor offences in the past but he has always provided for his family and has always worked. However, he has also been a consumer of illegal drugs and an abuser of alcohol. For this reason he cannot be considered to be a man of exemplary character and it is clear that during the years from 1995 to 1999, he was a frequent sexual abuser of the victim, his stepdaughter. That abuse included frequent acts of penetrating sexual intercourse involving digital and penile sex, as well as cunnilingus and fellatio. There were also frequent indecent assaults and acts of indecency. These were very serious crimes.8 His admissions of guilt to the victim and his admissions of guilt to the police, coupled with his expressed remorse, and maintaining his pleas of guilty following his being charged certainly has saved his victim the harrowing experience of having to give evidence at a trial. He must be given credit for all of this.9 I have read a reference from his brother. He speaks of a sad family background and have of someone who was a frequent user of amphetamines and someone who from time to time became depressed. His brother is of the opinion that he the offender is remorseful and disgusted about his actions and that he would take the opportunity to rehabilitate himself. An employer provided a reference to establish merely that he was a worker.10 I have also been provided with a psychological report which gives background information on the offender. What it reveals is that the offender and his brother grew up in an unstable home where there were many problems with his alcoholic father and ultimately, this led to a family breakdown.11 He struggled at school and may well have had attention deficit disorder but he managed to pass his School certificate. Since he left school he has worked in semi-skilled employment, sometimes through through labour hire companies. His relationship with his wife ceased in 2001, partly because of his use of cannabis and amphetamines and partly because of her adulterous relationships with other men. He has no contact now with his daughter o r his wife but does maintain some contact with his son. He has a relationship with another woman.12 Throughout his adult life he has had problems with drug and alcohol abuse. He expressed remorse for his abuse of his stepchild and concern for her. He has good intellectual ability according to the psychologist and has a low risk of re-offending.13 I am prepared to accept that much of what is in this report is factual because it coincides with what his brother has said and what he has told the police himself.14 I accept her opinion not merely because of his admissions to the psychologist, but because what he told her is what he told the victim and what he told the police. It is also what he told me in a letter which was provided to me by his legal representative. I have read the letter, which sets out his feelings of remorse and concern for the victim as well as expressing intentions of becoming a good citizen.15 He also gave evidence and confirmed what he had told the psychologist, what he put in his letter, what he told the complainant and the police. He has said that he wants to do a programme, that he deserves to be punished and he would never engage in this conduct again. He struck me as being genuine. 16 I thus accept that in his case there are good prospects of rehabilitation, although I weigh this up against the facts that he provided no explanation for his conduct. 17 There must be an explanation and he has not chosen to reveal it.Objective matters:18 These offences are very serious matters. Seven of them involve sexual intercourse with a young girl. Three of the charges concern penile–vaginal sexual intercourse. The charges are clearly representative charges since it is clear that between 1995 and 1999 he frequently had sexual intercourse with a very young girl who was his stepdaughter and frequently committed other types of sexual abuse on her.19 Because they are very serious offences, severe sentences must be imposed to make it clear that this conduct will not be tolerated in our society. The sentences must also have such severity as to deter others as well as the offender himself from committing such conduct in the future. 20 The agreed facts show that the victim has suffered greatly because of this ongoing and persistent sexual abuse. She has suffered emotional, psychological and physical trauma which has had a severe impact on her day-to-day life and her subsequent personal relationships with men.21 The severity of the sentences must in some way take account of all of this suffering. The sentence must also make it clear to parents and stepparents that if they act in a predatory way towards children in their care, they will be severely punished.22 At the same time, the needs of society are best met if a sex offender can be rehabilitated by the time he is released from prison, because society then has nothing to fear from that offender.23 Whilst I consider that there is some realistic possibility of rehabilitation, I cannot be certain of it. In my view, if the offender does not satisfy the prison authorities that he is genuinely committed to rehabilitation, they should not release him on parole.Other sentencing considerations:24 Because of his co-operation with the police and his early plea of guilty, he is entitled, in my opinion to a 25% discount on sentence. The sentences which I impose reflect that discount. Because there are realistic chances of rehabilitation and because he has never served any previous sentence of imprisonment, I find special circumstances and I fix a non-parole period which is less than it would otherwise be.25 I have decided to impose sentences which will see him released after 11 years in custody. He will then be on parole for another five years. In order to achieve this result, I have made some of the sentences concurrent or partly concurrent with other sentences, but there is some accumulation to make clear that each sentence is clearly distinct from the others. The final sentence has a non-parole period which would not be given if that were a sentence when only one offence had been charged. The sentences must be appropriate, but not so severe as to be excessive in their overall effect.The facts of the offences:First offence:26 This offence was one of an aggravated act of indecency and it occurred in December 1995, when the victim was between eleven and eleven and a half years old. Before this first offence, the offender groomed her for it by being present with her in a shower and asking her to shave her legs with a razor that he handed to her. He also asked her to shave the hair on his chest while he was in the shower with her. This occurred on a number of occasions and was most inappropriate conduct for him to engage in.27 Between July and December 1995, he got into a bath with the victim, facing her and asked her to put her legs up on the side of the bathtub. He then masturbated until he ejaculated and then asked her to step into a shower. He joined her in the shower. 28 The act of indecency is the masturbation and ejaculation in her presence when she was under the age of 16 years, was naked and had her legs up on the bathtub. It is an aggravated act, because the victim was under his authority and because the victim was under the age of 16 years (See Crimes Act, 1900, sec 61O). The maximum penalty is five years imprisonment.29 Committing an Aggravated aggravated indecent assaultact of indecency in the presence of a young child is serious and must receive a penalty which makes this clear. The offence is an offence of gross betrayal of trust.30 But for the discount of 25%, to which he is entitled for his plea of guilty, and my finding special circumstances because of his age and his prospects for rehabilitation, I would have imposed a sentence of 4 years imprisonment. However, because of these factors, I reduce that to a sentence of 3 years which is a fixed sentence.Second offence:31 This offence is aggravated sexual intercourse of a person between 10 and 16 years, namely 14 years (See Crimes Act, 1900, sec 66C). The maximum sentence is 10 years imprisonment. The aggravating feature was that the victim was under his authority.32 The offence occurred about February 1996. The victim, then eleven and a half years old, had come home from school and was playing with some dolls in a bath. She got out of the bath, wrapped a towel around herself and walked into her bedroom. The offender walked behind her, telling her to lie down on the bed and take her towel off. She did so and he leant over and sucked her breasts. He then said he would caress her and started to touch her with his hands on her stomach and legs, moving his hands to her inner thighs. He then moved his hand to the area of her labial entrance and put one of his fingers into her vagina and moved it up and down a number of times before he walked out of the bedroom. 33 The offence is a very serious one. It involves a deliberate deep penetration of the vagina of a young girl who was the stepdaughter of the offender. In my opinion, it is not as serious as penile penetration of the vagina, but because it is serious and it must be severely punished. I have taken into account also the discount on sentence of 25% and I find special circumstances because this will be his first gaol sentence and he is contrite and there are good prospects of rehabilitation. 34 I have decided that an appropriate sentence is one of 4 years imprisonment which will be imposed as a fixed term. Third offence:35 This offence is aggravated sexual intercourse of a person between 10 and 16 years, namely 14 years (See Crimes Act, 1900, sec 66C). The maximum sentence is 10 years imprisonment. The aggravating feature was that the victim was under his authority.36 It occurred in about July 1996 when the family moved from Kirrawee to Menai. The victim had just turned 12 years old. The offender came into her bedroom after she had a shower in the afternoon when she had returned from school. He told her to lie down on the bed and after telling her that he would “caress her” he ran his hands all over her body while she was naked and sucked her on the breasts. He then placed his finger in her vagina for a short time and then left the bedroom. On occasions, he would shower with her and would follow her into her bedroom while he also was naked. This offence occurred so many times that she was unable to distinguish any particular assault.37 The sentence for this offence warrants a greater sentence of imprisonment than the earlier offences because the cunnilingus offences a sentence of 5 years imprisonment as a fixed sentence should also be a sentence of four years imprisonment. The sentence is a fixed term.Fourth offence:38 This offence is aggravated sexual intercourse of a person between 10 and 16 years, namely 14 years (See Crimes Act, 1900, sec 66C). The maximum sentence is 10 years imprisonment39 This offence, which seems to stand alone, happened when the victim was almost thirteen and a half years old. She had come home from school and had a shower in the upstairs bedroom. Her mother was at work and her little brother was at after-school care.40 When she got out of the shower, the offender ordered her to go into his bedroom and to sit on the end of the bed. He appeared, naked from the waist down and ordered her to “ go down on me”. She protested, saying it was disgusting. He then told her he would put on a condom, so it was clean. He did so and said:  
     
      
      “Come on, please do it, you’ll like it, it’s clean, not dirty” 
      
    41 The victim then performed fellatio on the offender for a short time and then stopped. The offender then left the room and returned with a clear plastic sandwich bag. He removed the condom, placing the sandwich bag on his penis and asked the victim to suck on it. She refused to do so. Just then, her mother returned home unexpectedly and the offender disappeared to remove the condom from the sink and dispose of it.42 The circumstances and the forcing of fellatio on such a young girl in my opinion warrants a sentence of 5 years imprisonment as a fixed sentence. Fellatio is a more serious offence, in my opinion, than digital penetration, since it involves the introduction of the penis into the body of the victim. I take into account the same factors for discount of sentence, special circumstances and rehabilitation as I have mentioned earlier.Fifth Offence43 Between May and July 1998 when the victim was aged 13 ½ years, she was in the offender’s bedroom with him. He took out a pornographic video from a backpack, placed it into a video player and played it to the victim who was sitting on the bed. She was wearing her school uniform. After a few minutes he started to undress the victim and took off her underpants. He then performed cunnilingus on the victim for about 20 minutes.44 In my opinion, the sentence of this offence should be the same as for the previous offence as it involves the penetration of the body of the complainant by the tongue of the offender and it involved an attempt to corrupt the child by playing pornography to her.  45 The sentence will be five years imprisonment as a fixed term. Sixth Offence:46 On a Saturday in August 1998, when the victim was 14 years of age, she was playing outside in the back yard. She had pitched a tent and was playing with dolls in the tent for most of the day while her mother was a work. The victim had also been playing in the tent with her younger brother for a while and then he went off to play on his own. She had taken her pillow into the tent and was lying down.47 The offender came into the tent and pulled down the victim’s clothing including her underpants. He took his pants off so that he was naked from the waist down. He lay on top of her with his arm round her and started to kiss her neck. He then inserted his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her. He ejaculated inside her vagina. 48 This was a very serious act of sexual intercourse and the offence is aggravated by my taking into account three acts of aggravated indecent assault, one aggravated act of indecency and three acts of sexual intercourse which are all on the Form One signed by the offender. 49 Taking all these matters into account, the appropriate sentence is one of eight years imprisonment as a fixed term.Seventh offence:50 This was a particularly disgraceful offence. The victim’s mother was away from the house a few days. Taking advantage of the situation, the offender bought some alcoholic drink and induced the victim who was 14 years of age to drink it. When she eventually stood up from her chair she had difficulty standing up. He then took her to a bedroom, laid her down on the bed naked and whilst naked he, told her to sit on top of him so that his penis was in her vagina. He then had sexual intercourse with her. A little later on she vomited.51 In my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of seven years imprisonment as a fixed term.Eighth offence52 This offence occurred in about April 1990. The victim’s mother was at home playing the piano and the offender was in the lounge at the opposite side of the house. He called the victim into the lounge room and when she arrived, she stood in front of him as he sat on a lounge chair. He grabbed her by the waist and turned around so that her back was to him. He sat the victim down on his lap and as he did this, he pulled down his underpants just far enough for his penis to be exposed. He then pulled down her underpants. His penis was erect and he pulled her down so that his penis entered her vagina. He held on to her waist and had sexual intercourse with her but did not ejaculate.53 In my opinion there should be a sentence of eight years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. This reflects the seriousness of the offence and it will enable his release at the end of eleven years if the parole authorities consider that he has taken serious steps to rehabilitate himself.The sentences:First offence:54 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of three years. That sentence will commence on 4 August 2007 and will cease on 3 August 2010. It is a fixed term.Second offence:55 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of four years. That sentence will commence on 4 August 2007 and will cease on 3 August 2011. It is a fixed term.Third offence:56 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of four years. That sentence will commence on 4 August 2008 and will cease on 3 August 2012. It is a fixed term.Fourth offence:57 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of five years. That sentence will commence on 4 August 2009 and will cease on 3 August 2014. It is a fixed term.Fifth offence:58 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of five years. That sentence will commence on 4 August 2010 and will cease on 3 August 2015. It is a fixed term.Sixth offence:59 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of eight years. That sentence will commence on 4 August 2010 and will cease on 3 August 2018. It is a fixed term.Seventh offence: 60 I sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment of seven years. That sentence will commence on 4 August 2011 and will cease on 3 August 2018. It is a fixed term.Eighth offence:61 I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of three years. That non-parole period will commence on 4 August 2015 and will cease on 3 August 2018. The balance of the term will go from 4th August 2018 to 3rd August 2023. The sentence will terminate on that day.62 I recommend that the offender be given the benefit of programmes dealing with sexual rehabilitation and that he be considered for release on parole at the end of his non parole period, but only if he has satisfied the authorities that he has made serious attempts to rehabilitate himself.

   SENTENCEIntroduction1 Ashadulhoque Bhuiyan is a most unfortunate man. He arrived in Australia from Bangladesh in November or December 1995 and within a few weeks of arriving, he asked Mr David Bitel, a well-known solicitor and human rights advocate, for assistance in having his claim to be a refugee recognised. Mr Bitel assisted him and ultimately he has been given permanent resident status.2 According to the evidence of Mr Bitel, which I accept, Mr Bhuiyan is a homosexual and faces persecution if he returns to Bangladesh. Unfortunately, he is also a chronic alcoholic, mentally ill and now a sex offender. He was born on 20th January 1978 and so is now a little over 30 years old. It seems quite evident that his mental condition is linked to his alcoholism, but both became evident only after a number of years. 3 Eventually, Mr Bitel became his carer and worked very hard to get him into rehabilitation facilities and to get housing and employment for him. As well, Mr Bhuiyan was getting psychiatric treatment, including admissions into psychiatric units in hospitals.4 In August 2005, he was living in accommodation in Yurong Street Sydney. Mr Bitel had also arranged this accommodation for him. Despite being on anti psychotic medication, Mr Bhuiyan continued to drink heavily and on the night of the offences was obviously very intoxicated, since, when arrested, he was unable to be interviewed for some hours.5 The background to committing the offences was that he spoke to the complainant, a prostitute working from the streets near Darlinghurst and agreed on the payment of a price for her services. She then went with him to his flat in Yurong Street, where he locked the door from the inside.6 He gave her the agreed money which she put in one of her socks. Both parties then stripped to nakedness and she put a condom on him, which he tore off and insisted, despite her protests and refusal, to have unprotected penile vaginal sex with her (first count) and then unprotected oral sex with her (third count). Before the oral sex he produced a knife and forced her to submit. She did so, only because she was afraid that he would cut her with the knife.7 The complainant was so terrified that when she managed to open the door and escape, she ran naked and screaming down the street until she met a man living nearby who took her in, calmed her down and called the police.8 The complainant had agreed for money to have sexual intercourse with the offender. However, she did not want to have it without a condom being worn by the offender. She was entitled to impose this condition on him, for her own protection from the possibility of getting or transmitting some type of disease.9 His forcing unprotected sexual intercourse on her was a serious crime. He had locked her in a room, she was defenceless and she submitted in the first place because of force and in the second place because of fear of being cut.10 Sex workers have the same rights as all other women to refuse to have sexual intercourse. The law protects their rights just as much as it protects the rights of all other women.Factors concerning sentence11 Section 23 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 requires me to indicate whether; if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.12 There is no doubt that if this had been a trial of a person who was tried for similar offences committed in similar circumstances, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment. 13 However, in imposing that sentence, I would have been required to take into account evidence of four principles enunciated in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at paras 33-36, i.e. 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Mental illness may be relevant … in three ways.  
        First 
        , where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced; there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced:

        Secondly

    14 Count 1 has a maximum sentence of 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. Count 3 has a maximum sentence of 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.15 However, when I impose a limiting term, I do not fix a non-parole period, but what is equivalent to the head sentence that would have been imposed on an offender who was fit for trial but suffering from a mental illness which did not excuse the offence. In my opinion, the standard non-parole period is of relevance because it indicates a minimum period which should be imposed on an offender following a trial for a medium range offence.16 Moreover, the fact that I must have regard to the standard non-parole period arises from the very wording of sec 23 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, since I would have to consider it if I were imposing a sentence on an offender who was convicted after trial if I determined the offence was in the middle range of seriousness.17 I do not consider these offences are in the middle range of seriousness because they involve forced sex on a woman who had entered into an agreement to provide oral and vaginal sex and was willing to do so, but only if the offender used a condom. She had been paid the agreed amount and took this with her when she left the flat of the offender. This could not be compared in seriousness to an offence where a woman who had not agreed to any sex at all and had sex forced on her, or to an offence where actual violence was used, as opposed to the threat of violence.18 It follows that if I were sentencing an offender at trial for these offences, whilst I would have regard to the non-parole periods, I would not fix the standard non-parole periods as the non-parole to be served by the offender.Other considerations  
     
      
       
      
    Rehabilitation19 If the offender were to receive the appropriate treatment, it would seem probable to me that he could recover from alcoholism and from mental illness. 20 Following the conviction, I placed him on bail for the purpose of assessing the possibility of rehabilitation. Unfortunately, on two occasions he was ejected from hospitals that were set up for the purpose of the treatment of alcoholism. Despite this, it is always possible that with appropriate treatment he will respond properly and become rehabilitated. I have a report from the Mental Health Review Tribunal which is of the view that he would be best treated in the community. 21 Part of my sentence will be to place him in the care of the Mental Health Review Tribunal and it will then be a matter for that tribunal to determine if it can arrange for his treatment in the community. I would not wish to express any opinion. 
    Other matters Character22 Between 1998 and 2003 the offender appeared before the Central Local Court and the Downing Centre Local Court on a number of occasions for summary matters of dishonesty and an offence of failing or refusing to undergo a breath analysis and for being an unlicensed driver. He has never been sent to prison before. He cannot be regarded as someone of good character but his offences are consistent with his being an alcoholic and a mentally ill person. The offences suggest that he had an aimlessness about him. If he receives proper treatment, it would seem to be probable that he would not commit such offences again. 
    Hardship in custody23 The offender will face hardship in custody greater than that experienced by many prisoners. The hardship will come from his being a foreign national who has a very confused understanding of his own national identity and few friends and no relatives living in Australia. He speaks and understands English but he will find the gaol environment very a difficult one. This is something to be taken into account in imposing a sentence on him.Intoxication24 The offender was very heavily intoxicated at the time he committed the offences. However, he was not so heavily intoxicated that he could not bargain with the complainant about the cost of the services, lock the door of the flat, pay her and threaten her. His intoxication may partly explain why he, a homosexual, would want sex with a female prostitute, but it does not excuse the offences, nor does it lessen the sentences which I must impose.Special circumstances25 I find special circumstances because this is the first time the offender has been in custody and because he is alcoholic and he is mentally ill and has shown an interest in rehabilitating himself.Range of Sentence26 In my opinion the sentence which I should impose for the first offence is a limiting term of three years. For the third offence, I consider there should be a limiting term of eight years. Both sentences should be concurrent and they will be backdated to commence from 2nd March 2008. I sentence the offender as follows: Count 127 I sentence him to a limiting term of three years. The term will commence on 2nd March 2008 and will conclude on 1st March 2011.Count 328 I sentence him to a limiting term of eight years. This term will be concurrent with the first tem. The term will commence on 2nd March 2008 and will conclude on 1st March 2016.29 I refer the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal and I order that the offender go into custody pending further order by that Tribunal. 30 I recommend that he be given urgent psychiatric treatment and counselling and treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.

      REASONS - Application to disqualify trial judge 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 1 April 2008, I heard argument from senior counsel for Moustafa Cheikho to disqualify myself on the basis of apprehended bias. This was asserted to arise from prejudgment on my part of issues that are likely to arise in this trial in relation to two specific questions. The pre-judgment was said to arise out of two decisions I gave during a series of pre-trial applications in the trial of one Faheem Lodhi. These decisions were given in February and April 2006.  
     
      
    2 The present trial concerns nine men who are each charged with conspiring to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. I am currently engaged on pre-trial issues in those proceedings.  
     
      
    3 On 31 March 2008, Mr Button SC indicated that he had instructions from his client to ask me to disqualify myself on the basis of the apprehended bias I have identified. The application was stood over until the following day when argument was heard. Although I had given a number of decisions during the last five weeks, I had been, on 31 March 2008, about to embark on the first of the evidentiary pre-trial applications in the present proceedings. This application arose out of the fact that the Crown wished to lead evidence at the trial that one of the nine accused, Moustafa Cheikho, had trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) training camp in Pakistan in September-October 2001.  
     
      
    4 Since that time, LeT has been proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the Australian government. The Crown case is that LeT provided training to a variety of terrorist groups and to individual Islamist extremists wanting to undergo jihadi training.  
     
      
    5 Moustafa Cheikho had filed a motion in November 2007 seeking, for relevant purposes, the determination of three pretrial issues. These were:  
     
      
       
      (1) an order that the evidence of the alleged activities of Moustafa Cheikho overseas be excluded.  
       
       
      (2) in the alternative, an order that the identification evidence relating to the alleged activities of Mr Cheikho overseas be excluded.  
       
       
      (3) an order that all witnesses against the applicant should give evidence in person. This would include the evidence of overseas witnesses involved in the identification process. 
       
      
    6 The first two matters I have mentioned involved questions as to the relevance in the trial of the overseas training alleged against Moustafa Cheikho; and required an assessment of the relevance and probative/prejudicial value generally of any evidence concerning LeT.  
     
      
    7 Secondly, there was likely to be an issue as to the exclusion of the mode of proof of identification. In this regard Moustafa Cheikho relied upon s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 NSW.  
     
      
    8 Alternatively, Moustafa Cheikho sought to exclude the evidence of identification under s 138 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    9 Finally, and this is said to be most relevant to the present disqualification application, there was likely to be an issue relating to the original interview between an ASIO officer and the identifying witness, Mr Kwon. In turn, this meant that the voir dire would be likely to focus on precisely what happened between the ASIO agent and Kwon at the meeting in November 2003.  
     
      
       
      The Lodhi Trial 
       
      
    10 Faheem Lodhi had been charged with a number of terrorism offences arising under the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act. One pre-trial issue in his trial related to the evidence proposed to be led by the Crown in that case that a person known as Willie Brigitte had attended training camps conducted by LeT in Pakistan in 2001. This evidence was sought to be led as relevant to an understanding of the nature of the military activities of LeT. Secondly, it was sought to be led to show that the same Mr Kwon I have mentioned earlier had been able to recognise from photographs a person he had trained with at Camp Masada in Pakistan. This person was known to him as Salahudin, but it was the Crown case that Salahudin was in fact the man Willie Brigitte.  
     
      
    11 The pre-trial judgment I gave on 13 April 2006 (R v Faheem Lodhi) related to an application made by senior counsel on behalf of Mr Lodhi that the photo identification of Salahudin by Mr Kwon should be excluded from the trial. There were two bases for this application. The first related to exclusion of the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act. The second basis on which exclusion was sought related to s 138 of the Evidence Act, or at least, by analogy, its application to a factual situation which had occurred in America at the time of the identification process.  
     
      
    12 The full facts of the matter are set out in the Lodhi decision I gave on 13 April 2006. There is no need for me to repeat the full details here.  
     
      
    13 Kwon was in an American prison in November 2003. He had agreed, however, to cooperate with the American authorities and had agreed to give evidence in a number of trials relating to the alleged terrorist activities of a number of other persons both in America and elsewhere. Ultimately, as the decision records, Kwon purported to recognise Salahudin from photographs shown to him by an ASIO officer. However, photographs of Willy Brigitte had already been shown by the FBI to Kwon prior to the interview with the ASIO officer. It was these unusual circumstances that led to the application to exclude the evidence under s 138.  
     
      
    14 The particular passage relied upon in this disqualification application appears in para 51 of my decision of 13 April 2006. It is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion the essential nature of the preinterview events, if I may call them that, is precisely as indicated by agent Ammerman. The ASIO officer was shortly to conduct an interview to obtain intelligence mainly as to whether Mr Kwon was able to identify (or more accurately recognise) any person he had trained with in 2001 in Pakistan. The American agency was making the witness Kwon available to ASIO for that very purpose. Although agent Ammerman adopted an unusual approach in showing the photographs to the witness prior to the arrival of the ASIO officer, he was, I believe, essentially assisting the Australian government in connection with an intelligence gathering operation. While it is true that the information obtained might have been of some interest to the FBI itself, that was, in my view, not the purpose of the operation in either of its aspects. I do not accept that the preinterview circumstances brought into existence the operation of the guidelines and I do not believe that the FBI agents were investigating the possible involvement of any persons in the photograph in a crime. They were doing no more than assisting a friendly foreign country by providing possible intelligence to that country's intelligence gathering organisation.""  
        
       
      
    15 (The guidelines referred to in this paragraph were the FBI guidelines contained in a document known as the Legal Handbook For Special Agents.) 
     
      
    16 Mr Button's main contention in the disqualification application was that the preliminary issues I have relevantly identified in the present trial will require the Court to examine with care exactly what was in fact happening between the witness Kwon and the ASIO agent. It will require rulings on the nature of what was really happening at the time of the interview and the intentions and activities of all the persons involved. Mr Button argued that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Court might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of that aspect of the questions to be determined in this pre-trial application. In other words, a fair-minded lay observer might think that the April 2006 judgment indicated prejudgment on the issues affecting the admissibility of the evidence against Moustafa Cheikho in this trial.  
     
      
    17 It is true, of course, that the pre-trial issues I have identified may require an examination of the circumstances surrounding Mr Kwon's alleged identification of Moustafa Cheikho; and that, in turn, will involve issues relating to the then state of mind of the ASIO representative, the FBI agents and perhaps Federal police officers as well.  
     
      
    18 To that extent, there is a degree of similarity between the April 2006 pre-trial issues determined in the Lodhi trial and those arising in the present matter. There are, however, substantial differences and I shall detail these at a later point in these reasons.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      The AVL order – a second basis for disqualification 
       
      
    19 On 27 February 2006, during the Lodhi trial, I made an order pursuant to s 15YV(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth). An application had been made by the Crown pursuant to Part 1AE of the Crimes Act 1914. This provided for the making of a video-link order in proceedings for terrorism and related offences.  
     
      
    20 The section is set out in full in the February 2006 decision I gave, as are the circumstances which ultimately justified the making of the order. The evidence to be taken by video-link included the evidence of Kwon and two FBI Agents. 
     
      
    21 I should mention that the order was made during a pre-trial application and it was limited to that situation. A number of the views expressed in the decision were, as a matter of necessity, preliminary only, since it was not known at that stage whether the defendant would oppose the making of such an order in the trial itself. In addition, there were extant a considerable number of pre-trial rulings which had the capacity to impact upon the extent of the evidence at trial. As things happened, a similar order was made during the trial but the making of that order was not contested by the defendant. Indeed, the Court at the request of Mr Lodhi, made orders that evidence from his family and friends in Pakistan be given by video-link. 
     
      
    22 In the present trial, the Crown, as I understand it, will be making an application that the evidence of certain persons, including the evidence of Mr Kwon, be taken by way of audio visual link. As I have indicated, this will be opposed by Moustafa Cheikho. It is for this reason that Mr Button has argued that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the decision to be made in the current proceedings ""would be informed to some degree by the previous finding"" in the Lodhi trial.  
     
      
    23 The Crown’s response to these two arguments was that I should not disqualify myself. The Crown argued that apprehended bias had not been demonstrated in relation to either of the two matters relied upon by Mr Button.  
     
      
    24 After hearing argument, I indicated on 1 April 2008 that I would decline to accept the invitation to disqualify myself. These are my reasons.  
     
      
    25 Before stating those reasons, I should indicate that there is no dispute between the parties as to the principles that are to be applied. The test is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the Court might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question that is to be decided on the relevant preliminary applications. (Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492 (11-12); Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy (2000) 205 CLR 337 at 350 per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; at 363 to 364 per Gaudron J; Smits v Roach (2006) 227 CLR 423; Livesy v New South Wales Bar Association (1983) 151 CLR 288 at 294.) 
     
      
    26 Mr Button, however, took me particularly to a passage in Livesy at page 300. This passage is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is, however, apparent that, in a case such as the present where it is not suggested that there is any overriding consideration of necessity, special circumstances or consent of the parties, a fair-minded observer might entertain a reasonable apprehension of bias by reason of prejudgment if a Judge sits to hear a case at first instance after he has, in a previous case, expressed clear views either about a question of fact which constitutes a live and significant issue in the subsequent case or about the credit of a witness whose evidence is of significance on such a question of fact.""  
        
       
      
    27 As I have indicated above, Mr Button suggests that, in particular, the April 2006 Lodhi decision contains, in paragraph 51, the expression of a clear view about a question of fact which is to constitute a live and significant issue in the present pre-trial proceedings.  
     
      
    28 I am unable to agree with this submission. First, the issue in Lodhi was the identification by the witness Kwon of Salahudin (""Willie Brigitte""). Here, the issue is the identification of Moustafa Cheikho as a person who trained at a LeT camp in late 2001.  
     
      
    29 Secondly, Salahudin was a person who was well known to the witness Kwon. They had trained together, lived together, and prayed together over a number of months. Here, as I understand the likely evidence, the man identified as Abu Asad (said by the Crown to be Moustafa Cheikho) was known to the witness Kwon for only a few days and then only relatively peripherally. They did not train in the same group and had no personal contact with one another. 
     
      
    30 Thirdly, the highly unusual situation that revolved around the FBI showing the photographs of Salahudin to Kwon before his interview with the ASIO agent will not, as I understand it, be replicated in the present preliminary application. In other words, on the limited understanding I have of the likely evidence, Kwon was shown a collection of photos of a number of people, one of whom he purported to identify as an Australian man who had trained at the camp with him. There had been no prior showing of this photo to Kwon. The situation is, as a consequence, quite different from the situation relating to the Willy Brigitte identification, or recognition, as it in fact was.  
     
      
    31 Fourthly, the paragraph in the April judgment which is said to constitute prejudgment represents a response to the principal submission made at that time by senior counsel for Lodhi in that pre-trial application. This was a submission that the actions of the FBI agents in showing the photograph to Kwon prior to the ASIO interview constituted a direct or indirect breach of the FBI guidelines and it was therefore, by analogy, an irregularity of the same or similar dimension to an irregularity under s 138 of the Evidence Act. The ""findings"" appearing in paragraph 51 were no more than a response to that submission. The full context of the surrounding paragraphs show this to be so. 
     
      
    32 Importantly for the fate of the application to disqualify, it is not presently the intention of Mr Button SC to argue that a breach of the FBI guidelines was involved in the photo identification by Kwon of the man Abu Asad. With his usual candour and fairness, Mr Button has made clear that he is at this stage not precisely sure what points will be taken in relation to the circumstances of the Kwon identification of his client. This will depend, in large part, on the answer or answers to subpoenas which have recently been issued to the Federal Police and ASIO.  
     
      
    33 It is clear, however, that one likely argument may be that what happened on the day of identification did so pursuant to some type of prior arrangement between the Federal Police and ASIO. That was not a submission that was made during the Lodhi pre-trial application. If it is to be made in the present matter, it will have to be dealt with, of course, on its own merits.  
     
      
    34 The statements I made in paragraph 51 of the Lodhi April 2006 decision do not prejudge (or for that matter deal with at all) any such submission. Nor do they attempt to evaluate evidence that might be raised of that kind.  
     
      
    35 Finally, on this point, I should make it clear that I made no findings in the April 2006 Lodhi decision as to either the credibility or reliability of Kwon or the FBI Agents. It was not my province to do so (see para 71 of the Lodhi decision) and I expressly refrained from doing so. 
     
      
    36 In relation to the February 2006 decision in which orders were made for the taking of evidence by video-link, Mr Button candidly accepted that the position here could not be said to be in the same position as that asserted in relation to the April 2006 decision. It is plain that any order made under s 15YV of the Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) must be made in terms of the mandatory nature of the section and having regard to the matters that are required to be proved by the legislation. Assuming those matters are proved, an order must be made unless the Court is satisfied that making the order would have a substantial adverse effect on the right of a defendant in the proceedings to receive a fair hearing.  
     
      
    37 Now, I simply have no idea of what matters might be raised by or on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho to suggest that such an order should not be made in the present case. Nothing has been identified to me in the written or oral submissions. When that application comes to be dealt with, I have no doubt that I will be obliged to give earnest consideration to any matter that may be raised either by Moustafa Cheikho or any of the other accused before I could be satisfied that the making of an AVL order would not have a substantial adverse effect on the rights of the defendants to receive a fair hearing. I do not consider that a fair-minded lay observer would conclude from anything contained in the February 2006 Lodhi decision, based as it was on the particular facts circumstances and arguments raised in that matter, that the Court might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the AVL question in the present matter. The fact that any such application might relate to the evidence of witnesses who gave evidence by video-link during the Lodhi pre-trial procedures has, in my view, no bearing on the matter. There was nothing related to the identity of those witnesses that had any bearing on the reasons for the decision being made. 
     
      
    38 I will conclude by making reference to two matters. The first is to Livesy's case itself. While I accept that the passage at page 300 to which Mr Button has drawn my attention is of general application, it needs to be recalled that the factual situation in Livesy was very different from the situation argued in the present matter, especially that based on the April 2006 decision. I will simply refer to the following passage at page 300:  
     
      
       
        
        “The central issue in the main charge against the appellant was whether the money which Ms Bacon lodged as bail was her own money. Two of the three members of the Court of Appeal, which was hearing the proceedings as a Court at first instance, had already held in a previous case that it plainly was not. Another central issue in the main charge was whether, if the money lodged were not Ms Bacon's, the appellant knew that this was so. Again, two members of the Court had held in the previous case that he clearly did...the question which arises is whether, in these circumstances, either the appellant or a fair-minded observer might have entertained a reasonable apprehension that the views which the two members of the Court of Appeal had formed and expressed in the Bacon case might result in the proceedings against the appellant being affected by bias by reason of prejudgment. With due respect to the members of the Court of Appeal who saw the matter differently, it follows from what we have said that we consider that question must be answered in the affirmative.""  
        
       
      
    39 Livesy was of course, decided twenty-five years ago. More recent judgments of superior Courts have emphasised that, in determining whether the test has been made out, proper regard must be had to the fact that the person who is being observed is a professional Judge, whose training, tradition, and oath or affirmation, require him (or her) to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial. (Johnson v Johnson at 493; John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v Kriss (2007) NSWCA 79.) 
     
      
    40 Secondly, as long ago as 1986, the High Court of Australia, conscious of the impact of the Livesy decision, cautioned against an increase in the frequency of applications by litigants that judicial officers should disqualify themselves on account of previous decisions or conduct during the litigation. (Re JRL ex parte CJL (1986) 161 CLR 342 at 352 per Mason J). His Honour said it was important that judicial officers should discharge their duty to sit and should not, by acceding too readily to suggestions of appearance of bias, encourage parties to believe that, by seeking the disqualification of a Judge, they might have their case tried by someone thought to be more likely to decide the case in their favour.  
     
      
    41 For these reasons I declined to disqualify myself.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of the murder of Jodie Hingston. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment (s 19A Crimes Act 1900). The standard non-parole period for the offence is 20 years imprisonment: (s 54A and 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). 
     
      
    2 Following his conviction the appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment, commencing on 27 July 2004 and expiring on 26 July 2024, with an additional term of 6 years and 8 months commencing on 27 July 2024.  
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. He appeared for himself in relation to the conviction appeal but was represented by counsel in relation to the matter of sentence. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 The facts are in a short compass. The appellant who was aged 30 at the time and the deceased, who was aged 26, had been living together at a boarding house in Redfern for approximately 6 days. They had been living in a de facto relationship for in excess of 6 years prior to that time. 
     
      
    5 The parents of the deceased gave evidence at the trial. Her mother said that in 2003 the appellant and the deceased resided with them for a period. During that time there were often arguments between the appellant and the deceased and on at least one occasion the argument was followed by the appellant chopping up Ms Hingston’s clothes.  
     
      
    6 Relations between Mr and Mrs Hingston, the appellant and the deceased deteriorated and they could no longer live together. The appellant and the deceased moved house, although Ms Hingston still kept in contact with her parents. In June 2004 the deceased arrived at her parents’ home bruised and bleeding. She told her mother that the appellant had punched her, held a knife at her throat and tried to strangle her. She told her mother that the appellant had accused her of playing up at the time when he assaulted her. Mrs Hingston took her daughter to the Royal Prince Alfred hospital the following day. The hospital notes read: 
     
      
       
        
        “Patient states boyfriend beat her from 9 pm to 2 am last night (ie 17 June). Punching mainly and scratches to neck with knife and scissors to superficial stab wounds on right arm and leg. No obvious precipitants to attack. Patient reports boyfriend has only slapped or given her a black eye before.” 
        
       
      
    7 Notwithstanding this incident the deceased resumed her relationship with the appellant. A short time later the deceased rang her mother in a distressed state. The appellant interrupted the conversation and said to Mrs Hingston, “She’s playing up on me” He went on to say, “If she ever does it again I’ll kill her.” Mrs Hingston said that the appellant spoke in an angry tone at the time. 
     
      
    8 Mr David Ironside also resided at the premises at the boarding house in Redfern. He was living there for about a week before Ms Hingston died. During that week he had several conversations with the appellant. The appellant told him that the deceased had been having an affair behind his back. The appellant said to Mr Ironside “I feel like strangling the bitch.” On the morning of 27 July 2004 the appellant came to Mr Ironside’s room and said, “David help me, I strangled the bitch. I caught her sucking some guy’s cock in the park.” (Although this was the evidence Mr Ironside gave at the trial he did not use the expression “the bitch” in his statement to the police. For this reason the trial judge was not prepared to find beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant used these words). 
     
      
    9 At about 3.55 am on 27 July 2004, which was prior to his conversation with Mr Ironside, the appellant rang 000 to report the incident. He told the operator “My girlfriend and I have had a dispute and I strangled her and she seems to be choking on her spew.” When the police and ambulance arrived at the premises, Sgt Reid asked the appellant to tell him what happened. The appellant responded “I strangled her.” 
     
      
    10 After he had been cautioned and arrested the appellant was taken to Redfern police station. While he was being searched the appellant asked, “How is she?” The police officer replied “I don’t know” and the appellant said, “I caught her playing up on me”. The officer asked “Who with?” and the appellant replied “some dog.” When the appellant was interviewed he spoke at length about the deceased’s alleged infidelity but denied strangling her. At that stage he declined to answer questions in relation to the assault. Later the appellant told another police officer “I didn’t mean to hurt her, just to scare her. She was sleeping with someone while I was away. How is she?” 
     
      
    11 In a later interview the appellant admitted strangling the deceased. He was asked how he was feeling at the time he was strangling her and he replied, “Not like I wanted to kill her, just like I want her to just, just, just to get out of my face. Not like I wanted to hurt her, just scare her.” 
     
      
    12 The autopsy found that the cause of death was a result of compression of the deceased’s neck. Blood samples taken from the deceased revealed the presence of codeine, lignocaine, morphine, nordiazepam and oxazepam. The drug lignocaine was administered by the ambulance officers but the other drugs were in the deceased’s blood stream at the time of her death. There was evidence that the presence of these chemicals would have impaired the deceased’s natural urge to breathe at the time when neck compression was applied to her. However, the forensic evidence was nevertheless that it was the compression of her neck which caused Ms Hingston’s death. 
     
      
    13 The deceased was 160 cm tall and her body weight was 54.5 kilograms. The appellant is 187 cm tall and at the date of the offence weighed 130 kilograms. 
     
      
    14 The issue at trial was the intent with which the appellant acted when he strangled the deceased.  
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    15 The appellant filed written submissions which are not entirely clear. However, the first three grounds of appeal raise for the consideration of this Court various evidentiary matters. They may be dealt with together and are expressed as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. that the conviction for murder is unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
      2. that the witness Ironside was not credible. 
       
      3. the evidence of the first police responders, Paramedic Marks and Dr Botterill who performed the autopsy, only support a conviction for manslaughter. 
       
      
    16 The appellant maintains the position taken by his counsel at the trial that he should have been found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. With respect to the issue of intention the Crown case relied upon admissions allegedly made to various witnesses including Mr Ironside. As I have indicated Mr Ironside’s evidence was that prior to the day on which the deceased was injured the appellant complained angrily about the deceased’s infidelity which was causing him stress and tension. He also spoke with Mr Ironside after Ms Hingston had died. 
     
      
    17 Although when cross-examined Mr Ironside was challenged as to the use by the appellant of the word “bitch”, the substance of the conversation was not challenged. It was suggested to him that the way in which the appellant had spoken when he said he felt like strangling the deceased was consistent with a person who was exasperated but not literally intending to kill her. 
     
      
    18 The appellant repeated his complaint about the deceased to the police. Although there was evidence that at times the appellant appeared upset and was trying to assist the deceased, when it was suggested that Const Knight observed the appellant to be distraught or in panic, this was denied.  
     
      
    19 The appellant submitted that given his emotional state, together with the evidence of the effect of the drugs which the deceased had taken and their consequence if her neck was compressed, the jury could not be satisfied that he had an intention to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Ms Hingston as opposed to an intention merely to scare her. He submitted that Mr Ironside’s evidence of what he told him was not credible because of the very short time they were known to each other.  
     
      
    20 There was evidence at the trial of a history of violence inflicted by the appellant on the deceased. There was also evidence that he was angry with her and he told one police officer that he had in fact “strangled her.” The identified cause of the violence was the appellant’s belief that the deceased had been unfaithful to him. The history of violence in the relationship and the appellant’s apparent obsession with his belief that the deceased had been unfaithful to him meant that it was open to the jury to conclude that the appellant had strangled the deceased in a jealous rage, with either the intent to cause her grievous bodily harm or, at the least, had acted recklessly. Although there was evidence that the various chemicals found in the deceased’s body may have inhibited her breathing reflex there can be no doubt that the constriction to her neck applied by the appellant was the cause of death. To my mind on the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of murder (see M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493). 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    21 The appellant complained that when summing up to the jury his Honour spoke about the offence of murder more than he did of manslaughter. There is no doubt that his Honour did this. However, it was inevitable. The substantive issue at the trial was whether the Crown could prove the necessary intention, before the appellant could be convicted of murder. Having reviewed the whole of the summing up I am satisfied that his Honour adequately and fairly explained to the jury the elements of both murder and manslaughter. 
     
      
    22 The appellant submitted that his Honour’s summing up was not balanced and complained in particular that he inferred in his summing up that Mr Ironside was a credible witness. In the course of his remarks his Honour reminded the jury that there was no issue that the appellant had told Mr Ironside that he had strangled the deceased. His Honour also reminded the jury of Mr Ironside’s evidence of the threats made by the appellant to the deceased and reminded them, in my opinion correctly, that Mr Ironside had been cross examined without any suggestion that his evidence was not essentially credible. His Honour also reminded the jury of the evidence of the conversation between the appellant and the deceased’s mother. To my mind these were appropriate matters to bring to the jury’s attention and his Honour did so in a balanced and fair manner. 
     
      
    23 His Honour was also careful to remind the jury, in the conventional manner, that they were the sole judges of the facts and should ignore any view of the facts which his Honour appeared to have unless that view coincided with the jury’s independent assessment. Having reviewed the whole of the summing up I am not persuaded that his Honour was unfair to the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The appellant could not instruct his solicitor fully or make life changing decisions as he was under the influence of “Seriquel” (600 mgs daily for approximately 18 months) 
       
      
    24 The transcript does not indicate any difficulty in the appellant instructing his counsel at trial. Although he was on medication there is no suggestion that for this reason the trial miscarried. The appellant does not provide any detail of matters he was unable to communicate to his lawyers or of any forensic difficulties which arose with the decisions made by his counsel during the course of the trial. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion each of the grounds of appeal fails and that the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    26 The appellant raises two grounds of appeal in relation to his sentence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in his assessment that the matter fell within the middle range of objective seriousness 
       
      
    27 The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder is 20 years imprisonment. The standard represents “an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness” (s 54A(2)). His Honour determined that the objective seriousness of the offence fell well within the mid range although at the higher end of that range. His Honour commented that if he had found that the crime had been premeditated he would have determined that it fell into a category beyond the mid range. He also said that if he had found that the appellant intended to kill the deceased he would have categorised the crime as falling beyond the mid range. 
     
      
    28 His Honour summarised his reasons for finding that the appellant’s culpability fell at least within the mid range in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) that strangulation is a particularly horrible way for a person to die. The process, as I have said, must have taken some minutes, minutes in which the deceased must have been terrified and suffering great pain; 
         
        (b) the prisoner had in the past threatened to do exactly what he did do; 
         
        (c) the vast physical difference between the prisoner and the deceased makes this a most cowardly crime.” 
        
       
      
    29 His Honour concluded that “in light of the threats he had made in the past and the vast physical difference between himself and the deceased, (the appellant) at least intended to cause her serious bodily harm when he placed his hands around her neck. My ultimate finding is that the prisoner intended to cause the deceased grievous bodily harm when he strangled her and that, as a consequence of his actions, the deceased died.” 
     
      
    30 The appellant challenges his Honour’s finding on five bases: 
     
      
       
      No intention to kill 
       
      
    31 It is apparent from the passages I have extracted that his Honour addressed the question of the appellant’s intention when he killed the deceased. The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider when determining the seriousness of the offence that the appellant did not have an intention to kill. To my mind there is no substance in this submission. It follows from his Honour’s finding of an intention to cause grievous bodily harm that his Honour did not find that there was an intention to kill. 
     
      
    32 In Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 Simpson J (at [49]) stated that the state of mind in which an offence is committed is a relevant consideration to the assessment of the criminality in relation to the offence of murder. However, her Honour stressed that it is not the only circumstance relevant to that assessment. Although where there is an intention to kill the objective seriousness of the offence is likely to be greater, it does not follow that where the intention is confined to an intention to cause grievous bodily harm that the objective seriousness will fall below the mid range (see Apps per Hunt JA at [4]). 
     
      
       
      Not premeditated 
       
      
    33 As I have indicated his Honour stated that if the offence had been premeditated it would fall into a category beyond the mid range. His Honour said that he would be of the same opinion if he had found that the appellant intended to kill the deceased. 
     
      
    34 It may be accepted that a murder which is not premeditated would usually be less serious than one which involves planning. However murder is a crime which can be committed under a very wide range of circumstances and the absence of premeditation does not dictate a finding that the objective seriousness of the particular offence falls below the mid range. 
     
      
       
      An immediate recognition of the potential harm caused, evidenced by his calling 000 
       
      
    35 The appellant suggested that his Honour failed to have regard to the fact that it was the appellant who telephoned 000 when he realised that Ms Hingston had been harmed. However, his Honour could not have overlooked it. His Honour provided an account of the telephone call in his remarks when he was describing the evidence relevant to his ultimate conclusion. 
     
      
    36 When assessing the objective seriousness of any offence the court is required to identify the relevant facts and form an intuitive judgment based upon the experience of the courts in sentencing for the particular offence. This is true of murder as it is of any other offence (see R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575; [2004] NSWCCA 434 at [13] and MLP v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 93; [2006] NSWCCA 271 at [33]. I am not persuaded that when identifying the matters which were critical to the decision that the offence fell within the mid range his Honour did not have regard to all of the relevant factors. 
     
      
       
      That no weapon was used 
       
      
    37 Section 21A(2)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  1999 refers to the actual or threatened use of a weapon as a potentially aggravating factor in a crime. However, the absence of a weapon does not mean that it is a factor in mitigation. His Honour was obviously conscious of the fact that a weapon was not used when he stated his view that strangulation is a particularly horrible way for a person to die. There are a number of weapons which the appellant could have used, including a ligature to effect strangulation. However, the fact that a weapon was not used and the assailant only used his hands does not mean that the offence is necessarily less serious. As his Honour said strangulation is a horrible way to die and in some respects made more horrible by the assailant using only his hands. 
     
      
       
      That the deceased was particularly vulnerable as her capacity to breathe normally was significantly compromised by the drugs she had voluntarily taken 
       
      
    38 The fact that the deceased had taken drugs which compromised her breathing was discussed during the course of the trial. In his remarks on sentence the trial judge referred to the evidence of Dr Botterill, the forensic pathologist, who identified the fact that although the deceased’s ability to breathe was inhibited by the substances found in her blood, “the fact of the matter is that they were not the cause of her death but that cause was the application of pressure on her neck by the prisoner.” His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I should add in this context Dr Botterill’s evidence that the neck compression applied necessary to cause brain damage would have lasted, at a minimum, four minutes. Even accepting that the deceased’s breathing ability was inhibited by the drugs she had ingested, the prisoner must have applied pressure to her neck for some minutes prior to her lapsing into unconsciousness.” 
        
       
      
    39 From these remarks it is plain that his Honour was conscious of the relationship between the drugs in the deceased’s blood and her death. However, accepting Dr Botterill’s evidence, the appellant nevertheless engaged in a continuous act of strangulation for a significant period of time. I can discern no failure by his Honour to have appropriate regard to the presence of drugs in the deceased’s blood when forming his conclusion as to the criminality involved. 
     
      
    40 The appellant submitted that by reason of each of the matters to which I have referred and cumulatively, his Honour fell into error. In my opinion that submission must be rejected. I am satisfied that his Honour had regard to all of the evidence and made an appropriate determination as to the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: His Honour erred in his assessment that there were not reasons for setting a shorter non-parole period than the standard non-parole period 
       
      
    41 The appellant submitted that there are many cases where, although a sentencing judge has determined that the offence falls within the middle range (or above) of objective seriousness, the subjective factors justify a non-parole period less than the standard period provided by the statute. It was submitted that in this case the appellant’s subjective features justified such a decision. This court has repeatedly warned against comparing the circumstances of individual murders when sentencing a particular offender. In R v Slater (2001) 121 A Crim R 369; [2001] NSWCCA 65 at [52] Spigelman CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this area, prior cases of this character are a guide and are likely to be a more useful guide than the Judicial Commission’s sentencing statistics. However, murder is a crime which can be committed in a wide range of gravity and objective circumstances. There is also a significant range of differences in the subjective circumstances. This is a context where the maximum penalty is life and, accordingly, the range over which the sentencing discretion can be exercised is the largest open to a judge in our justice system.” 
        
       
      
    42 The appellant referred to a number of previous decisions where there were circumstances justifying a departure from the standard non-parole period. However, there is no principle which emerges which required the sentencing judge in the present case to provide a non-parole period less than 20 years. The matters referred to by the appellant were 
     
      
       
      (a) the hardships suffered by the appellant in his youth; 
       
      (b) his remorse; 
       
      (c) that the offence was not planned or organised; 
       
      (d) his prior criminal record and that this would be his first gaol sentence; 
       
      (e) that he is unlikely to reoffend; 
       
      (f) his prospects of rehabilitation given his age and in particular:- 
       
      (g) the degree of pre-trial disclosure; starting with the 000 call, the subsequent admissions and the way the trial was conducted. 
       
      
    43 Each of these matters was referred to by the judge in his remarks on sentence. Following his Honour’s discussion of them he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have said, Dr Bishop relied upon a number of mitigating factors set out in s 21A of the Act. I should add that, in relation to the question of rehabilitation, he submitted that the prisoner would require a longer than usual period of rehabilitation having regard to the difficulties he suffers from as outlined in the report from the psychologist Mr Dawes. However, applying what fell from the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        Way  
        [ 
        R v Way  
        (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; [2004] NSWCCA 131] I am of the view that the matters averted to by Dr Bishop in his submissions as to the applicability of s 21A do not dissuade me that this is a case where the standard non-parole period should be applied. In my view, the objective features to which I have referred so outweigh the matters properly raised by Dr Bishop in mitigation that I therefore propose to apply that standard non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    44 In R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575; [2004] NSWCCA 434 at [13] Simpson J usefully summarised the propositions which emerge from the decision in Way. Her Honour’s summary is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) while s54B(2) requires, in sentencing in respect of an offence to which Division 1A applies, unless the sentencing court determines that there are reasons not to do so, that it set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence, that obligation exists where the offence in question is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that kind; one reason permitting departure from the standard non-parole period is that the offence in question falls outside the middle of that range (para [67]); 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the standard non-parole period was intended for a middle range case where the offender is convicted after trial: a plea of guilty might be in itself a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period (para [68]); 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) a sentencing judge will be required, in relation to any given case, to hypothesise what is an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in order to determine where the subject offence lies in relation to such an offence; such an exercise is, in reality, little different from the traditional sentencing exercise of evaluating objective seriousness of any offence, and should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts in sentencing for the particular offence (paras [74] – [77]); 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of any offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the  
        actus reus 
        , the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the  
        mens rea 
         of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness (paras [85] – [86]); 
        
       
       
        
        (v) that an offence is “typical” or “common” does not dictate that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (para [101]); 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) the numerical frequency with which an offence of a particular kind is committed is not an indicator of the objective seriousness of any individual instance of that offence: (paras [101] – [102]); 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) where a court determines that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the standard non-parole period nevertheless remains of relevance in the sentencing determination, as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost (para [122]); see also  
        R v GJ Davies 
         [2004] NSWCCA 319. 
         
         
        Finally, it is to be observed that there is nothing in Division 1A that compels a court which finds that an offence is in the mid range of objective gravity to fix the standard non-parole period in respect of that offence. Possible reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period are extensive, as s21A makes clear.”  
        
       
      
    45 It was to these principles that the sentencing judge referred. Although another judge may have come to a difference conclusion I am satisfied that the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge was within his Honour’s discretion. No error has been revealed.  
     
      
    46 Although I would grant leave to appeal against sentence I would dismiss the appeal.

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: 1. John George is a numismatist. Numismatics is the study or collection of coins, tokens, paper money and related objects such as medals. Mr George was in possession of one of the top collections west of the Blue Mountains. For safekeeping the collection was stored in a safe located in a spare bedroom in his Brewarrina home. 2. On 3 July, after arranging with a nearby neighbour to feed his dogs, Mr George left Brewarrina for Lismore. The house was left with windows and doors securely locked. The coin and paper money collection was nestled safety in the locked safe. The safe was heavy. Without a trolley, it would take two persons to move that safe. 3. At 4pm on 5 July a neighbour attending the premises gave the dogs a run. He noticed everything was fine. About 8am the following morning he returned to find a small kitchen window smashed, the back screen door lock broken and the shed doors opened. He became concerned and rang police. By 10am Mr George had been informed his home had been broken into; it had been completely ransacked and the safe and its contents were missing. 4. As events had unfolded, it became apparent that two juveniles and two adults, all aboriginal males, were responsible for the breaking, entering and ransacking of Mr George’s home and stealing of his property. 5. Today David Nicholls, at eighteen, the second eldest of this group, is to be held accountable for his role in this criminal activity. He first announced his intention to be accountable when he pleaded guilty in the Local Court in Brewarrina. He confirmed his intention when he pleaded guilty to an indictment presented on Tuesday, 1 April, to a charge that he on 5 or 6 July 2007 at Brewarrina did break and enter the dwelling house of John George situate at 16 Tarrion Street, Brewarrina and then in the said dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was in the company of one RB, one CB and Cecil McHughes. 6. As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions, as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this court committed by this offender, harming the victim that he did in this community (Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]). My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires the sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. 7. My fact finding task has been circumscribed to some extent in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court, a judge is not a party to the agreed facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve a judge from his fact finding responsibility, it simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed to not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it. 8. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made, there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether this offence attracts a standard non-parole period and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. 9. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have, as its primary focus, the protection of the community, will also need to be determined (see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740). Further facts: 10. Entry was gained by smashing a kitchen window. One offender initially entered the house, opened the rear door from within and the other three then entered. At some point the alarm had been cut near the telephone. 11. This offender remained in the house for some five minutes before taking an esky and leaving the premises with one of the juveniles. The offender claims he took the esky with a view to using it. He concedes he knew there were items in the esky but did not identify them. I reject this account. 12. Mr George stored that esky in a sunroom near the fridge. It is likely the esky was empty when it was stored. Ultimately, the esky was found in the middle of a shed on property occupied by Lynette Fazeldene. That property was situate in Culgoa Street, Brewarrina. In the esky were two glass jars and a Kodak camera box, probably relating to a camera that was stolen. 13. This offender lives at Narran Street. He had taken, he said, the esky for his own purposes. If that were so, it is more likely the esky would not have been with all the items found at Culgoa Street. I am satisfied the esky was loaded with items to be taken from the property. This offender was tasked with removing the esky and its contents from the premises. 14. The offender claims he did not see the safe in the premises. Given that some of the contents of the safe were found in the same location as the esky was found, I have serious reservations about accepting that evidence. 15. The agreed facts concede that at the time of his departure the two adult offenders were searching the master bedroom. The agreed facts contain the following:  
     
      
      At the time this offender left RB and McHughes were searching the master bedroom. This offender then attended Shane Orcher’s house a number of streets away. (I have difficulty with that but it is an agreed fact. It does not explain the fate of the esky.)  
       
       
      Police allege that RB and Cecil McHughes completely ransacked the premises, scattering items throughout the kitchen, lounge room and master bedroom. RB and McHughes took a number of items from various locations from within the house, including a Kodak vintage instamatic camera, (coincidentally, the camera box is found in the esky) two watches and other assorted items.  
       
       
      RB and McHughes removed a grey coloured CMI wall safe positioned on the floor in the master bedroom. This safe contained:  
       
      A large pre-decimal coin and paper money collection worth $116,774.50, including a rare 1930 penny and a rare square penny; A large assortment of extremely valuable, rare and antique coins; An Australian pre-decimal paper bank note collection; Various war service medals in the name of the victim’s father, M Hegarty, a returned service medal, (presumably in the name of the victim’s grandfather, J M Hegarty) and other commemorative coins.  
       
       
      RB and McHughes forced entry into the rear shed and took from within it a 1993 Suzuki TF 185 motor bike and a blue Makita brand grinder. RB and McHughes also took a red wheelbarrow located leaning against the northern fence. RB and McHughes took the safe and motor bike to 9 Culgoa Street, Brewarrina. (It would seem that they had some assistance in doing that from others not involved directly in the break in, including someone driving a utility. ) 
       
       
      During the morning of Friday, 6 July 2007, RB and McHughes forced entry into the safe. RB and McHughes removed the rear wheel of the motor cycle before storing it in a shed at 9 Culgoa Street, Brewarrina.  
       
       
      On 12 July 2007 police recovered a number of coins and documents relating to the coin collection. They were later identified by Mr George and returned to him. On the same day Mr George located his wheelbarrow at a vacant house block on Wilson Street, (which, as I understand, is a street nearby his premises at Brewarrina,) 200 metres east along Wilson Street from his own house.  
       
       
      On Friday, 13 July a search warrant was executed at 10 Barwon Street, Brewarrina. Police located a single silver coin later identified by Mr George as belonging to him. That coin was returned to him.  
       
       
      On Tuesday, 17 July 2007 Lyn Crowley, owner/manager of the Cash and Carry Store, Brewarrina, noticed and returned a number of assorted Australian currency coins to Mr George. She had accumulated these coins via means of transactions at her store. Ms Crowley indicated she identified the coins via conducting afternoon checks of the till and did not know who supplied any of the specific coins. Mr George identified some of the coins as belonging to his collection previously contained in the safe. (The portions in paranthetical brackets not submitted as part of agreed facts). 
      
    16. I note that if any of them were in mint condition when taken their being used in commercial transactions would have destroyed that classification for those coins and consequently their value.  
     
      
      On Monday, 23 July 2007 police divers located the door of the CMI safe in the Barwon River underneath the Barwon River Bridge, on the Kamilaroi Highway on the northern town exit. On inspection, police could see the lugs of this door had been ground off and the handle was missing. Police had received information that the safe had also been deposited in the Barwon River.  
       
       
      On Thursday, 26 July 2007 police conducted a search of 9 Culgoa Street, Brewarrina. An occupier’s notice was served on Lyn Fazeldene who, as I understand it, was the occupier of those premises. Police located:  
       
       
       ·  
         
       Various documents pertaining to the coin collection and numerous pieces of plastic, casing from the missing Australian currency coin collections in the rear yard and inside three rear sheds;  
        
       ·  
         
       The missing yellow Leisure brand esky and the missing Kodak camera within these sheds;  
        
       ·  
         
       A green coin album containing a collection consisting mainly of pennies, including the 1930 penny missing from the collection underneath a box behind one of these sheds. My memory is the square penny worth $40,000 was also found at that site;  
        
       ·  
         
       A lug 
         
       ground off the safe door and a metal handle consistent with the door handle for the safe on the ground near the sheds;  
        
       ·  
         
       The missing Suzuki motor bike in one of the rear sheds. 
        
       
      
    28. All of these items were seized by police. A large portion of the rare coin collection is still outstanding. The value of the unrecovered portion of the coin/paper money collection is said to be in the region of $18,000. Perhaps of more significance, the war medals of a World War II soldier and the returned service medal of a World War I corporal in the Gunnedah Rifles is still missing. 29. Seven weeks after the burglary David Nicholls volunteered himself to the police at Brewarrina Police Station and made admissions as to his involvement in the offence. He participated in an ERISP in which significant admissions were made by him and the investigator’s knowledge of the identity and movements of the burglars was either confirmed or revealed. 30. By 27 July, that is a week before his surrender, police were certainly interested in one of the juveniles. This offender was the first to be arrested. He attended the police station in company with another person, a juvenile, who had some connection with the offence, although on the facts before me it is not clear what. Other arrests followed. Two of the offenders have pleaded guilty. One is to come before the Local Court on 6 May. The other alleged offender has been committed for trial in this court. Objective criminality: 31. From the facts, as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in what is called the “instant offence”, that is the offence I am dealing with, with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence is evaluated. The objective criminality has a very important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 32. The criminal justice system places great store upon the sanctity of a person’s home. For example, police and other government authorities must seek a court’s permission, in the normal course of events, before they enter even the most humble person’s abode. Any analysis of section 112 and 113 of the Crimes Act, that is the sections dealing with offences of which breaking and entering are an essential element, would yield the inescapable fact that these sections focus upon the crime of breaking and entering the personal space of the occupant as one aspect of a two pronged crime. In this case, the second aspect is the intent to commit the felony, larceny. 33. The offence of larceny prosecuted on indictment carries a maximum penalty of five years. If one breaks and enters a person’s home, that maximum penalty nearly triples to fourteen years. The aggravation of the larceny, if I can put it that way, to merit a maximum penalty of fourteen years occurs because of the store that the law puts on the importance of the sanctity of a person’s home. If one does that in company with other people, that fourteen year penalty rises to twenty years. So that if one breaks into somebody’s home in the company of others for the purpose of stealing, instead of facing a maximum penalty of five, the maximum penalty becomes four times greater, amounting to twenty years. 34. In a well known English case of Brewster [1998] 1 C.A.R. 220 at 225 the presiding judge made these observations:  
     
      
      “Domestic burglary is and has always been regarded as a very serious offence. It may involve considerable loss to a victim. The loss of material possessions is only part and often a minor part of the reason why domestic burglary is a serious offence. Most people perfectly legitimately attach importance to the privacy and security of their homes. Should an intruder break or enter for his dishonest purpose, that leaves the victim with a sense of violation and insecurity. Even where a victim is unaware at the time that the burglar is in the house, it can present as a frightening experience to learn that a burglary has taken place.”  
      
    35. The same case made the point that a victim may lose possessions of particular value to him. A coin collection and particularly the collection of medals of family heroes would, of course, be matters of great importance and of historical importance to a victim. 36. In this case there are features suggesting some thought went into the burglary. There were two dogs on the premises. No one makes any comment as to how it was they did not raise an alarm. The dogs were in the yard. The burglary extended from beyond the house to a shed in the yard. On its own, the silence of the dogs, or the apparent silence of the dogs, does not amount to much because the dogs may have been old or friendly but it is a disturbing feature that they did not raise the alarm. 37. The burglary occurs at a time when the occupant was away for several days. The ransacking of this house, the search for and means of taking the safe, an angle grinder, a motor cycle, from the premises all took time. This offender limits his time in the premises to five minutes. Five minutes for a burglar is quite a substantial time but the two adult offenders were there for a substantially longer period. A kitchen light was switched on. A search of the shed, separate from the house, was conducted. Three items of substantial size, a motor cycle, a safe and wheelbarrow, were removed. All of this is consistent with a confidence that the burglars would not be interrupted. 38. This offender denies any prior knowledge of the offence prior to his joining his co-offenders at about 11pm. For him it was an opportunistic crime, starting with one of the juvenile offenders, borrowing his jumper, presumably to wrap around his hand as he smashed the kitchen window. I cannot see any other purpose for the borrowing of that jumper, even though it was a winter’s night. This offender says that the juvenile gave him his jumper. It does not make much sense to me. 39. The damage to the window and the damage to the door aggravate this burglary. 40. There was a ruthless thoroughness to the search for booty. The house was ransacked and left in chaotic disarray by the burglars. That constitutes an aggravating feature of this burglary. 41. The value of the goods taken may well have amounted to something in the order of $125,000. The coin and paper collection, as I said, was valued at $116,000. While it is unlikely the burglars had any idea of the value of items taken, indeed the owner valued his collection at only $40,000, nonetheless a measure of criminality is the real value of items taken. Money value is one measure of the real value but to the owner the sentimental, aesthetic and historical value are also of importance. 42. The loss of war medals belonging, presumably, to his father and grandfather may well represent a greater loss than their money’s worth. The high value of the goods taken consequently amounts to an aggravating feature. Fortunately, much of the permanency of that criminal damage has been mitigated by the police recovery of many of the stolen items. 43. A feature of this case is the burglars’ crass lack of appreciation of the aesthetic, historical and emotional significance of a collection of this quality, together with the war medals. Such is the reverence numismatists would have for items in this collection that they would have worn special gloves to handle them. For these offender’s, what coins they could not spend were strewn about the yard and shed with total disregard to their collective quality. 44. While I have made this observation, I have not added this ignorance to the criminality I am dealing with. 45. This offender’s role in the burglary is one of the lesser roles. He did not damage the windows or the door. As the evidence stands, it cannot be said he searched for anything or ransacked or dishevelled the house. He appears to be the mule who takes an esky containing booty from the premises and starts it on its journey to Culgoa Street. He was not one of the planners, nor a leader. 46. The feature of aggravation relied upon as an element of the offence is one of “being in company”. That there were four intruders would more than fulfil this element and on that basis may amount to some degree of aggravation. However, the feature itself of “being in company” is a less menacing and hence less criminal feature on its own overall impact of the seriousness of the offence than other features of aggravation, such as being armed with a prohibited weapon or using corporal violence or depriving the occupier of liberty ( R v Huynh [2005] NSW CCA 220). The fact that empty premises were targeted rather than premises where someone was known to be present also has an impact on the seriousness of this offence, that is to say it would be less serious because there was no occupier present. 47. The Crown has conceded the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. I have indicated some evidence that could suggest the contrary but at the end of the day the concession by the Crown appears to be fairly made. 48. Having regard to the objective facts, the Crown submits that this section 112(2) offence should be placed at the lower range of possible like offences. My own view is that the offence itself should be regarded as more substantial than at the lower end of the range. However, it may be the Crown is really submitting this offender’s objective criminality in this aggravated burglary is towards the lower end of the range. If that is the import of his submission, then I agree with it. 49. I would not, on the objective facts, regard this offender’s criminality as reaching a mid range of seriousness. As is noted, it falls towards the lower end of the range. Subjective features: 50. I turn now to the subjective matters; I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but I am also sentencing this particular offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender, or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. 51. This offender is a single, eighteen year old aboriginal male. Currently he is not in a relationship. He claims to be shy but apparently has expressed an interest in a Dubbo based girl. Since this incident, he lives and works in Castlereagh, near Penrith, where he lives with his mother and step-father. His own father lives in Brewarrina. At the time of his offending, David Nicholls was living in Brewarrina, as I understand it with his Auntie Liz Layland. Education, employment and skills: 52. David Nicholls did his early schooling at St Mary’s. While at high school, he started to get into trouble fighting. He claims it was because others were racist towards him. He was not achieving well in grades either, I suspect. Ultimately, he was expelled from that school. 53. He came to Brewarrina to visit his dad. He completed Year 10 in Brewarrina. He got part time, unskilled work with the CDEP. After this offence he returned to the Penrith area. He secured employment with Muru Mittigar in September 2007 and has remained with them, working fulltime, as a fixed term team member. His tasks with Muru Mittigar include land rehabilitation, wood working and integrating with the public in cultural tourism and associated catering. He has undertaken some training, including a KEM certificate, learner-driving skills. His supervisor says he has established a high level of respect among the visiting public, business associates and other staff members because of his commitment to a job well done. 54. It would appear his employers take their responsibility as employers of this young man seriously. They appear to be fostering an interest in on the job training and financial management of his wages. Their occupational health and safety policy has a “Fit to Work” program requiring employees to submit to random blanket drug and alcohol testing. During his time at Muru Mittigar he has participated in and provided consistent negative results. 55. He has an interest in aqua golf that hopefully he will take from the aqua driving range to the golf course. It is likely he may have natural golfing skills. He is considering returning to study at TAFE. He should be encouraged to do so. At eighteen, he is on the threshold of adulthood that would be made richer and more absorbing for him with some further education. Education would also help advance his career and, perhaps, the opportunity of presenting himself as a model for other young aboriginal men. General health: 56. At eighteen, David Nicholls presents as a healthy young man. There is nothing in his physical health profile that suggests he should have any difficulty rehabilitating. Mental health: 57. There is nothing before me suggesting any mental health problems that would cause issues with his capacity to rehabilitate. Drug and alcohol issues: 58. This topic was not covered very fully in evidence. What is apparent is that prior to his offending conduct there were issues relating to drugs. He had been smoking marijuana on the day of the offence. My sense is that he had been using marijuana regularly and over a substantial period. However, since the offence he has ceased used marijuana. That is confirmed by the random testing earlier referred to. 59. His alcohol consumption does not presently appear to be a problem, whether it was prior to the offence is unclear. Character and antecedents: 60. David Nicholls is but eighteen. His character has barely had time to formulate. Since his offending he has taken steps to advance his rehabilitation. He has secured employment and ceased with cannabis. He has an interest in sports. He is well regarded at his workplace and, it would seem, among his family, he claims strong family support. He appears to be developing skills useful, both at the workplace and life outside work. 61. He has a father who presents as a role model in that he was a man who initially had problems with drink but is now employed in charge of a security patrol and is no longer plagued by alcohol problems. 62. His aunt is a co-ordinator for the Circle Sentencing in Brewarrina. These are role models who demonstrate Aboriginal people have important contributions to make in our society. Hopefully, Muru Mittigar is teaching this offender the same lesson and providing him a pathway to also contribute to our society in a valuable and constructive way. 63. Many Aborigines coming from Bourke before this court have histories of offending starting in the Children’s Court. David Nicholls, prior to this offence, had never been in trouble with the police or the courts. Attitude to the offence: 64. Initially the offender sought to take advantage of his offending conduct by commandeering the rear wheel of the stolen motor cycle for his own vehicle. As the police began searching, I am satisfied he became conscious of his criminality and the likelihood that his involvement would ultimately be discovered. Unlike some of the others, he decided to be accountable for his offending conduct. He surrendered himself to the police and gave an account of his role. Initially it was not a full account. Subsequently, he returned and told police about his role with the esky and motor cycle wheel. I still have some reservations as to whether a complete account has been given but it is likely most of what occurred has been ventilated by him. 65. He says he regrets his involvement; I accept he does. He seems, at some level, to be able to empathise with Mr George’s loss, particularly of the war medals. He has given a written undertaking which is exhibited before me that he will assist with the further investigation and prosecution of the matter. As matters presently stand, that may require him to give evidence in this court against the oldest of the alleged participants. He may also be called upon to give evidence in the Local Court. 66. Given it is unlikely to be disputed that there was a breaking, entering and stealing at Mr George’s home, he will become a crucial witness in the Crown case against any alleged co-offender. It is likely a jury, properly instructed, will be satisfied that he was present at the scene, that he knew the identity of others at the scene. The issue for the jury will be whether he is honest and accurate in placing the relevant accused at the scene. 67. His credibility will necessarily be tarnished because of his failure to reveal at the first interview his role with the esky, and the motor cycle wheel if that was not done at the first interview. He is also likely to have his credibility further tarnished because of his lack of frankness about his reasons for taking the esky from the house. 68. On the other hand, he has given an account which the Crown can forcefully argue is basically correct. His presence in the prosecution case gives that case a strength previously lacking. 69. It is likely some members of the community, including his co-offenders, will resent his action in giving evidence. He will have to wear their disapprobation which may build to violence or threatened violence. On the other hand, it would seem police had already received some assistance from unidentified members of the community who will respect this offender for the courage it takes to accept accountability for his offending conduct and to assist the authorities bring to account other alleged co-offenders. Plea of guilty: 70. This plea was indicated in the Local Court; it was a plea early entered. My understanding is that the indictment was required simply to address some anomaly in the charge. 71. But for the plea of guilty, I would have set an overall sentence of eighteen months imprisonment for this offence. I have discounted that by twenty-five per cent, that is four and a half months, making a total sentence of thirteen and a half months. 72. The benefit that I intend to give for the assistance will not be given as a discount. Rather, I will apply it by changing the nature of the sentence from one of fulltime custody to one of a suspended sentence. 73. There are other factors that have also impacted upon my decision to suspend the sentence, including: He has no prior offending conduct, hence it would be with some confidence that I would expect him to keep the section 12 bond; His rehabilitation has progressed since the offence and would be best achieved in the community based setting, particularly if possible involving his present employer; At eighteen, it is appropriate he has a sentencing disposition that gives greater weight to rehabilitation than to punishment or deterrence. Parity: 74. The juvenile RB has been convicted and sentenced by the Bourke Children’s Court to a seventeen month control order with a non-parole period of ten months. This was subject to a severity appeal which is presently part heard before me. It has been stood over to 6 June when it is anticipated he will be placed on a section 33(1)(c)(ii) bail for twelve months. In the event he successfully rehabilitates, the existing control order will be suspended. 75. RB was one of the leaders and initiators in this crime. He has a substantial criminal history, even though he is still a juvenile. 76. David Nicholls’ role is much less; his criminal antecedents are, to this point, untainted. Of course, Nicholls is being sentenced pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He has also been given some benefit for the assistance given to police. 77. In all of these circumstances, strict parity does not apply (see R v Lovelock (1998) 19 ALR 327).Setting the sentence: 78. The maximum penalty for this offence, as earlier mentioned, is five (as said) years with, in appropriate cases, a standard non-parole period of five years. Standard non-parole period: 79. When reviewing the objective features, I indicated this offender’s criminality fell below the mid range of seriousness. Having reviewed the subjective features, including the plea of guilty, the assistance to prosecution and investigation and the lack of prior criminal history, this offence falls outside the mid range of seriousness. 80. In any event, the standard non-parole period usually only applies to the evaluation of criminality after trial ( R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168). The fact that a suspended sentence is being imposed also has its own statutory provisions in respect of setting a non-parole period. (See s12 (3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.)Custodial history:81. This offender has spent no time in custody in relation to this offence.  Deterrence: 82. I have considered the issue of deterrence. As earlier remarked, this offender is being sentenced as an adult. Usually greater weight is given to the concept of rehabilitation. Nonetheless, as was given in evidence yesterday, he has been arrested, interviewed by police, been before the Local Court, been before this Court, heard his conduct condemned by a judicial officer of this Court and has had all of that hanging over his head since 24 August 2007. Answers he gave yesterday indicate that these matters act as a deterrence for him. He is also to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which will appear on his record until he dies. That should also be a feature of deterrence for him. The sentence of imprisonment itself will be deterrence for him, indeed it will be personal deterrence because, in the event that he should re-offend within the next thirteen and a half months, he will stand to be sentenced with a sentence the quantity of which he will know, namely thirteen and a half months imprisonment. The Sentence 83. David Nicholls, you are convicted that you, on 5 or 6 July 2007 at Brewarrina, broke and entered the dwelling house of Mr John George situate at 16 Tarrion Street, Brewarrina and in that dwelling house did commit a serious indictable offence, namely larceny, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that you were in the company of a juvenile RB, another juvenile CB and Cecil McHughes. 84. For that offence, I sentence you to thirteen months, fifteen days imprisonment. 85. I will, upon condition that you enter into a bond pursuant to section 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to be of good behaviour, suspend that sentence. I would imagine that you would want to do that but I must formally ask you if you want to and you had better just have explained to you quickly by your counsel the consequences if you breach your bond. OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour, I’d like to enter the bond.HIS HONOUR: You want to enter the bond? OFFENDER: Yeah. HIS HONOUR: All right. The bond will have these conditions, that you will be of good behaviour. Do you know what that means? OFFENDER: Yep. HIS HONOUR: What does it mean?OFFENDER: I’m not allowed to do nothing bad and get in trouble with the police. HIS HONOUR: That is a broad way of putting it but includes getting into a fight, which you have a bit of propensity for, at least at school. It may mean driving without a licence, because I do not think you have one yet. It may mean smoking cannabis. And it certainly would mean doing something like this again. Now, you have to be of good behaviour for how long? OFFENDER: Thirteen and a half months.HIS HONOUR: So, if we start today and we are in the month of April, when are you likely to finish this bond? OFFENDER: May of next year.HIS HONOUR: Late May next year. So, how long have you got to stay out of trouble for? OFFENDER: Thirteen and a half months.HIS HONOUR: Until late May, next year. Not that I am encouraging you to get into trouble after that but this is meant to demonstrate to me and to the community that you will stay out of trouble. 86. The offender has indicated that he is willing to accept the conditions of the bond which are that he be of good behaviour, that he give to this court his current address and that he answer any call up in the event that he is to be found or alleged to be in breach of the bond. 87. I do not, as presently advised, intend to have him supervised. I would like to see him stay in the present job he is in, they seem to me to be very good. Mr Crown, do you want to be heard on the question of supervision? MAY: No, your Honour, I don’t.HIS HONOUR: Mr Rickard?RICKARD: No, your Honour. HIS HONOUR: I am sufficiently impressed with you not to require you to be supervised. Supervision actually provides resources. They are pretty pressed, I do not think you need the resources but that puts a greater responsibility on you, not a lesser one because if I happen to be wrong about that, you cannot come back to me later on and say, “Oh, you should have put me under supervision and I should have got help.” You are going to have to do this on your own, do you understand? OFFENDER: Yeah. HIS HONOUR: The bond can be entered before the registrar. 0O0

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 3 March 2008, the trial of Dror Salah and Ezra Salah commenced before a jury upon a charge that, on 5 August 2006, at Bondi Beach in the State of New South Wales each did murder Hernan Dario Guelman. On 10 March 2008, Dror Salah pleaded guilty to manslaughter and Ezra Salah pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact to manslaughter. The Crown accepted each plea of guilty in satisfaction of the indictment and the jury was discharged. 
     
      
    2 Following a sentencing hearing on 13 March 2008, the proceedings were adjourned until today for sentence to be passed upon each offender. 
     
      
       
      The Offences 
       
      
    3 An agreed statement of facts was tendered at the sentencing hearing. In addition, I have had regard to aspects of the evidence of witnesses given during the trial which were touched upon in submissions. The following account is drawn from the agreed statement of facts, except where reference is made to the transcript of evidence of particular witnesses. 
     
      
    4 The two offenders are brothers. Dror is 33 years old and Ezra is 32 years of age. Both are Israeli nationals as was the deceased, Mr Guelman. 
     
      
    5 The deceased was 38 years old at the time of his death. He lived at Bondi and frequented the Zinzana Café, which was located in Glenayr Avenue near the intersection with Curlewis Street, Bondi. 
     
      
    6 During the late morning of 5 August 2006, the deceased and Dror had an altercation in a shop in Hall Street, Bondi. During the argument, the deceased offended Dror by calling him “an Arab”. The deceased threatened to kill Dror. The two men left the shop and crossed the road. As they approached the opposite kerb, the deceased punched Dror in the side of the head. They kept walking and the deceased pulled Dror’s hair and tried to punch him again. At about that point, they were in the vicinity of Dror’s car, a small red Mitsubishi. Dror pushed the deceased’s head into the windscreen of the vehicle, cracking the windscreen. 
     
      
    7 After this incident, Dror drove to his home in Vaucluse. He related the incident to his partner, Michelle Stratford. She observed swelling on Dror’s nose and a cut between his nose and left eye. He also had a bleeding thumb, but no blood on his clothes. These injuries were confirmed by a subsequent medical examination. 
     
      
    8 Dror left his home for several hours and returned in the late afternoon. He left the house that evening after receiving a call from Ezra, informing Ms Stratford that someone was threatening him and the family and the business and that he was going to see his brother. 
     
      
    9 Shortly after 9.00 pm, the deceased walked into the Zinzana Café. Dagan Arazi was seated at a table with his friend, Ilan Tzemach. The deceased appeared anxious and angry and told Mr Arazi about the earlier incident. Also in the café was Faig Nisanov. The deceased told Mr Nisanov that he would kill the Salah brothers. Mr Nisanov left the Zinzana Café and walked down Glenayr Avenue away from the intersection of Curlewis Street and Glenayr Avenue, Bondi. Mr Nisanov saw Dror driving a green Mitsubishi Pajero along Glenayr Avenue heading towards the Zinzana Café. Ezra was in the front passenger seat of the Pajero. Mr Nisanov told Dror and Ezra that the deceased was looking for them (T331) and confirmed that the deceased was at the Zinzana Café. 
     
      
    10 Dror drove past the Zinzana Café and he and Ezra looked into the café. The deceased ran into the kitchen of the café and grabbed a red-handled Victorinox knife. The deceased came out of the café with his hands under his shirt. Moshe Kahlon, the proprietor of the Zinzana Café, told the deceased to cross over Curlewis Street, but the deceased walked towards the intersection of Glenayr Avenue and Curlewis Street. Mr Arazi observed the deceased get the knife from the kitchen. Mr Arazi saw Dror and Ezra in the Pajero near the Zinzana Café. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Arazi ran to the passenger side of the vehicle and warned Dror and Ezra with words to the effect “He just go to the kitchen, grab a knife, just get out of here” (T255) although the evidence is unclear as to whether the passenger window was open at the time. 
     
      
    11 Dror turned the Pajero left into Curlewis Street. He reversed slightly and then pulled in towards the kerb in Curlewis Street just outside the Glenayr Convenience Store. Mr Arazi ran to the Pajero and gave a second warning to Dror and Ezra, saying “Get out of here” in Hebrew (T256). 
     
      
    12 Soon after, at about 9.39 pm, the deceased walked the short distance to the intersection and turned left into Curlewis Street, so that he was immediately outside the Glenayr Convenience Store. He approached the Pajero. There was an altercation between the deceased and Ezra where the deceased closed the passenger door on Ezra’s hand causing a fracture. Ezra left the Pajero and the deceased cut his hand with the knife. Subsequent medical examination confirmed a fracture to Ezra’s right hand and an approximately three-centimetre wound to the left hand. Forensic examination of the Pajero confirmed the presence of Ezra’s DNA profile on the inside of the front passenger doorframe.  
     
      
    13 Dror left the Pajero, carrying a length of metal vacuum cleaner pole, in an effort to go to the assistance of Ezra. The vacuum cleaner pole most likely comprised two extensions joined together. The deceased brandished the knife at Dror and tried to stab him. Dror hit the deceased on the head and body with the vacuum cleaner pole at least four times, pushing him back towards the wall of the convenience store. Part of the vacuum extension came loose and fell onto the ground as Dror struck the deceased. This part remained at the scene and was recovered by police who attended within minutes of the Salahs leaving the scene. 
     
      
    14 Dror grabbed the knife from the deceased. In doing so, he sustained a 28 mm “y-shaped” laceration between the thumb and forefinger of his right hand. This injury was confirmed in a subsequent medical examination.  
     
      
    15 Dror then stabbed the deceased six times in a struggle. Five of those stab wounds were to the front of the deceased’s body, in the area of his left chest, upper right thigh and left leg. The sixth wound was in the back upper-left abdomen. Two of those wounds were immediately life threatening. One stab had punctured the aorta, and another cut the femoral artery. The latter cut caused immediate and massive bleeding, pooling at the deceased’s feet. Dror stepped back and the deceased collapsed to the ground. Dror picked up the knife and pole from the ground. Ezra and Dror ran to the Pajero and Dror drove off. The pole was located later by police in the Pajero. 
     
      
    16 The deceased was close to death as he lay on the footpath in Curlewis Street. He had suffered massive blood loss. An ambulance arrived within minutes. The deceased was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital, Darlinghurst, arriving at 10.05 pm. Surgery was undertaken. The deceased had suffered cardiac arrest from multiple stab wounds and active bleeding from the right groin. An unsuccessful attempt was made to repair the large femoral artery which had been completely transected. Following surgery, massive blood transfusions continued. However, the deceased did not improve and treatment was withdrawn. He died at 4.10 am on 6 August 2006. The pathologist who conducted a post-mortem examination concluded that the deceased died from shock and haemorrhagic complications arising from the six stab wounds. 
     
      
    17 After leaving the scene of the stabbing, Dror drove the Pajero to nearby Gilgandra Road, North Bondi. The vehicle was left there due to mechanical failure. Dror threw the knife in a nearby storm drain, but it was caught in the grate of the drain. At about 7.00 pm on 6 August 2006, police located the Pajero in Gilgandra Street, North Bondi. Shortly after 7.50 pm, police located the bloodstained Victorinox knife at the top of the storm drain on the southern side of Gilgandra Street about 50 metres west of its intersection with Niblick Street.  
     
      
    18 After leaving the Pajero in Gilgandra Road, North Bondi, Dror returned to his house in Vaucluse. Ms Stratford put the bloodstained clothes of Dror and Ezra in a plastic bag, which was placed in a spare room. The clothes were later recovered by police from a vehicle in which Ms Stratford was a passenger. At the time, Ms Stratford was acting on Dror’s instructions to take the clothes to the police station. 
     
      
    19 Dror handed himself in to police at about 7.00 pm on 7 August 2006. In a recorded interview conducted that evening, Dror admitted involvement in the fatal altercation but denied that he had stabbed the deceased. He gave an account of events earlier in the day. Ezra handed himself in to police at about 1.10 pm on 8 August 2006. No interview was conducted by police with Ezra. 
     
      
    20 Both the Crown and senior counsel for Dror submit that this is a case of manslaughter by way of excessive self defence: s.421(2) Crimes Act 1900. By his plea on this basis, Dror admits that, at the time of the fatal stabbing, he intended to inflict (at the least) grievous bodily harm to the deceased. The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years: s.24 Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    21 The liability of Ezra as an accessory after the fact to manslaughter is based upon his leaving the scene of the stabbing immediately with Dror, his non-disclosure of the whereabouts of the Pajero and the bloodstained pole used in the offence and his giving to Dror for disposal Ezra’s bloodstained clothes which might be linked to the offence. Ezra’s assistance continued until the clothes and vehicle were retrieved by police in the two days following the fatal incident. 
     
      
    22 The maximum penalty for being an accessory after the fact to a serious indictable offence (in this case, manslaughter) is imprisonment for five years: s.350 Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    23 Dror has been in custody since 7 August 2006. Ezra was taken into custody on 8 August 2006 but, as will be seen, his custodial history since then has involved a combination of prison custody or immigration detention whilst on bail.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances of Offenders 
       
      
    24 As mentioned earlier, Dror is an Israeli national. The Court was informed that he holds permanent residence in Australia. According to the Crown, Dror will most likely be deported upon the expiration of any non-parole period to be fixed for his offence. 
     
      
    25 On 9 June 2000, in Sydney, Dror was fined $150.00 for possession of a prohibited drug. Apart from that conviction and what was said to be a minor earlier offence in Israel (which the parties submitted ought be disregarded), Dror has no criminal history.  
     
      
    26 A number of references were tendered on Dror’s behalf which attested to his good reputation, in particular, in the Israeli community in Sydney’s eastern suburbs. At the time of the present offence, Dror was conducting a bakery business at Bondi in which, according to the evidence, he had worked hard for some time prior to the offence. Ms Stratford, Dror’s partner of six-and-a-half years, provided a reference supportive of him. 
     
      
    27 According to other evidence (Exhibit 3), the parents of the offenders live in Israel. The offenders’ 58-year old father was present at the time of the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    28 Ezra first entered Australia on a tourist visa on 19 February 2002. 
     
      
    29 Thereafter, Ezra remained in Australia on a range of visas, the last of which expired on 17 November 2006 (Exhibit 1). He was charged with murder and remanded in custody where he remained from 8 August 2006 to 28 May 2007. In May 2007, he was discharged on the charge of murder following committal proceedings and was committed for sentence to this Court on a charge of common assault. The Crown did not proceed with that charge in this Court. 
     
      
    30 On 20 November 2006, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued a State Criminal Justice Stay Certificate for the purpose of s.148 Migration Act 1958 (Cth) which certified that the stay of the removal or deportation of Ezra, then an unlawful non-citizen, from Australia was required for the administration of criminal justice by the State of New South Wales.  
     
      
    31 From 29 May 2007 to 2 August 2007, Ezra was held in immigration detention at Villawood. From 3 to 28 August 2007, he was held in prison custody, I infer following the bringing of an ex-officio indictment in this Court charging him with murder. Following a grant of bail by a Judge of this Court on 25 August 2007, Ezra has been, from 28 August 2007 to the present time, on bail subject to a condition that he reside at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre, where he was bound to be held (if not in prison) given his status as an unlawful non-citizen.  
     
      
    32 On 6 November 2000, Ezra was convicted of assault in Israel and was ordered to perform 150 hours’ community service as well as being subject to a six-month suspended sentence. Ezra and two other persons assaulted the victim in an incident arising from a motor vehicle accident in June 2000.  
     
      
    33 A number of references were tendered on behalf of Ezra testifying to his general reputation and character, especially in the Israeli community in Sydney.  
     
      
    34 As I have mentioned, the Court has been informed that Dror is likely to be deported from Australia upon the expiration of any non-parole period. Given the status of Ezra as an unlawful non-citizen, it may be taken to be likely (at the least) that Ezra will be deported from Australia at the completion of any non-parole period that may be fixed. The fact that Dror and Ezra are likely to be deported is irrelevant as a sentencing consideration: Shreshtha v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 48 at 71. 
     
      
    35 Neither Dror nor Ezra gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
      Determining Appropriate Sentences 
      
    36 Courts have observed that a wide range of conduct may be encompassed by the offence of manslaughter. I am satisfied that Dror’s offence of manslaughter is an objectively serious one. I accept the Crown submission that it fits into the more serious category of manslaughter by way of excessive self-defence. The following considerations lead me to that conclusion: 
     
      
       
      (a) Dror had been involved in a verbal and physical altercation with the deceased earlier on 5 August 2006 (the evidence in the sentencing proceedings does not permit any clear finding concerning the reason for the altercation) - Dror was aware that the deceased had expressed ongoing hostility towards him after that altercation - he chose to return to the area expecting further contact with the deceased that evening; 
       
       
      (b) having driven into Glenayr Avenue, Dror was warned by Mr Nisanov that the deceased was at the Zinzana Café - nevertheless, Dror drove on to the vicinity of the Zinzana Café; 
       
       
      (c) Mr Arazi approached the Pajero containing Dror and Ezra and gave them a warning concerning the presence of the deceased with a knife; 
       
       
      (d) rather than driving away from the scene, Dror drove the Pajero around the corner into Curlewis Street where it came to a halt - at about this time, Mr Arazi came to the passenger side of the vehicle and gave a further warning to Dror and Ezra concerning the deceased; 
       
       
      (e) Dror still did not drive away from the scene down Curlewis Street - it is possible that the deceased, by this time, had moved to the front of the Pajero thereby obstructing the vehicle - nevertheless, Dror made no attempt to lock the vehicle and drive from the scene at that time; 
       
       
      (f) a physical altercation occurred between the deceased and Ezra involving the fracture of Ezra’s hand, although the evidence does not indicate with any clarity how Ezra’s passenger-side door came to be open; 
       
       
      (g) Dror left the driver side of the vehicle with the piece of vacuum cleaner pipe to come to the aid of his brother - the evidence does not reveal how the pipe came to be in the Pajero although it was a light piece of metal which was not likely to operate as a very effective club in a fight; 
       
       
      (h) by this time, the deceased was holding the knife and had attempted to strike Ezra - Dror struck the deceased over the head with the metal pipe a number of times as the deceased attempted to stab Dror with the knife; 
       
       
      (i) Dror took the knife from the deceased - Dror took control of the situation in this way - the deceased was then unarmed - Dror stabbed the deceased five times in various locations in the chest and groin area and once in the back - although Dror’s physical involvement with the deceased in the incident commenced in the context of his defence of Ezra, then defence of himself from attack by the deceased, once Dror had taken the knife from the deceased, he savagely attacked the deceased with multiple stab wounds being inflicted including two wounds which were life threatening; 
       
       
      (j) having attacked the deceased in this way, Dror took the knife and part of the metal pipe, returned to the Pajero and fled the scene - by that time, the deceased was lying on the ground and it was apparent to Dror, I am satisfied, that the deceased was bleeding profusely - Dror did not remain to assist; 
       
       
      (k) the Pajero was left in Gilgandra Street, North Bondi and Dror attempted to dispose of the knife by throwing it into a storm drain - but for the fact that the knife was caught in the grate, the knife may have disappeared into the drain. 
       
      
    37 The plea of guilty to manslaughter was not entered at an early stage. Having regard to the timing of the plea, I propose to allow a 10% discount for the plea. I am not satisfied that Dror has demonstrated remorse for his offence for the purposes of s.21A(3)(i) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Reference to telephone contact by Dror with others after the attack does not demonstrate remorse on Dror’s part. 
     
      
    38 Senior counsel for Dror submitted that aspects of the conduct of the deceased may be considered to be provocative, and thereby a mitigating circumstance, for the purpose of s.21A(3)(c) of the Act. Although the physical and verbal altercation earlier in the day, combined with the evidence of verbal insults directed by the deceased towards Dror and Ezra shortly before the fatal incident, provides some context for what followed, I do not consider that it constitutes provocative conduct of a kind which mitigates Dror’s offence. 
     
      
    39 I have regard to the fact that Dror has been in custody since 7 August 2006 and that, to date, he has been held in protective custody on remand. The Court was informed that the reason for his protective custody related to Dror’s Israeli nationality and possible interaction with prisoners of other ethnic backgrounds. I accept that protective custody involves greater hardship than ordinary custody. For the future, following sentence, Dror will be classified. It would be speculative to take into account the prospect of future protective custody in circumstances where that may or may not arise.  
     
      
    40 I am satisfied that special circumstances exist for the purpose of s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    41 I have been referred to other sentencing decisions for manslaughter in the course of submissions. Comparison with sentences in other cases must be undertaken with caution: R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505. To the extent that cases involving manslaughter by excessive self-defence provide some assistance, I am assisted most by R v Cakovski [2005] NSWSC 1001 and Ahmad v R [2006] NSWCCA 177. 
     
      
    42 Having regard to the objective circumstances of the offence, the subjective circumstances of the offender and the purposes of sentencing under s.3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I consider that the appropriate sentence for the crime of manslaughter in this case is imprisonment for eight years and nine months with a non-parole period of five years and nine months, with both to commence on 7 August 2006. 
     
      
    43 In passing sentence on Ezra, I keep in mind that he is to be punished for the offence for which he has pleaded guilty, namely accessory after the fact to manslaughter, an offence punishable by a maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment. Other Judges of this Court (Studdert J in R v Abdulrahman [2007] NSWSC 578 and Howie J in R v Walsh and Sharp (2004) 142 A Crim R 140) have commented upon the inadequate penalty provided by s.350 Crimes Act 1900, in particular where the offence is one of accessory after the fact to manslaughter. The legislature has not chosen to act following these judicial comments. I have regard to the maximum penalty for the offence as it stands in the legislation. 
     
      
    44 In my view, this was an objectively serious offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter. I accept that, at the time when he accompanied Dror into Glenayr Avenue on the evening in question, Ezra was aware of the altercation between Dror and the deceased earlier in the day. I accept that Ezra heard Mr Nisanov’s warning that the deceased was at the Zinzana Café. I accept that Ezra heard Mr Arazi’s first warning concerning the deceased when the Pajero was in the vicinity of the Zinzana Café. Although Ezra was not driving the vehicle, there is no evidence to suggest that Ezra urged Dror to drive away from the scene to avoid a confrontation. Ezra has not given evidence in the sentencing hearing, nor did he provide a recorded interview to police. Accordingly, there is limited material before the Court to explain how the passenger side door came to be open. The evidence points to the deceased injuring Ezra’s hand and the deceased attempting to strike Ezra with the knife. Ezra was present when Dror struck the deceased with the metal pipe, took the knife from him and stabbed the deceased in the manner described above. It would have been apparent to Ezra that the deceased had suffered multiple substantial wounds, causing great loss of blood. Ezra did not remain at the scene to assist the deceased or otherwise, but left with Dror in the Pajero. Ezra gave his bloodied clothes to Dror. His assistance to Dror no doubt resulted from his relationship as brother. The evidence does not point to Ezra being other than a willing supporter and assister of his brother. 
     
      
    45 Ezra’s presence at the time of the fatal stabbing is an aggravating factor on sentence: R v Hawken (1986) 27 A Crim R 32; R v Do (NSWCCA, 7 May 1997) per Gleeson CJ at page 4. I derive little assistance from reference to other sentences for accessory after the fact to manslaughter given the small number of cases involved and their varying circumstances. I keep in mind, of course, that Ezra is to be sentenced for the offence to which he has pleaded guilty, and that the relevant objective facts in support of that offence relate to his assistance to Dror. Nevertheless, as I have said, his presence at the time of the fatal attack and the circumstances in which he came to be present are relevant, in my view, to the question of sentence with respect to the offence for which he is before the Court.  
     
      
    46 I propose to allow 10% by way of discount for his plea of guilty. I am not satisfied that Ezra has demonstrated contrition which may be taken into account as a mitigating factor on sentence: s.21A(3)(i). Ezra has a prior conviction for an offence of violence in Israel, and this tempers evidence before the Court concerning his general reputation and character. 
     
      
    47 I propose to take into account Ezra’s pre-sentence prison custody. I will allow some credit for his period in immigration detention (which is referable to this prosecution), although it is not to be equated to prison custody. 
     
      
    48 Ezra was held in protective custody whilst he was in prison for the same reason as Dror. I take that into account in determining sentence. As I observed with respect to Dror, it would be speculative to have regard to the custodial status of Ezra after imposition of sentence. 
     
      
    49 Having regard to the objective circumstances of Ezra’s offence, his subjective circumstances and the purposes of sentencing under s.3A, I consider that the appropriate sentence to be imposed on Ezra comprises imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of one year and 11 months to date from 8 August 2006. In reaching this conclusion, I have found special circumstances for the purpose of s.44 of the Act. 
     
      
       
      Sentences 
       
      
    50 Dror Salah, for the crime of manslaughter, I sentence you to imprisonment for eight years and nine months with a non-parole period of five years and nine months, with both periods to date from 7 August 2006. 
     
      
    51 Ezra Salah, for the crime of accessory after the fact to manslaughter, I sentence you to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of one year and eleven months, with both periods to date from 8 August 2006. For the purposes of s.50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I make an order directing the release of Ezra Salah at the completion of his non-parole period on 7 July 2008.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender Kirrlie Wilson was convicted by a jury of the charge of murder. The offence arose from the death of a man named Ric Anson in his bedroom in the early hours of 11 January 2005. Two co-offenders, William Spencer and Owen Frazer were convicted of the offence of manslaughter arising from the same incident. Spencer was sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of 9½ years and Frazer to imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years. 
     
      
    2 The facts are fully set out in the sentencing remarks for Frazer and Spencer and need not be repeated in the same detail for the purposes of sentencing this offender: see [2007] NSWSC 1449. Mr Stewart on behalf of his client argued that I should find facts consistent with the jury verdict but as they most favoured the offender. With respect, that is not the law. Although it may be possible to construe the verdict of the jury in a way that does not involve a positive finding that the offender was the person who shot the deceased, it is highly technical and very unlikely that this was what the jury found. True it is that the Crown did not assert whether the offender or Frazer shot the deceased. But the Crown did not have to do so in order to make out its case. The fact that the jury convicted the offender of murder but Frazer of manslaughter is in my view consistent only with their having found that the offender fired the weapon. 
     
      
    3 The deceased was a person engaged in trafficking in drugs. He had shortly before his death come into possession of a large amount of money as a result of an armed robbery committed by him. Spencer learned of this fact and determined to have it stolen from him. For this purpose Spencer contacted the offender and arranged that they would meet outside the townhouse in Toronto where the deceased resided and where Spencer had been staying. Spencer was to use his key to allow the offender into the premises. However, earlier in the evening on which the robbery had been planned the deceased was acting in a threatening manner and was brandishing a firearm. He was apparently affected by drugs. Spencer told the offender of this incident and warned him to be armed. 
     
      
    4 Sometime on the evening of 10 January or the early hours of the next morning the offender went to the home of an associate named Frazer and asked him to assist. Frazer agreed to go with the offender no doubt to supply physical support in order to intimidate the deceased to hand over the money. The offender asked his nephew, Sales, to drive him and Frazer to the deceased’s premises telling him they were going to obtain drugs from the deceased. 
     
      
    5 Shortly before arriving at the townhouse the three offenders met at Lake Munmorah, this offender and Frazer were in a vehicle driven by Sales. Spencer was in another vehicle with his girlfriend. After a short discussion they proceeded independently to the townhouse with this offender in constant contact with Spencer by mobile phone. They met outside the premises at about 4am and Spencer let the offender and Frazer inside. Spencer then left the immediate vicinity of the townhouse. 
     
      
    6 The two men confronted the deceased during which two shots were fired from the gun with which this offender was armed. One struck the deceased in the forehead. The evidence was that the deceased was sitting on the side of his bed before he was shot. He bore injuries which indicated that he had been pistol whipped and had defence injuries to his arms. 
     
      
    7 Immediately after the shooting the two men left the premises and returned to the vehicle in which Sales was waiting. When they arrived there, the offender apologised to Frazer for what had happened saying, “I’m sorry, Owen. I fucked up. I’m so sorry.” He repeated this several times. It is obvious that they did not achieve their objective in obtaining money from the deceased. 
     
      
    8 During the investigation of the killing, police spoke to the offender in a recorded interview. The offender denied any involvement in the killing and gave a somewhat nonsensical account of his activity at the time apparently intending the police to believe that he had been affected by drugs to such an extent that he had been in an hallucinatory state at the relevant period. 
     
      
    9 During the trial the offender gave evidence, as did Spencer and Frazer. In effect their version was that Spencer had set up a drug deal between the deceased and the offender and that was why they went to his home in the early hours of the morning. It was the offender’s evidence that neither he nor Frazer had been armed when they entered the premises. The deceased had been paranoid and took offence at the presence of Frazer. He threatened the offender with a weapon and a struggle ensued during which the firearm accidentally discharged. It is obvious that the jury rejected this account. 
     
      
    10 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the factual scenario surrounding the killing that I have already recounted. I have no doubt that the jury convicted the offender of murder because they concluded that he was the person who shot the deceased. Clearly they were assisted in reaching that decision by the admission by the offender that he had been responsible for the shooting of the deceased albeit rejecting his version of how that had occurred. I have no doubt that the offender was the person contacted by Spencer to carry out the robbery, that he had enlisted Frazer to assist him in that venture and that he was armed when he attended the premises. 
     
      
    11 I also find to the same standard that the offender had been assaulting the deceased with the weapon shortly before it was fired. It is clear from the nature of the fatal injury that it was inflicted at very close range, that the offender intended to kill the deceased when he fired the weapon. Although Mr Stewart submitted that I did not have evidentiary material to find that the accused was assaulting the deceased at the time, he could give me no other factual alternative that was in accord with the evidence. I am willing to find that the accused lost his temper with the deceased and as a result fired the weapon. This seems to me to be a finding that favours the offender to a degree otherwise in light of the closeness of the weapon to the deceased’s forehead when it was fired it was a cold-blooded execution-type killing. 
     
      
    12 This was an armed robbery that went wrong. The offender did not intend to kill the deceased when he went to the premises. However this was still a grave case of murder even though the killing was not planned. The activity leading up to the killing was seriously criminal, involving as it did a planned armed robbery of a person in his own home using a loaded firearm. I can only presume that the offender and Frazer were expecting to be paid for what they were to do. However they were hired to commit a robbery not a killing. 
     
      
    13 The offender is aged 32. He has a relatively minor record dating from 1992 including some assaults and weapon offences. He has spent short periods in prison serving sentences. Considering his very difficult background it would have been no surprise had his record been worse. He was for a while a user of amphetamine but gave that up about 8 years ago. He was selling the drug as a means of earning some income at the time of the shooting. 
     
      
    14 The offender and his elder brother gave evidence before me consistent with the background information set out in a report prepared by a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore. The offender’s brother was a particularly impressive witness who appeared quite distressed when speaking of the conditions in which the offender was brought up. He lived in very deprived circumstances as a child and was subject to considerable violence inflicted upon him by his stepfather. Some of his siblings were taken into care but not the offender and thereafter he took the full the brunt of the violence in the home. The offender completed schooling until year 9 by correspondence. He worked for his father mining opals until leaving home at the age of 16. Thereafter he worked in various manual type positions. 
     
      
    15 He was in a relationship for seven years as a result of which he had four children. The relationship ended because his partner was neglecting the children through drug usage. For a period he lived and worked in Coffs Harbour but returned to the Central Coast because his former partner wanted his assistance. He then fell into the drug culture in which he was engaged at the time of the present offence. 
     
      
    16 There is little doubt that the offender’s background has left him with personality problems but it is to his considerable credit that he was able to overcome his use of drugs and largely avoid serious conflict with the law, especially so far as offences of violence are concerned. However he has recognised problems with anger and has undertaken two courses while in custody to address them. I feel that his tendency to anger was involved in the shooting of the deceased. 
     
      
    17 The offender gave evidence supported by documents that after the shooting of the deceased he made efforts to improve his situation in life. By his own efforts he became involved with a company called Active Industry Training and underwent a six-week course to obtain qualifications that he hoped would assist him to obtain employment. He completed that course and another one in November 2005 and obtained proficiency certificates in carpentry and construction. In February 2006 he obtained employment with Borg Manufacturing as a factory hand. 
     
      
    18 The offender was arrested In May 2006 and has been in custody since then. He has contact in prison with a half brother who is being held as a forensic patient. The offender works as a sweeper in the prison and has not been the subject of any disciplinary action. He writes to and contacts his brother who is offering him what support he can. 
     
      
    19 The offender has expressed remorse for the killing in that he accepts that had he not been there it would not have happened. He states that it brought him to his senses about the life he was leading at the time. He accepts the jury’s verdict even though he does not acknowledge that it was correct as he maintains the version that the shooting was accidental. I am prepared to accept that he is unlikely to re-offend in so far as his use of firearms is concerned but much will depend on his situation when he is eventually released from prison. He has shown signs of maturity and will no doubt continue to do so over the period of his incarceration. It is difficult to come to any firm view about his prospects of rehabilitation given the period that he must serve before he can be released. But there is nothing to indicate that the protection of the community is a current concern or will be a concern in the future. 
     
      
    20 Unfortunately for the offender there is an applicable standard non-parole period of imprisonment for 20 years. There are clearly aggravating factors in the use of the weapon, it was committed in company and in the deceased’s own home. I note that amendments to s 21A that commenced in January of this year do not apply because the offender had been convicted before that date (see Schedule 2 of Act 50 of 2007). But they would have been aggravating features under the common law in any event. There is some remorse although not for that part of the offence involving the robbery of the deceased. As I have indicated little regard could be had to any prospect of rehabilitation although I acknowledge there were signs of the accused trying to rehabilitate and for which he deserves both commendation and consideration. 
     
      
    21 The Crown submitted that overall the standard non-parole was appropriate and achieved parity with his co-offenders. I believe that the offence is slightly higher than midrange in seriousness but having regard to the offender’s attempts to rehabilitate before his arrest, especially in light of his disadvantaged upbringing, I am prepared to impose the standard non-parole period. It must be said that having regard to the criminality of the co-offenders it seems slightly unfair that this offender is to spend twice as long in prison. However that is the consequence of the co-offenders’ extreme fortune in being convicted only of manslaughter chiefly as a result of the Crown eschewing felony murder and the standard non-parole period applying to this offender where there is no standard parole period in the case of manslaughter. 
     
      
    22 Although there might have been a basis for finding special circumstances had the offender’s crime been of much less seriousness, there is in my opinion no basis to reduce the non-parole period having regard to the period that the offender is to spend on parole as a result of the application of the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of the term or for any other reason. 
     
      
    23 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 20 years and a balance of term of 6½ years. The sentence is to commence on 19 May 2006 and the non-parole period expires on 18 May 2026 the date upon which the offender is eligible for release to parole.

     Michael Beverley TRUDGETT v REGINA 
     
     
      
       
      The complainant attended a party hosted by the appellant in the backyard of his residence. A mutual friend introduced them. Although not his real name, the appellant was introduced as “Adam”. He and the complainant entered the house and after a period of time she emerged, distressed and crying. She reported to police that she had been sexually assaulted by “Adam”. Police arrested and charged the appellant with one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The complainant was never asked to identify the person by photographic array or by an identification parade or in court. At trial there was no dispute that the complainant had been sexually assaulted. The only matter in dispute was whether the appellant was the offender. A jury did so find. 
       
       
      The appellant appeals his conviction, arguing that a miscarriage of justice has occurred for the reason that the witnesses’ evidence is identification evidence and, accordingly, the trial judge was required to provide a jury direction under s 116 of the  
      Evidence Act  
      1995 warning them of the dangers of such evidence. The Crown submits that such evidence is not identification evidence and, accordingly, that no such direction was required. It further relies upon the proviso and r 4.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: On 25 August 2006 the appellant was found guilty after trial by jury of one charge of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. At the trial there was no dispute that the complainant had been sexually assaulted. The only matter in dispute was whether or not the appellant was the offender. 
     
      
    2 There is only one ground of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial miscarried by reason of the learned trial judge failing to direct the jury in relation to the dangers of identification evidence as required by s 116 of the  
        Evidence Act  
        1995.” 
        
       
      
    3 That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “116(1) If identification evidence has been admitted, the judge is to inform the jury: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) of the reasons for that need for caution, both generally and in the circumstances of the case. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not necessary that a particular form of words be used in so informing the jury.” 
        
       
      
    4 Section 116 is contained in Pt 3.9 of the Evidence Act entitled Identification Evidence. In that Part s 114 is concerned with the exclusion of visual identification evidence and s 115 is concerned with the exclusion of evidence of identification by pictures. 
     
      
    5 In the Dictionary to the Act the following definition appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        identification evidence  
        means evidence that is: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) an assertion by a person to the effect that a defendant was, or resembles (visually, aurally or otherwise) a person who was, present at or near a place where; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the offence for which the defendant is being prosecuted was committed; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) an act connected to that offence was done; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        at or about the time at which the offence was committed or the act was done, being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a report (whether oral or in writing) of such an assertion.” 
        
       
      
    6 The evidence at trial by the complainant was that she had been sexually assaulted by a person who had been introduced to her by the name of “Adam”. Her evidence was that the offender went into the house with her and assaulted her there. She ran out after the assault distressed and crying. She described the person but did not identify him. She was never asked to identify the person by the procedure of a photographic array or by an identification parade or in court.  
     
      
    7 Critical evidence in the case against the appellant came from witnesses who said that it was he who went into the house with the complainant and who emerged from the house at about the same time as her. The Crown contends that each of those witnesses knew the appellant by name. One of the witnesses said that he had introduced the appellant to the complainant by the name of “Adam”, although he knew it was not his name. 
     
      
    8 In his summing-up to the jury the trial judge summarised the relevant evidence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Very briefly, [GC] – he said in the course of his evidence that the accused was present at the house at the relevant time. [SN] said that it was he who introduced the accused to [Ms W] as being Adam. [DM] – he gave evidence that [Ms W] went inside the house, he thought for a drink and that he thought the accused was inside the house. He said that [Ms W] came outside upset and crying and that the accused came out a short time later saying something along the lines of ‘You may as well call it rape’. [SC] – he said that he saw [Ms W] walk inside the house with the accused and that later she ran out crying and that the accused came out of the house a bit later. That very briefly – and probably not doing the Crown case justice – is the nature of the evidence the Crown relies upon to prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who was the ‘Adam’ that sexually assaulted [Ms W].” (names replaced) 
        
       
       
      His Honour was not asked to, and did not, give the jury a warning in accordance with s 116. 
       
       
      Issues on the Appeal 
       
      
    9 The appellant submits that, as acknowledged during the course of the trial and in the trial judge’s instructions to the jury, the critical issue in the case was whether or not the person who sexually assaulted the complainant was the accused. 
     
      
    10 The appellant relies on the definition of “identification evidence” set out above. He submits that the relevant assertion was that the appellant was or resembles “a person”, namely the perpetrator, and was present when the offence was committed. Such assertions were made by witnesses who testified: 
     
      
    · that the appellant was at the party; 
     
      
    · that the appellant was introduced to the complainant; 
     
      
    · that the appellant was introduced as “Adam”; 
     
      
    · that the appellant entered and left the house where the assault occurred at the material time. 
     
      
    11 The appellant submits that the “truth” of each such assertion of identity was contested. He refers to Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; (2003) 217 CLR 1 at [19], [22], [53] and [94] and submits that, unlike that case, the issue of identification was in issue. 
     
      
    12 The appellant relies on the textual difference between s 116 and s 165, the latter providing that an appropriate warning should be given “if a party so requests”. He submits that the requirement for a direction under s 116 is mandatory, particularly in circumstances where “identification” was the central issue of a trial. The appellant relies on the judgment of this Court in R v Demiroz [2003] NSWCCA 146. 
     
      
    13 The appellant accepts that no request was made by counsel for the accused for any direction under s 116. The appellant accepts that he needs leave under r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. He submits that the centrality of the issue is such that leave should be granted, and that the failure to give the direction required by s 116 was a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    14 The Crown submits that the evidence does not fall within the definition of identification evidence in the Evidence Act. It submits that all of the witnesses, other than the complainant, knew the appellant personally by name and had attended his home on several occasions before the night of the assault on the complainant. None of them took part in identification procedures. All were giving direct evidence of their observations on the night in question.  
     
      
    15 Alternatively, the Crown seeks to distinguish the judgment in Demiroz on the basis that the appellant in that case had been identified at or near the place of the offence by witnesses who had no prior knowledge of him.  
     
      
    16 The Crown emphasises that witnesses gave evidence which, if accepted, proved that the appellant had been introduced to the complainant by the name of Adam, that he resided in the premises where the offence occurred, that he entered the house with the complainant, that they both emerged some time later when the complainant was distressed and that, at that time, the appellant said words that could amount to an admission. All of these witnesses knew the appellant personally and had visited his home. The issue at trial was their reliability, because of the fact that some witnesses had subsequently fallen out with the appellant and their recollection of the events was faulty because of alcohol and marijuana consumption at the party.  
     
      
    17 The evidence also gave rise to the usual range of inconsistencies eg height, eye colour, sequence of events. These were quintessential jury matters. 
     
      
    18 The Crown submits that leave pursuant to r 4 should be refused. Alternatively, the Crown invokes the proviso. 
     
      
       
      Recognition Evidence 
       
      
    19 The Crown submissions assert that evidence by a person who knows the accused well is not “identification evidence” within the statutory definition. Such evidence is often called “recognition evidence”. 
     
      
    20 As the decision in Dhanhoa indicates, the literal words of the definition can lead to absurd results. This is a frequent occurrence when a flexible common law principle is forced into a rigid verbal formulation.  
     
      
    21 The correct approach to the use of statutory definitions was identified by McHugh J in Kelly v The Queen [2004] HCA 12; (2004) 218 CLR 216 at [103]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[O]nce it is clear that the definition applies, the better – I think the only proper – course is to read the words of the definition into the substantive enactment and then construe the substantive enactment – in its extended or confined sense – in its context and bearing in mind its purpose and the mischief that it was designed to overcome. To construe the definition before its text has been inserted into the fabric of the substantive enactment invites error as to the meaning of the substantive enactment.” 
        
       
      
    22 This approach is consistent with how each judgment construed s 116 in Dhanhoa. I refer particularly to the reliance on the adversary system as a significant part of the context, qualifying a strict literal application of the words. (See Dhanhoa at [20], [22], [53].) 
     
      
    23 In order to determine whether the definition of identification evidence extends to recognition evidence, it is appropriate to focus on the words: 
     
      
       
        
        “… being an assertion that is based wholly or partly on what the person making the assertion saw, heard or otherwise perceived at that place and time.” 
        
       
      
    24 Recognition evidence is not “wholly” based on what the witness perceived at the time of the offence. However, it may be “partly” so based. 
     
      
    25 The distinction between “recognition” and “identification” was recognised in Davies and Cody v The King (1937) 57 CLR 170 where the High Court said in a joint judgment at 181: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is almost unnecessary to say that the amount of care and the nature of the precautions which should be taken when a potential witness is brought to identify an accused or suspected person must vary according to the familiarity of the witness with that person. It would be ridiculous … to deny the value or reliability of the identification if the witness’ knowledge of the prisoner arose from long and close association or from every day intercourse in business affairs.” 
        
       
      
    26 However, this analysis does not suggest that witnesses cannot err when purporting to recognise a person that they have known intimately and/or for a long time. I note particularly the observations of Lord Widgery CJ in R v Turnbull [1977] QB 224 at 228: 
     
      
       
        
        “Recognition may be more reliable than identification of a stranger; but even when the witness is purporting to recognise someone whom he knows, the jury should be reminded that mistakes in recognition of close relatives and friends are sometimes made.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (See also 
       Smith v The Queen  
      [2001] HCA 50; (2001) 206 CLR 650 at [55].)  
       
      
    27 I note that the joint judgment in Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 referred to Turnbull with approval. (See at 561, fn 18.) Furthermore, consistently with the whole of the analysis in Turnbull at 228 (not just the part I have extracted), the High Court considered a list of relevant circumstances at 565 which commenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The adequacy of the warning has to be evaluated by reference to  
        the nature of the relationship between the witness and the person identified  
        …” 
        
       
       
      This indicates that a warning may be appropriate in a recognition case.  
       
      
    28 The development of the common law with respect to recognition evidence is set out by Redlich AJA, with whom Maxwell P and Buchanan JA agreed, in R v Spero [2006] VSCA 58; (2006) 13 VR 225 at [25]–[30]. His Honour concluded that, on the facts of that case (the complainant had known the applicant for 25 years) no warning was required in accordance with Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555. Nevertheless, the requirements of s 116 and s 165 differ from, and in certain respects are stricter than, the directions required by Domican. (See R v Clarke (1997) 97 A Crim R 414 at 424–427.) 
     
      
    29 Plainly, recognition evidence does not suffer from all of the defects of identification evidence. However, it does share with such evidence the danger that a witness will propound his or her conclusion with force and conviction. Furthermore, both forms are also likely to be given special weight by a jury, even where its reliability is dubious. 
     
      
    30 Generally speaking, recognition evidence will be more reliable than identification evidence strictly so called. For example, the displacement effect and the rogues gallery effect would not appear to be material. That is not, however, sufficient to exclude it from the Dictionary definition and from s 116 as a category. Section 116 does not turn on any issue of reliability (cf s 165).  
     
      
    31 In my opinion, the Crown submission, that recognition evidence does not fall within the definition of “identification evidence” at all, should be rejected. (See also Gardiner v R [2006] NSWCCA 190; (2006) 162 A Crim R 233 at [68]–[69].) 
     
      
    32 Nevertheless, in accordance with the approach to reading in statutory definitions identified in Kelly v The Queen, quoted at [21] above, it is necessary to have in mind the immediate textual context. Evidence that has been admitted about the ‘presence’ of a person is to be subject to a jury direction both generally as to the “special need for caution” and, specifically, in the particular circumstances of a case. It will often be difficult to give content to the specific requirement where the witness knows the person, particularly where s/he knows the person well. 
     
      
    33 Notwithstanding the mandatory language of s 116, this consideration is likely to be of significance where, as here, r 4 applies or the proviso is invoked. Had I been of the opinion that s 116 was engaged, I would have applied r 4. However, for the following reasons, it is unnecessary to do so. 
     
      
       
       
      The Alleged Identification Evidence 
       
      
    34 The appellant characterised the evidence of the complainant as identification evidence. The complainant’s evidence included a physical description but, relevantly, was to the effect that the person who attacked her was introduced to her as “Adam” and that that was all she knew about him. 
     
      
    35 The complainant made no “assertion … to the effect that the” appellant “was, or resembles … a person”, namely the perpetrator. She gave no “identification evidence” within the meaning of the Dictionary definition. 
     
      
    36 In this regard, the appellant’s submissions involve a confused use of the word “identification”. Of course the evidence of the introduction, when combined with the evidence next to be considered, assisted the jury to “identify” the appellant as the assailant. However, that process is not “identification evidence” by a witness that has been “admitted” for purposes of s 116. 
     
      
    37 One witness said that he introduced the appellant to the complainant and did so under the name of “Adam”. This is evidence of what the witness said. It is not evidence of what the witness “saw, heard or otherwise perceived” and, accordingly, is also not “identification evidence” within the Dictionary definition. The same confusion appears as that referred to above. 
     
      
    38 Obviously, it is implicit in evidence to the effect, ‘I introduced X to Y’ that X and Y were there at the time. That is not, in my opinion, evidence of ‘presence’ within s 116. The long history of identification evidence indicates that the Dictionary definition is concerned with direct evidence of ‘presence’, not indirect evidence of the character involved in reciting the occurrence of an introduction.  
     
      
    39 A number of other witnesses gave express evidence that the appellant was present on the evening. The premises at which the events occurred were occupied by the appellant as his residence. Counsel who appeared for the appellant on this appeal accepted that he was present at the premises during the party.  
     
      
    40 At trial, save perhaps in one ambiguous question, none of the witnesses who testified about his presence were cross-examined with a suggestion to the contrary. However, there was an issue as to whether he had entered and left the house itself around the time of the offence. 
     
      
    41 One witness gave evidence that he thought the appellant was inside the house. This witness said he saw the complainant come out of the house in a distressed state and, shortly thereafter, saw the appellant who said: “You may as well say I raped you a couple of times?”. 
     
      
    42 A second witness said he saw the appellant go inside with the complainant and that 20 minutes later he saw the girl run out in a distressed state. He said he saw the appellant come out “a bit later”. 
     
      
    43 There was no issue at the trial about whether the appellant was present at the party held at his own residence. Dhanhoa is authority for the proposition that s 116 is not engaged, notwithstanding its literal terms, if there is no dispute about the identification evidence. (See at [19]–[22], [51], [53], [92]–[94].)  
     
      
    44 Furthermore, s 116 was not engaged in Dhanhoa, where the fact in issue was not the person’s presence on the night in question, but whether he was still present when the offence occurred. The defence case at trial was that the Appellant had been there on that night, but had left before the offence occurred. 
     
      
    45 As Gleeson CJ and Hayne J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[9] … The critical question was whether the appellant was still in the flat when the attack occurred.” 
        
       
      
    46 Their Honours also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[16] The identification evidence here in question was the assertion, in the evidence of the victim, … that the person shown in photograph No 8 (the appellant) was, or resembled, a person who was present at or about the time of the events … It was the assertion that the appellant was, or resembled, a man who was present at or about the time when the victim was attacked and then taken from his flat that constituted the identification evidence; not the detail of his alleged conduct. By the time the case was left to the jury, the area of dispute about that matter had been confined. The appellant did not dispute that he was present at the flat … his case was that he had departed shortly before the alleged events occurred. Having regard to the time intervals … on any view the appellant was present  
        at or about 
         the time when the offences were committed.” 
        
       
      
    47 Gleeson CJ and Hayne J concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[23] … [I]n the light of the appellant's evidence, the only question was whether the man in photograph No 8 was still there when the attack occurred, or whether he had left shortly before. It was not the reliability of the identification that was in dispute; it was the reliability of the account of the conduct of the person identified, and, in particular, of the evidence that such person remained with his three companions at all material times.” 
        
       
      
    48 The other judgments similarly concluded that the issue of whether the person, who had been present, remained there at the relevant time did not require a direction. 
     
      
    49 This conclusion in Dhanhoa is not consistent with an approach which applies the words of the Dictionary definition to evidence about an accused’s movements during the relevant period. By emphasising the words “at or about” the time of the offence, the reasoning in Dhanhoa led to the conclusion that once presence is accepted, the detail of presence at a specific time or location, is not relevantly in issue for the purposes of s 116. 
     
      
    50 In the present case, the evidence about the appellant’s entry into, and departure from, the house during the course of the party did not require a direction. First, like the evidence of the introduction discussed above, this is indirect evidence of ‘presence’ and s 116 is concerned with direct evidence. Secondly, his presence “at or about” the time of the offence was not in issue. 
     
      
    51 The circumstances under consideration are, in my opinion, analogous to those in Dhanhoa. Whether or not the appellant entered and left the house is, in my opinion, the same kind of issue as whether the appellant in Dhanhoa had left the unit before the assault. No direction was required with respect to this evidence. 
     
      
    52 The appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Simpson J. I wish expressly to affirm my agreement with what her Honour has written about the purported “principle” of parsimony. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I have had the benefit of reading the Reasons for Judgment of Simpson J and can accordingly be brief. I agree with the orders proposed by her Honour and generally with her Honour’s Reasons. 
     
      
    3 This Court is entitled to interfere with the sentence imposed by Hughes DCJ only if error can be found in that sentence. Given the limited options open to his Honour in consequence of the Applicant not being judged suitable for periodic detention or community service because of his residence in Queensland, I am unable to conclude that there is any such error.  
     
      
    4 The matter I find of most concern is that it was 5 years after his offending that the Applicant was sentenced to imprisonment, he having been at liberty meanwhile. Such a situation has hallmarks of injustice about it. However, although it would seem that it was only when in 2006 some of the charges against the Applicant’s brother came to trial and were dismissed that the Crown reduced the number of charges against the Applicant and he felt disposed to plead guilty to the remainder, the fact remains that the option to plead guilty to the offences which he now admits was available to him long ago. 
     
      
    5 In these circumstances I am not persuaded that the 5 year delay to which I have referred is not, at least in significant measure, something for which the Applicant is responsible. Thus I am not disposed to conclude that the result is so unjust that the (relatively short) sentence imposed by Hughes DCJ should not be allowed to stand. 
     
      
    6 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 13 July 2007 by Hughes DCJ following his pleas of guilty to charges brought by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (“the DPP”) under the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  
     
      
    7 The applicant pleaded guilty to three counts of fraudulent misappropriation, contrary to s 178A of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty prescribed by the Crimes Act in respect of the offence is imprisonment for 7 years. 
     
      
    8 Hughes DCJ sentenced the applicant, on the second count on the indictment, to imprisonment for 18 months to commence on 13 July 2007, with a non-parole period of 9 months that would expire on 12 April 2008; on the first and third charges he imposed fixed terms of imprisonment for 6 months to commence the same day and be served concurrently with one another and with the first imposed sentence. Having regard to the length of the sentence imposed on the major count, the applicant was entitled also to an order that he be released on parole at the expiration of the non-parole period: s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”).  
     
      
    9 His Honour stated that, were it not for the pleas of guilty, the overall sentence would have been of imprisonment for 2 years, which he discounted by 25 percent in recognition of the pleas of guilty. He found special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, as a consequence of which he varied the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period there stated. 
     
      
    10 Although the applicant was taken into custody on the day of sentencing and began serving his sentence, he was, on 23 August 2007, granted bail pending the hearing and determination of this application. 
     
      
    11 One of the conditions of his bail was specified as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Appear in Court of Criminal Appeal as directed.” 
        
       
      
    12 Notwithstanding that express condition, the applicant was advised by his solicitor that it was not necessary for him to attend on the date the application was listed for hearing, and he did not do so. Since he appears to have acted on incorrect legal advice, this Court opted against issuing a warrant for his arrest, and directed instead that he attend on the date he is advised the application is listed for judgment. 
     
      
    13 Another condition of his bail was that the applicant reside at an address (his parents’ address) at Kensington, NSW, and another that he report twice weekly to the Officer in Charge of the Maroubra Police Station. However, on 11 September 2007 these conditions were varied to enable the applicant to resume living at his former residence in Queensland and to report once weekly to the Officer in Charge of the Noosa Heads Police Station. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    14 All offences on the indictment were committed over a period of a few months in 2002. In each case the applicant, who, with his brother Richard Blundell, operated an insurance brokerage business, represented to a client that a particular kind of insurance would be (or had been) arranged and obtained from that client funds for payment of the premium but failed to make the necessary arrangements or remit the funds to the insurance company, rather, diverting the funds into a business or personal account. One consequence was that clients who believed that they had insurance cover against various contingencies were in fact uninsured. In the case of the offences committed by the applicant the victims were a recreational club (presumably licensed) and a company that owned and operated two hotels. 
     
      
    15 The applicant’s brother, Richard Blundell, was charged with four similar offences, and asked that a further five offences be taken into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. These were all offences of a similar nature to those committed by the applicant, but involved different clients/victims. 
     
      
    16 The total amount involved in the charges against Richard Blundell was $16,920.39, of which $8827.30 was attributable to the offences the subject of the indictment, and the balance of $8093.09, to the Form 1 offences. At first instance, Richard Blundell was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, made up of a non-parole period of 6 months and a balance of term of 12 months. This Court on 14 December 2007 granted leave to appeal against the sentence, quashed the sentences and directed him to perform 100 hours of community service work.  
     
      
    17 The amount involved in the applicant’s offences was vastly higher than that involved in the offences to which his brother pleaded guilty, amounting in total to $146,000. This may have been because of the identity of the victims, who were the operators of licensed premises, where, it may be assumed, insurance premiums are significant.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    18 The applicant was born in 1964. He was 38 years of age when the offending began, 43 at sentencing. By the time of sentencing he had moved to live in Noosaville, Queensland. He is married and has three daughters aged 14, nine and seven. The house is rented. In a pre-sentence report it was asserted that he had suffered a nervous breakdown in 2004 and had used anti-depressant medication for a period of about 18 months before weaning himself off the drug because of unfavourable side effects.  
     
      
    19 His criminal history is limited to a 1983 offence of driving with the prescribed concentration of alcohol, and three traffic offences (speeding), and an offence, committed in February 2007 and therefore post dating the present offence, of driving under the influence of liquor.  
     
      
    20 He owns a house in Maroubra which is rented, producing an income of $6000 per month. It is subject to a mortgage of $1.2 million for which the repayments virtually swallow the entirety of the rental. 
     
      
    21 The insurance brokerage business had been established by the applicant’s grandfather and had remained in the family for three generations.  
     
      
    22 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. He said that he had suffered depression and anxiety, which he had been unable to overcome, and that he and his wife had decided to move from the eastern suburbs to Queensland because of his embarrassment at the charges he was facing. He had no intention of returning to live in NSW, but felt the loss of contact with his family. 
     
      
    23 At the time of sentencing he was conducting a business of manufacturing, hiring and selling camper trailers.  
     
      
    24 He produced a large number of character references, and called some witnesses to give oral evidence as to his good character. This suggested that he had made considerable contributions to the community, particularly in teaching young people, including disabled children, to sail. 
     
      
    25 One matter concerning the case he presented cannot be overlooked. He presented three psychiatric reports from Dr Rosalie Wilcox, dated 7 March 2004, 23 May 2004 and 21 June 2004. Dr Wilcox was in fact a treating psychiatrist to whom the applicant had been referred by his general practitioner. What is notable about these reports is that they are addressed to a claims assessor of an insurance company and it is plain from their content that they were written for the purpose of assisting the applicant to obtain payment under a disability benefits policy that he held. The reports are particularly notable for their omission of any reference to the charges that he was then facing. In the first report, under the heading “History obtained” Dr Wilcox wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Blundell told me that the three months prior to leaving work were a blur. Around Christmas 2002 he ‘went off the rails’ as he became withdrawn, did not want to get out of bed, was in tears, had no energy, could not sleep and had panic attacks.  
        He denied that there were any external factors of relevance  
        however I note that Dr Snowden queried whether something had occurred in the workplace …” (italics added) 
        
       
       
      In oral evidence the applicant maintained that he had given an accurate history to Dr Wilcox. 
       
      
    26 Counsel who appeared for the applicant in the sentencing proceedings accepted that an obvious inference from this is that the applicant was “devious” in his dealings with the insurance company, in failing to disclose (or, indeed, concealing) his criminal activity. However, although the applicant was cross-examined, this issue was not taken up, and it does not really advance the present application. 
     
      
    27 In a letter written to the applicant’s legal representatives on 8 May 2007, the DPP advised that, if the applicant were to plead guilty to the three counts on the indictment, it would submit to the court that a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention would be within the range of available sentencing options; that anything less than a “substantial” term would amount to appellable error; and that, if the applicant were to be convicted after trial, it would submit that a term of fulltime imprisonment would be the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    28 The Crown did not depart from this position. 
     
      
    29 A pre-sentence report assessed the applicant as unsuitable for a community service order, or an order that any prison sentence be served by way of periodic detention, because of his interstate residence. There do not appear to be any arrangements between this State and Queensland that would allow such a sentence to be supervised there. 
     
      
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    30 In sentencing the applicant, Hughes DCJ twice observed that there had been no victim; this, presumably, because, during the period which the clients concerned were uninsured, no event occurred as a result of which any of them called upon the insurance policy that it believed it had. He accepted that there was little chance of the applicant re-offending and that his rehabilitation was “all but complete”.  
     
      
    31 Because of his unsuitability for a community service order or an order that sentence be served by way of periodic detention, it was put to his Honour that any custodial sentence to be imposed ought to be suspended. He rejected that. 
     
      
    32 His Honour was also alive to the applicant’s lack of frankness with Dr Wilcox, in his omission to attribute the symptoms upon which she reported to his criminal conduct and the charges he was facing. He also referred to “a significant degree of deviousness” by him in responses he gave to clients who sought confirmation of their insurance status.  
     
      
    33 His Honour then proceeded to impose the sentences outlined above. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    34 No grounds of appeal appear to have been filed. Appended to an amended application for leave to appeal was a document entitled “Amended Submissions”.  
     
      
    35 These were, in toto, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The applicant was born … [in] 1964 and had no prior convictions. 
         
         
        2. The applicant is now residing with his parents … and is applying for reassessment by the Probation and Parole Service as to his eligibility for community service and periodic detention, such further report will be available at the hearing of this application. 
         
         
        3. A solid body of evidence was presented to his Honour both in oral evidence and documentary form which was favourable to the applicant. 
         
         
        4. The prosecution did not oppose the imposition of periodic detention. 
         
         
        5. His Honour failed to give sufficient weight to the strong family and community ties of the applicant.” 
        
       
      
    36 The difficulty for the applicant is that, to the extent that these submissions are intended to challenge the adequacy of consideration given to subjective circumstances, they run straight up against the express words in the Remarks on Sentence. His Honour was fully aware of all of the subjective circumstances. In the case of the applicant, the options of a Community Service Order or imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention were not available by reason of Mr Blundell’s interstate residence. 
     
      
    37 No evidence was adduced to support the assertion that appears as paragraph 2 of the “Amended Submissions”, and no oral submissions were advanced in its support. In any event, the evidence before the sentencing judge was to the contrary, as set out above. His Honour cannot be held to have erred in imposing sentence on the basis of the facts as they then existed.  
     
      
    38 Counsel who appeared for the applicant placed heavy weight on what she called the “principle of parsimony”. The argument derived from a judgment of Adams J (who did not claim to be the originator of the “principle”) in DB v R; DNN v R [2007] NSWCCA 27. At [10] his Honour said:  
     
      
       
        
        “… It is a fundamental assumption of sentencing jurisprudence that in no case will only one sentence be correct … In every other case the circumstances will justify a range of sentences, often quite a wide range, that may properly be passed. Although not articulated, so far as I am aware, in the decisions of this Court, it seems to me that it is also fundamental that the minimum sentence that reflects the objective and subjective features of a case and satisfies the purposes of sentencing … should be that which is imposed. This has been called the principle of parsimony, a phrase that originated in the judgment of Napier CJ in  
        Webb v O'Sullivan  
        (1952) SASR 65 at 66 and has become common in Victoria see, eg,  
        R v Storey  
        (1996) [1998] 1 VR 359 at 366;  
        R v PP  
        (2003) 142 A Crim R 369 at 374. To impose a more severe sentence is,  
        ex hypothesi 
        , to intrude other inappropriate purposes into the administration of criminal justice. It is trite that minds may well reasonably differ as to what this minimum sentence might be in the circumstances of any particular case. Whether one applies this approach or not, it is unarguable that more than one sentence will invariably be warranted in law. This assumption is fundamental to the application of s 6(3) of the [ 
        Criminal Appeal 
        ]  
        Act  
        [1912].” 
        
       
       
      (I can detect, in  
      Webb v O’Sullivan 
      , no reference to “the principle of parsimony”.) 
       
      
    39 The other members of the bench in DB; DNN were McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J, neither of whom endorsed the observations. Neither do I. Indeed, it seems to me that there is a fundamental contradiction in the paragraph: his Honour plainly accepts, as indeed he must, the well recognised and thoroughly entrenched principle that, in any case, a range of sentences exists. Where a sentencing judge imposes a sentence within that range, it will not be held to be erroneous, notwithstanding that another judge might have selected a different sentence. That cannot stand with the proposition, said to be “fundamental”, that the minimum sentence that reflects the objective and subjective features of a case and satisfies the purposes of sentencing should be that which is imposed. The two simply cannot stand together. 
     
      
    40 Nor is the proposition supported by the authorities cited. In Webb Napier CJ was dealing with an appeal against a sentence imposed by a magistrate in respect of an offence of driving whilst so much under the influence of intoxicating liquor as to be incapable of exercising effective control. It appears that the relevant legislation provided for an increased sentence in respect of a second offence. At first instance, the magistrate had in fact imposed a sentence in excess of that which could lawfully be awarded in respect of a first offence. In fact, as the record showed, the offence in question was a second offence. Nevertheless, Napier CJ then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In cases of this kind 
        , where the discretion of the court is so much at large, I think that it is a mistake to have any rule of thumb. The court should endeavour to make the punishment fit the crime, and the circumstances of the offender, as nearly as may be. Our first concern is the protection of the public, but, subject to that, the court should lean towards mercy.  
        We ought not to award the maximum which the offence will warrant, but rather the minimum which is consistent with a due regard for the public interest 
        .” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    41 However, that was in a context in which his Honour had held: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is a second offence, but … it is apparent that it was an infraction which approximated in gravity to the minimum rather than to the maximum contemplated by the statute, that is to say, for a second offence … 
         
         
        … regard should be had to the lower as well as to the upper limit of the penalties prescribed. Treating this as the second offence, the gravity approximates to the lower end of the scale, and there is no reason why the penalty should not be assessed upon that basis …” 
        
       
      
    42 In my opinion Napier CJ was not purporting to lay down any rule or principle of sentencing. His remarks were confined to the circumstances of the case that was before him. 
     
      
    43 It is true that in both R v Storey [1998] 1 VR 359 and R v PP [2003] VSCA 100; 142 A Crim R 369, the Court mentioned – in passing – “the principle of parsimony”. In Storey the Victorian Court of Appeal was dealing with an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed following pleas of guilty to charges of trafficking in a drug of dependence, of being in possession of a drug of dependence and of unlawful possession of a pistol. At p 366 the Court considered the approach to sentencing that distinguishes between aggravating and mitigating circumstances and rejected a rigid distinction between “circumstances of the offender” and circumstances of the offence. In that context their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing is not a mechanical process. It requires the exercise of a discretion. There is no single ‘right’ answer which can be determined by the application of principle. Different minds will attribute different weight to various facts in arriving at the ‘instinctive synthesis’ which takes account of the various purposes for which sentences are imposed – just punishment, deterrence, rehabilitation, denunciation, protection of the community –  
        and which pays due regard to principles of totality, parity, parsimony and the like … 
        ” (italics added; internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    44 Their Honours did not explain what they meant or understood by “the principle of parsimony” and cited no authority for its application to the sentencing law of Victoria. 
     
      
    45 In PP Callaway JA, with whom Winneke P agreed, was dealing with a 15 year old who had been convicted of manslaughter. The observations made were to do with principles applicable to the sentencing of children. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is required in every case is a sound discretionary judgment that gives appropriate weight, and usually great weight, to youthful immaturity, the better prospects that a young person has for rehabilitation and the desirability of keeping such offenders out of the adult prison system. Those considerations reinforce and complement the common law principle of parsimony and statutory provisions such as s 5(3) and (4) of the  
        Sentencing Act  
        [ 
        1991 
        ].” 
        
       
      
    46 As in Storey, the allusion was made in passing, and is not supported by references to any authority that establishes “the principle of parsimony” to be a sentencing principle applicable in Victoria. Nor was any explanation or interpretation of the term given. 
     
      
    47 I do not read these judgments as containing or endorsing a proposition that mandates that the minimum sentence that reflects the objective and subjective features of a case and satisfies the purposes of sentencing must be that which is imposed. That is inconsistent with the notion of a range of sentences, and the discretions properly open to sentencing judges. I do not accept that “the principle of parsimony”, at least as, on one construction of DB; DNN, it appears to have been interpreted by Adams J, is part of the sentencing law of NSW. In Kelly v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 357 at [30] Basten JA rejected that construction of the judgment in DB; DNN. Adams J, who, coincidentally, was also a member of that Bench, agreed with Basten JA. 
     
      
    48 For completeness, I extract para [30] of Kelly: 
     
      
       
        
        “To suggest that there will not be, almost inevitably, a range of sentences which could appropriately be characterised as ‘warranted in law’ is to misunderstand his Honour’s judgment; Adams J expressly stated the contrary in the balance of [10] through to [12]. If the ‘principle of parsimony’ is taken to imply that there cannot be such a range, that language should be abandoned. Indeed, ‘parsimony’ is a slightly curious word to use in this context, albeit it has, as his Honour noted, a respectable lineage in Victoria. In the South Australian case to which Adams J referred,  
        Webb v O’Sullivan  
        [1952] SASR 65 at 66, Napier CJ, in dealing with a traffic offence, had merely stated:  
         
         
          
          ‘Our first concern is the protection of the public, but, subject to that, the court should lean towards mercy. We ought not to award the maximum which the offence will warrant, but rather the minimum which is consistent with a due regard for the public interest.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    49 There are, nevertheless, some troubling features in this application. The offences were committed in the first half of 2002. The applicant was not sentenced until July 2007. No explanation emerged for the very long delay. It is apparent, from some discussion between the sentencing judge and counsel, that additional charges had been laid against both brothers. In 2006 a different District Court judge dismissed those charges against Richard Blundell, as a consequence of which the DPP elected not to proceed against the applicant in respect of the same or similar charges. It may be that the pending trial on those charges provides some explanation for the five years which elapsed between the offences and ultimate sentencing. The materials before this Court do not make clear the dates on which the offences were discovered, or charges first laid.  
     
      
    50 In any event, the fact remains that the applicant came for sentence five years after his offending. The evidence disclosed significant steps towards rehabilitation. But that was all before the sentencing judge, and was taken into account by him. 
     
      
    51 The most troubling aspect, however, is the question of relativity with the sentences ultimately imposed upon the applicant’s brother, Richard Blundell. I have used the term “relativity”, and deliberately avoided the term “parity” because, it seems to me, the facts of the case do not fit easily within the authorities that are concerned with parity: Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295. 
     
      
    52 Although the two brothers were charged with offences of the same kind, committed at about the same time, and the gravamen of their offences was similar if not identical, the actual frauds they perpetrated were on different clients, and in vastly different sums. There is much suspicion that the two were acting in concert, but that was not the way the Crown elected to conduct the prosecution, and this Court cannot be satisfied, and cannot act on the basis that each brother was liable for the defalcations actually committed by the other. It is possible, if unlikely, that each of the two hit upon a scheme of salvaging the financial position of the firm in the same way, without disclosing that to the other. 
     
      
    53 The result is that Richard Blundell stood to be sentenced for the nine offences that he admitted, involving just under $17,000, while the applicant stood to be sentenced for three offences involving $146,000. Fraud on such a magnitude cannot, in my opinion, be met with anything less than a full time custodial sentence. There was no error by the sentencing judge in so concluding. 
     
      
    54 Nor was there any error in his assessment of the length of the overall sentence. 
     
      
    55 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

     ALRAMADAN v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) (NO. 2) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 23 November 2007 the Court dismissed an appeal against conviction brought by the present applicant: Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 322. The judgment and orders were entered in the Registry on the same day. On 6 December 2007, that is within 14 days of the judgment being entered, the applicant wrote to the Registrar asking that the matter be relisted. This letter was treated as an application to set aside or vary the order and thus invoked the power of the Court under r 50C(2) of the Criminal Appeal Rules (NSW). It is convenient to set that rule out in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Power to set aside or vary order 
         
        50C 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The Court may set aside or vary an order if an application for the setting aside or variation is made before entry of the order. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If an application for the setting aside or variation of an order is made within 14 days after the order is entered, the Court may determine the matter, and (if appropriate) set aside or vary the order under subrule (1), as if the order had not been entered. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Within 14 days after an order is entered, the Court may of its own motion set aside or vary the order as if the order had not been entered. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The Court may not extend the time limited by subrule (2) or (3). 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Nothing in this rule affects any other power of the Court to aside or vary an order.” 
        
       
      
    2 This rule commenced on 7 September 2007 and, so far as the Court is aware, its operation has not previously been considered. Neither party suggested that r 50C(2) should not be applied in accordance with its terms. 
     
      
    3 As the Director noted, similar provisions were introduced into the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules (NSW) contemporaneously: see r 36.16(3A)–(3C). The Court was invited to note both the underlying reason for the rule (based upon entry of judgments in the electronic record of the Court) and the explanatory note which stated that the new rules would enable orders under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) “to be entered, and to enable them to be set aside and varied, in ways similar to those for judgments and orders under the Civil Procedure Act 2005”: see Criminal Appeal Rules (Amendment No. 1) 2007; GG No 116, 7/09/07, p 6888. This invitation need not be accepted for present purposes. The note is expressed in broad terms which need to be considered in the light of the remarks of Dixon J in Grierson v The Queen (1938) 60 CLR 431 at 436, in a passage cited with approval in Elliott v The Queen; Blessington v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; 82 ALJR 82 at [7]. In addressing the effect of the Criminal Appeal Act, Dixon J stated at p 436: 
     
      
       
        
        “The determination of an appeal is evidently definitive, and a conviction unappealed is equally final. No considerations controlling or affecting the conclusion to be deduced from these provisions are supplied by analogous civil proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    4 It is sufficient for present purposes to apply r 50C(2) in its terms, so that the Court will have the same powers under the Criminal Appeal Act, taking into account relevant principles under the general law, as it has always had in relation to orders which have not been entered. 
     
      
    5 The entry or perfection of orders is well-established as a final limitation on the powers of this Court to re-open an appeal. As explained by Dawson and Gaudron J in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 300: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a final order was made perfecting the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on Postiglione’s first application, the assumption of jurisdiction to entertain his second application and the ensuing appeal was contrary to the decision of this Court in  
        Grierson v The King  
        (1938) 60 CLR 431. It was held in that case that the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 (NSW) does not confer jurisdiction to re-open an appeal which has been heard on the merits and finally determined. A fortiori, in a case where what is involved is the hearing of a second appeal.  
        Pantorno  
        does not suggest otherwise. The view was expressed in  
        Pantorno 
         that an intermediate court of appeal can entertain an application to remedy a denial of procedural fairness whether or not its order has been perfected ( 
        Pantorno v The Queen  
        (1989) 166 CLR 466 at 474, per Mason CJ and Brennan J; at 484, per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ).” 
        
       
       
      The same approach was accepted by McHugh J (at p 315) and by Gummow J (at p 327). 
       
      
    6 Where judgment has been given but the order has not been entered, the power to reconsider an appeal is not precluded. Nevertheless, the circumstances in which the Court will be persuaded to entertain further argument (and possibly further evidence) are quite limited. In Elliott and Blessington at [31]-[32], the High Court held that the criteria by which this Court should determine an application to re-open a proceeding, prior to judgment being entered, were those stated by Mason CJ in Autodesk Inc v Dyason (No. 2) [1993] HCA 6; 176 CLR 300 at 303: 
     
      
       
        
        “What must emerge, in order to enliven the exercise of the jurisdiction, is that the Court has apparently proceeded according to some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law and that this misapprehension cannot be attributed solely to the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing. The purpose of the jurisdiction is not to provide a backdoor method by which unsuccessful litigants can seek to reargue their cases.” 
        
       
      
    7 Applying those principles in the present case, it is necessary to identify some misapprehension of fact or law, not solely attributable to the applicant, which materially affected this Court’s judgment in the appeal. 
     
      
    8 The basis of the present application was the availability of two further statements by witnesses for the accused, whose evidence was rejected at trial. The difficulty which the applicant faces is that the sole reason this material was not considered by the Court at the hearing of the appeal was that he did not put it before the Court. The difficulty he faces in satisfying the test adopted in Elliott and Blessington is immediately apparent. However, it is desirable to explain in a little more detail the relevance of the material on the case presented for the applicant. 
     
      
    9 The principal issue on the appeal was whether the trial judge had erred in rejecting evidence proposed to be called from Dr Alan Nicholls and Dr Bernadette White. Doctor Nicholls was an orthopaedic surgeon from whom it was proposed to adduce evidence with respect to the condition of the applicant’s left leg and knee, resulting from an injury caused in a motor accident. The thrust of the evidence was that the applicant would have had great difficulty in climbing onto the examination table in his surgery and having sexual intercourse with the complainant, in the manner in which she described the events. This Court held on the appeal that his Honour was in error in rejecting such evidence but concluded that the error did not constitute a substantial miscarriage of justice because, had it been adduced, the evidence put before the trial judge by way of a written report would not have affected the outcome of the case. 
     
      
    10 The second witness whose evidence was rejected was Dr Bernadette White, an obstetrician and gynaecologist. The thrust of Dr White’s proposed evidence was that although semen from the applicant were found on a “high vaginal swab” obtained from the complainant, that could occur otherwise than through “normal intercourse”. Again, the Court held that the evidence was relevant and admissible but concluded that the material contained in a letter from Dr White would not have affected the outcome of the trial. 
     
      
    11 Although the Court was unanimous in identifying error and in applying the proviso with respect to the material from Dr Nicholls and Dr White which was before the trial judge (and this Court), Rothman J dissented on the ground that the oral evidence from those witnesses would not necessarily have been confined to or have been identical with their written reports: at [79]. In effect, the applicant now seeks to avail himself of the opportunity which would have been accorded to him by Rothman J but not by the majority to present more detailed and relevant evidence from the two experts. 
     
      
    12 Accepting that it was necessary to reopen the appeal to call further evidence, the applicant assayed that task, but without providing any explanation as to why such further, and arguably more persuasive, material had not been presented on the appeal. Senior counsel for the applicant properly accepted that his application must be confined to material relevant to the existing grounds of appeal. In substance, the applicant has sought to reopen the appeal so as to remedy a deficiency in the material presented at the hearing. That approach would appear to fall squarely within the impermissible purpose of seeking “by a backdoor method” to reargue an unsuccessful appeal. It cannot be justified on the criteria explained by Mason CJ in Autodesk (No. 2). 
     
      
    13 In the end, the present application was based upon the proposition that although this Court unanimously held that the evidence disclosed in the original reports of the experts sought to be called at trial was insufficiently persuasive or relevant to affect the outcome, the applicant was entitled to present more persuasive evidence than that presented at trial and on the appeal, and persuade this Court to reopen the appeal in order to consider that evidence. 
     
      
    14 As indicated above, this is a clear case of a reopening being proposed in order to enable the applicant to reargue the appeal. If the Court acted under some misapprehension as to the relevant facts at the hearing of the appeal, that was solely due to the manner in which the appellant ran his case. There was no suggestion, it should be added, that experienced counsel who ran the appeal did so otherwise than competently. Nor was it suggested that the Court in some way obstructed the presentation of the appeal. 
     
      
    15 It was for these reasons that on the hearing of the application on 25 March 2008, the Court ordered that the application be dismissed.

     R v Christopher John LENATI 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Simpson J in draft form. I agree with the order that her Honour proposes and, subject to the following remarks, I agree generally with her Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge commented that the respondent had provided the evidence that supported the prosecution and that in the absence of his willingness to speak frankly about his part in the offences it is doubtful that he would have been charged with them. His Honour concluded that, “the degree of assistance he has provided has been of a most unusual and perhaps outstanding type”. There was evidence that the respondent had exposed himself to danger by reason of his assistance and for this reason and he was expected to serve his sentence in the Special Purposes prison. The combined discount for his pleas of guilty and his assistance to the authorities at the date of sentence was 40 percent. I agree that this is indicative of some moderation of the discount to which the respondent was entitled (for what he had done) in order to accommodate a further discount (for what he promised to do) without producing an overall sentence that was unreasonably disproportionate to the offences.  
     
      
    3 I prefer not to approach the analysis upon the basis that the respondent was entitled to a discrete discount based on the principles in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 in addition to the combined discount for his pleas of guilty and assistance to the authorities under s 23(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). In Ellis Street CJ observed that the disclosure of otherwise unknown guilt merits a significant added element of leniency, the degree of which will vary according to the degree of likelihood of that guilt being discovered by the authorities (at 604). Ellis was decided before R v Thomson; R v Houlten [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. Almost invariably in a case in which an offender has assisted the authorities, including by admitting his or her guilt, there will be a discount for the plea of guilty which is at the top of the range promulgated by the guideline judgment. This circumstance necessarily affects the extent of the discount for assistance, including in cases in which there has been a voluntary disclosure of guilt: SZ v R [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249 per Howie J at 252, [9] to [11].  
     
      
    4 The respondent was first spoken to by police in December 2003 in connection with the investigation of the murder of Sayed Frangieh, which occurred on 7 December 2003. It is not suggested that the respondent was criminally involved in the murder, however, it is relevant to note that he was involved in a drive-by shooting outside the Frangieh home which occurred two months earlier and which was also the subject of investigation by the strike force which was set up to investigate the murder (Strike Force Jean). It appears that the respondent did not give a frank account to the police in December 2003 of his knowledge of matters that were the subject of their investigation. Shortly after this interview he left the jurisdiction and returned to New Zealand. The police attached to Strike Force Jean considered that the drive-by shooting and the murder were linked to a dispute involving Ken Tan. The respondent was identified as an associate of Ken Tan. The police travelled to New Zealand in order to interview the respondent about his movements on the day of the murder. In the course of giving the police a statement the respondent outlined his association with Ken Tan. He subsequently made admissions of his involvement in the drive-by shooting and of the offences for which he was sentenced. His admissions were the foundation of the case against him and as such were deserving of a significant discount. It remains that they were made in circumstances, which included his knowledge that he was under investigation. The fact of investigation may itself provide a degree of pressure on an individual, who is not to know what evidence the police may hold or, indeed, whether confederates may elect to assist the police in order to better their own position.  
     
      
    5 None of this is to say that the respondent’s assistance to the police involving his admission of guilt of the subject offences was not of a high order. In my opinion an overall reduction of 50 percent in the sentence was an appropriate reflection of this high level of assistance and the pleas of guilty absent the need for moderation in order to preserve proportionality in circumstances in which the respondent was entitled to a further discount for future assistance. I do not read Latham J’s discussion in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; 172 A Crim R 151 at 167 [54] of the range of discounts for assistance as excluding cases in which the offender has admitted his or her guilt of offences which the Crown may not otherwise be able to prove: see, too, SZ v R and Lewins v R [2007] NSWCCA 189. There is no fixed tariff for assistance and it is accepted that there will be cases where, exceptionally, a combined discount will exceed 50 percent. A case such as Ellis in which a person who is not the subject of investigation comes forward and confesses to an offence from motives of conscience may call for exceptional leniency. I do not consider that this case is in that category and to my mind the separation of the discount on Ellis principles from the balance of the discount for assistance to the authorities is susceptible of producing an overall discount for past assistance that is excessive.  
     
      
    6 The task of analysing the sentence in order to assess the extent to which the discount for past assistance may have been moderated to accommodate the requirement of proportionality is not without difficulty. Counsel for the respondent emphasised that the assistance given at the time of sentence included that the respondent had given evidence on behalf of the Crown on three occasions. On two of these occasions the evidence was given at the committal hearing. Any discount reflecting that assistance was no doubt closely bound up with the respondent’s undertaking to assist the Crown by giving evidence at the trial. The evidence given by the respondent on 18 and 19 July 2005 was at the committal hearing of Ken Tan and others for the drive-by shooting at the Frangieh residence. The respondent had received a form of indemnity from the Attorney General with respect to his own involvement in that offence and this was a benefit that the Judge may be assumed to have taken into account in accordance with s 23(2)(f). 7 In R v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87 Wood CJ at CL emphasised the importance of the mechanism provided by s 5DA to the operation of the criminal justice system. His Honour observed that subject to exceptional circumstances, those who received the benefit of undertakings by way of a discounted sentence could expect to have their sentences increased if they renege on their undertaking. Accepting the force of Simpson J’s analysis but concluding, as I do, that the assumed moderation in the discount for past assistance was of the order of 10 per cent and that the respondent has had the benefit of a 60 percent reduction in sentence, I would have favoured allowing the appeal and increasing the sentence by 10 per cent. However, given that through no fault of the respondent, the appeal did not come on for hearing until a matter of days before the expiration of the non-parole period, I agree that it is appropriate in the exercise of discretion to dismiss the appeal.8 SIMPSON J: This is a Crown appeal brought pursuant to s 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5DA Appeal by Crown against reduced sentence for assistance to authorities 
         
        (1) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking. 
         
        (2) On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit. 
         
        (3) A reference in subsection (1) to a sentence imposed on a person includes a reference to a sentence that was varied or imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
        
       
      
    9 The respondent faced five charges. On 4 March and 24 May 2005 respectively he entered pleas of guilty in Penrith and Central Local Courts to two counts of aggravated break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence, both committed during the evening of 1 October 2002 and the early hours of the following morning; on 12 August 2005 in the District Court at Sydney he pleaded guilty to all three counts on an indictment. These charges were of aggravated detention for advantage (the circumstance of aggravation being that the offence was committed in company); one count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do so; and robbery in company. The first and second of these were committed as part of a single enterprise on 19 November 2003; the third on 23 August 2003.  
     
      
    10 On 30 September 2005 Finnane DCJ sentenced the respondent on all counts. He partially accumulated the sentences imposed, giving an end result of a total term of imprisonment for 6½ years with a non-parole period of 2½ years, dating from 30 September 2005. The respondent is eligible for release on parole on 29 March 2008.  
     
      
    11 Finnane DCJ specified that an appropriate total term was of a head sentence of 10 years. From this, in reaching the sentence ultimately imposed, he allowed the respondent a combined discount, in respect of his pleas of guilty, the principles stated in R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, assistance to authorities already given, and anticipated assistance to law enforcement authorities, of 60 percent. It is the Crown case on the appeal that the respondent had undertaken to provide such assistance in the future and that he failed to fulfil that undertaking. On behalf of the respondent it was conceded that he did fail to honour the undertaking that he had given. The jurisdiction in this Court to intervene is therefore triggered. However, the exercise of the jurisdiction remains discretionary, and it was argued that sound reasons exist for the Court to decline to re-sentence the respondent. 
     
      
    12 The issues which arise are thus within a relatively narrow compass. However, it is necessary to set out some background facts and material.  
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    13 Chronologically, the first offences were those committed on 1-2 October 2002, the two offences of aggravated break and enter. There does not appear to be any comprehensive statement of agreed facts concerning these offences. However, as Finnane DCJ recounted the facts he must have had some material before him. The following is drawn from the Remarks on Sentence. At the time of these offences, the respondent was employed as a youth or social worker. He believed that two individuals were supplying drugs to children he was trying to help. Intoxicated, he and another man travelled to the flat in which those individuals lived, smashed an entry to the premises, and smashed down some internal doors. He took the female victim (who told him that she was pregnant), by the neck, squeezed her, and punched her to the ground, and told her to stay there. He and his co-offender punched the male victim and hit him with a small bedside table. They left, and returned later to continue the violence, on which occasion they were arrested. 
     
      
    14 The next two offences, of aggravated detention and malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm were committed as part of a continuing enterprise on 19 November 2002, in the following circumstances. In October 2002 the respondent was serving, by way of periodic detention, a sentence of imprisonment. He became friendly with another sentenced prisoner, Ken Tan. Another prisoner was a man called Cameron West. A dispute arose between Tan and West, as a result of which Tan resolved to assault West and cause him injury. He enlisted the aid of three others, including the respondent, who, in turn, recruited two more men.  
     
      
    15 In order to locate West, the respondent and two companions travelled to an address where they knew that another man, Jacky Ferrer, lived. They believed that Ferrer could give them West’s residential address. The respondent was armed with a small baseball bat, given to him by Tan. Tan was armed with a mallet or sledgehammer. 
     
      
    16 At Ferrer’s home, Tan, carrying the mallet, forced Ferrer out of the house and into one of the vehicles in which the group had travelled. They then, with Ferrer’s assistance, drove to West’s address. Tan required Ferrer to telephone West and tell him to come to the vehicle. The remaining participants waited in the vehicles, or concealed themselves nearby. West emerged from his apartment building, and walked towards the vehicles. Tan, carrying the mallet, and the respondent, carrying the baseball bat, assaulted West. Tan struck him approximately 10 times around the upper body and legs; the respondent struck him once in the head and once in the arms with the baseball bat. The respondent and other offenders held West down while Tan resumed striking him with the mallet. By this time West was bleeding profusely from the head and face. The assault continued for approximately five minutes until a nearby member of the public intervened. The group dispersed. 
     
      
    17 West suffered a fracture to the jawbone, a wound to the head that required 60 stitches, multiple scalp lacerations, severe bruising to the rib cage, right knee and left ankle. A blood clot developed. He was later diagnosed as suffering from post traumatic stress. 
     
      
    18 The events concerning Ferrer constitute the first offence on the indictment, of kidnapping. The assault on West constitutes the second offence on the indictment, of malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. 
     
      
    19 The final offence was committed on 23 August 2003. The respondent, at the request of Tan, with four others, drove one of two vehicles to the Dee Why Day and Night Pharmacy. The purpose of the excursion was to obtain, at Tan’s request, Sudafed. The respondent remained in the vehicle while others entered the pharmacy. One was carrying a short curved sword. Their faces were disguised with balaclavas. A number of staff and customers were in the store. One customer, who attempted to protect his young son, was forced to the ground by one of the offenders. Other offenders stole wallets and purses from customers and money from the cash register. The men obtained 12 boxes of Sudafed. This constituted the third offence on the indictment, of robbery in company. 
     
      
    20 Following these events, in early 2004, the respondent travelled to New Zealand, where he was born (although his family was of Tongan ethnicity). He had not then been arrested or charged in respect of the three later offences. It appears that NSW Police also travelled to New Zealand, for the purpose of interviewing the respondent. The respondent did then provide them with information in respect of a variety of offences they were investigating. Finnane DCJ observed that it was information provided by the respondent himself that enabled police to pursue the charges against the respondent, and that without that information, it was doubtful that he could be charged with any of them. That is why the respondent was entitled to a reduction in sentence on Ellis principles; in the circumstances, that reduction was of significant dimension. 
     
      
    21 In May 2005 the respondent gave evidence in a trial of four men on charges of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent; in July of the same year he gave evidence in two different committal proceedings. One involved charges of concealing information relating to a murder. 
     
      
    22 It was not suggested on behalf of the Crown that this evidence was other than satisfactory.  
     
      
    23 On 12 August 2005 the respondent signed an undertaking to give evidence at any proceedings involving 12 named suspects, and 7 separate offences, including one of murder in which Tan was said to have been involved. The undertaking extended to giving active cooperation to police, and to give evidence in accordance with 11 statements made by him over a period between 9 December 2003 and 11 July 2005 and two recorded interviews, made in February 2004. (From this it can be seen that the respondent was giving actual cooperation to police over a period of more than a year.) Evidence and argument relevant to sentence were heard on the same day, 12 August 2005. 
     
      
    24 The respondent was sentenced by Finnane DCJ on 30 September 2005 to the overall term mentioned above, of 6½ years with a non-parole period of 2½ years. Since no complaint is made by either party in respect of the manner in which he was sentenced it is unnecessary to take time here setting out the individual sentences. What is material is the course his Honour took in relation to the assistance the respondent had already given, and, more particularly, assistance to be given in the future. Before his Honour was an affidavit setting out in some detail the nature of the assistance. It has, in accordance with usual practice, been placed in a sealed envelope. It has been viewed and considered by this Court. It is sufficient here to note that the affidavit discloses very extensive cooperation by the respondent, in respect of a large area of criminal activity. 
     
      
    25 As I read the Remarks on Sentence, his Honour determined that, absent any discounts, the overall sentence to be imposed ought to be a head sentence of 10 years. (He did not specify into what proportions he would, hypothetically, have divided the total sentence into a non-parole period and a parole period.) He reduced that to an overall head sentence of 4 years with a non-parole period of 2½ years – a reduction, overall, of 60 percent. This reduction was attributable to, in combination, the pleas of guilty, the respondent’s own disclosure of his guilt of crimes that could not otherwise have been brought home to him (Ellis), assistance already given, and assistance anticipated to be provided by the respondent by giving evidence in accordance with his undertaking in proceedings against the various men there named and in respect of the charges there identified. 
     
      
    26 His Honour then said that, should the respondent fail to give evidence in accordance with this undertaking, the sentence ought to be increased by 20 percent. This is a fair indication – and it was accepted by both parties – that the discount allowed for future assistance was of that order. 
     
      
    27 As I have indicated, on behalf of the respondent it was conceded that he failed to honour the undertaking. In fact, he has been called to give evidence on five occasions; in September, October and November 2006, and in May and June 2007. On each of those occasions he failed to fulfil the undertaking by failing to give evidence in accordance with the relevant statement. These occasions do not include the murder charge. That matter has not come to trial. Indeed, committal proceedings have not yet taken place. 
     
      
    28 The respondent has provided no explanation for his failure to comply with his undertaking. 
     
      
    29 Opposition to the orders sought by the Crown is advanced on a purely discretionary basis. That the power conferred on this Court by s 5DA(2) is discretionary is clear: see R v O’Brien (unreported, NSWCCA, 10 June 1993) per Gleeson CJ; R v El-Sayed [2003] NSWCCA 232. 
     
      
    30 One discretionary circumstance advanced on behalf of the respondent concerns what is said to be “a substantial delay” in bringing the Crown appeal. The respondent’s undertaking to give evidence was given on 12 August 2005. He was not called to give evidence until September 2006. However, it is hardly surprising that the various proceedings did not come on for hearing at the time of the undertaking or immediately thereafter. The exigencies of court listings are well known. There is no suggestion that the Crown was in any way responsible for the gap between the date the respondent signed his undertaking, and the occasions on which he was called to give evidence.  
     
      
    31 On behalf of the respondent reliance was also placed upon the date that the Crown appeal was signed, 20 December 2007. That is 15 months after his first being called, and 6 months after the last occasion. That circumstance has added poignancy because the respondent’s non-parole period will expire on 29 March, just 11 days after the date fixed for the hearing of the Crown appeal. There has been no express explanation for the timing of the filing of the Crown appeal. However, it is not difficult to appreciate why this occurred as it did. It was not until the respondent had been given an opportunity to meet his undertaking by giving evidence in the relevant proceedings that the extent of his failure to honour it can be clearly seen.  
     
      
    32 In my opinion the Crown was well within its rights to withhold filing the appeal until the position concerning the respondent and his willingness to give evidence was fully crystallised. In fact, even now, that has not happened – the respondent has not been called to give evidence in the murder proceedings, but, given that committal proceedings have not yet taken place, it would be inappropriate for there to be any further deferral of the Crown appeal. The Crown cannot justifiably be criticised for the timing of the occasions giving rise to the failure to give evidence or the timing of the filing of the appeal. I do not think that the delay, as it is called, is of any real significance in the overall circumstances. 
     
      
    33 A second, and intriguing, argument was advanced on behalf of the respondent. In a nutshell, it was that, by reason of the extent of the respondent’s cooperation, both with authorities, by disclosure of his own criminality, and his pleas of guilty, the reduction in sentence allowed to him was proportionally less than would have been the case had his cooperation been less. I will attempt to explain how this comes about. 
     
      
    34 The discretion to reduce sentences by reason of assistance to authorities, which was initially considered in this Court in R v Perez-Vargas (1986) 8 NSWLR 559 and recognised in R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 has received statutory endorsement and formalisation in s 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Sub-section (3) of that section expressly provides that any such reduction must not result in a sentence that is unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    35 Here, the total reduction allowed to the respondent was at the very highest end of the range sanctioned by this Court. For example, in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; 172 A Crim R 151 Latham J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “54 While there is no fixed tariff for assistance to the authorities, discounts customarily ranged between 20 percent and 50 percent. There have been comparatively rare cases where a discount in the order of 55 percent or 60 percent has been given. Generally speaking however, a discount of 50 percent is regarded as appropriate to assistance of a very high order. No doubt, that is in part a reflection of the principle that a discount for assistance must not produce a result which is disproportionate to the objective gravity of a particular offence and the circumstances of a particular offender.” 
        
       
       
      In referring to a discount of 50 percent, Latham J was concerned only with the reduction attributable to assistance to authorities. Nevertheless, by reason of s 23(3) and the general sentencing principle of proportionality, a ceiling is effectively placed upon the extent to which a sentence may be reduced in any given case. This is an inevitable consequence of the need to ensure that an offender serves a period of imprisonment appropriate and proportionate to his or her criminality. But there is a hidden consequence of that circumstance: an offender who has conducted himself or herself in such a way as would justify cumulative reductions will lose, by the application of that overriding principle of sentencing practice, some of the benefit of those reductions. That is because the accumulation of a number of discounts on reductions will produce a total. That, when applied to the appropriate notional starting point, will result in a sentence that collides with s 23(3) and the principle of proportionality. Ordinarily, this would be of little import. The principle of proportionality must prevail. That is so even where an offender may be entitled to cumulative discounts under a variety of heads. Where accumulation of discounts that would ordinarily be applicable produces a sentence that is disproportionately low in relation to the objective criminality, it is the discounts, and not the sentence, that must give away. This does not mean that the offender is denied a discount under any particular head; in practice what happens is a compression of the individual discounts so that each is proportionately reduced to less than would otherwise be allowed. 
       
      
    36 But the issue arises sharply in rare cases, of which the present is one. The argument calls for some unravelling of what Finnane DCJ did. If it is the case that the respondent’s reduction in sentence was itself reduced for proportionality reasons, then it would not necessarily be just to deprive him of that to which he might otherwise have been entitled, when part of the reason for his not having received it evaporates. In case that is not clear, I will state it this way. In El-Sayed, at [34], I hypothesised that an offender who declined to assist because of threats made would not be entitled to a reduction; and that an offender who resiled from an undertaking to give evidence because of threats could not be in any better position. 
     
      
    37 But the argument also cuts the other way. If – and I emphasise if – the discount allowed to an offender by reason of past assistance is reduced because he/she has also undertaken to provide future assistance, but the proportionality principle operates to moderate the discount that would otherwise have been allowed, then, if the basis for the moderation evaporates, the offender is (at least arguably) entitled to be returned to the position he/she would have been in had that moderation not been imposed. 
     
      
    38 That is why I say that the argument calls for some unravelling of Finnane DCJ’s approach to the sentence. Was the discount attributable to past assistance in fact reduced in order to accommodate or recognise s 23(3) and/or the principle of proportionality? Counsel for the respondent argued that it could be inferred that, apart from the provisions of s 23(3), the respondent might well have benefited from an even greater reduction. In other words, the reduction he was given referable to past assistance, and that referable to future assistance, were both moderated or compressed in order to accommodate the necessary proportion between the objective seriousness of the offences and the ultimate total sentence. Consideration of this argument also has to take into account the other discounts, for the pleas of guilty and the Ellis principles, to which he was entitled. 
     
      
    39 The issue can be tested this way: had the respondent not offered an undertaking to give evidence, but, nevertheless, having provided the information, by way of statements and interviews that he did, would his combined discount for Ellis principles, pleas of guilty, and that past assistance have been greater than 40 percent? Or should this Court infer that the reduction for past assistance was itself reduced by reason of the requirements of s 23(3) and proportionality? If the answer to that question is affirmative, there is much to be said for the proposition that, if he loses the discount allowed for future assistance the moderation of the discount for past assistance ought also be removed. If that were so, then it is a circumstance potentially relevant to the exercise of this Court’s discretion under s 5DA. 
     
      
    40 There is, of course, no application for leave to appeal by the respondent, and this Court is not reviewing the reduction allowed by Finnane DCJ. That does not, in my opinion, preclude this Court considering whether the constraints of s 23(3) and/or proportionality impacted upon the extent of the reduction to which the respondent would have been entitled, or which he would have been allowed, had there been no offer of future assistance. I note that there is no sign in the Remarks that the judge did feel so constrained; but it is not immaterial that the discount in fact allowed was at the very top of the range ordinarily permitted. 
     
      
    41 I have, after some hesitation, come to the view that it is open to the Court to consider the question in that limited way, as relevant to the exercise of this Court’s discretion under s 5DA. 
     
      
    42 The affidavit to which I have referred details quite extensive information provided by the respondent. The extent of the reduction is to be measured against the value to law enforcement authorities of the assistance given: for example, has it provided avenues for investigation or leads which, even without evidence given by the offender, might lead to, or help to lead to, the solving of outstanding crimes? The affidavit is not especially helpful in that respect.  
     
      
    43 I have after careful consideration, come to the view that the submission made on behalf of the respondent has been made good.  
     
      
    44 He was plainly entitled to a reduction, in respect of the pleas of guilty alone, at the high end of the range postulated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. That is, at minimum, 20 percent, and at maximum 25 percent. He was entitled to more by reason of his voluntary disclosure of his own offences such as to enable police to prosecute him, something that, absent his information, they would not have been in a position to do. I will hypothesise that reduction as a further 10 percent. That leads to a discount of 30-35 percent, even without consideration of assistance, already given or promised. We know that Finnane DCJ allowed another 20 percent in respect of the undertaking to give evidence. That totals a reduction of 50-55 percent without any reference to past assistance. Simple mathematics shows that that leaves an allowance of 5-10 percent for only past assistance. (Since preparing these reasons, I have read in draft the judgment of Bell JA. I wish to emphasise that, in what I have said above, I do not intend to encourage any practice of identifying discrete discounts, and accumulating them. The exercise in which I have just engaged was an attempt to identify, as nearly as possible, the process by which Finnane DCJ arrived at his final sentence. It was a hypothetical untangling of a process which is necessarily largely instinctive, but incorporating recognised legal principle.) 
     
      
    45 Perusal of the affidavit satisfies me that the assistance already given by the respondent, if taken alone, warranted and indeed called for a considerably greater reduction than 5-10 percent. The combination of discounts to which the respondent was entitled meant that each had to be compressed in order to preserve proportionality. That would not have been the case had the promise of future assistance never been made – the respondent would, in my opinion, have been entitled to a considerably greater level of discount for the assistance already given. 
     
      
    46 It appears that the respondent did afford a significant degree of cooperation to the authorities – he had made statements on no less than 11 occasions, and participated in 2 recorded interviews. He gave evidence in proceedings on three occasions before giving his undertaking on 12 August. Had the undertaking in respect of future assistance not been given, his sentence would, in all likelihood (in my opinion) have been reduced, in recognition of his past assistance alone, by a significantly greater proportion than 5-10 percent. 
     
      
    47 In my opinion, in respect of the past assistance alone, and without the imposition of the restraint required by the proportionality principle in order to avoid the disproportionate sentence that would result from accumulating a further reduction for further assistance, the respondent could have expected a benefit of at least 25-30 percent. Given that he must now lose the benefit of the 20 percent attributable to future assistance, there is no reason why that moderation of the reduction for past assistance ought to be perpetuated. It would not be fair, in my opinion, to deprive him of the discount for future assistance without restoring to him that part of the discount for past assistance that he lost by reason of the compression. Just as in El-Sayed, an offender who failed to give promised assistance by reason of threats made to him after his promise could not be in a better position than an offender who made no such promise because threats were received before such a promise was made, so an offender who surrenders a benefit by reason of failure to fulfil a promise to give evidence ought not to be in a worse position than he/she would have been in, had the promise never been made. I emphasise that this is not to review the assessments made by the sentencing judge; those assessments were perfectly appropriate in the circumstances that then existed; it is to consider the proper exercise of the discretion of this Court. 
     
      
    48 If the discount for past assistance, assessed at 25-30 percent is added to the 30-35 percent to which he was already entitled, a total discount of 55-65 percent is produced – still well above the levels that this Court has approved, and calling for moderation. 
     
      
    49 In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that, if the respondent is (as I believe he must) to lose the 20 percent reduction allowed for future assistance, he is entitled to have restored that part of the discount for past assistance to which he would have been entitled, and of which, I infer, he was deprived by compression by reason of the proportionality rule. In my opinion, that is at least equal to the 20 percent allowed for the future. But even if it were not, and the circumstances called for an increase in penalty, although less than 20 percent, I would, in this case, favour dismissing the Crown appeal. It is not to be overlooked that the respondent’s eligibility for release on parole is imminent. While the delay has not been the fault of the Crown, it has also not been the fault of the respondent. To seize from him an imminent possible release date at this late stage would be very harsh indeed. For these reasons, in the exercise of the Court’s discretion, I propose that the Crown appeal be dismissed.50 ADAMS J: I agree with the judgment of Simpson J subject to the following qualification. This case demonstrates the desirability of the approach that I advocated in my judgment in Regina v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342; 167 A Crim R 436. In my opinion, the better approach is not to roll up the various discounts into a single undifferentiated number, but to specify each discount and apply each to the sentence in succession. If the result is a sentence that is inappropriately lenient, it should then be adjusted upwards by reference to s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In this way a more predictable reward for the various kinds of public benefit will develop and different cases can rationally be compared. The other method, which either does not assess the discount applicable to each mode of assistance but simply specifies a total or conceals the calculation, merely mystifies what public policy – quite apart from other principles of criminal justice – requires to be clear. With unfeigned respect for those who differ, I cannot see any advantage deriving from such an approach.

     SENTENCE 
    Introduction1 On Monday 11 February 2008, I found that the Crown had proved its case against Mr Alan Jones, Harbour Radio Pty Ltd and News Ltd. News Ltd did not wish to be heard on the penalty imposed by the learned Magistrate. Accordingly, I dismissed its appeal and confirmed the conviction and penalty.2 The position of News Ltd and the other appellants was different. News Ltd did not contest the fact that it did not have consent to publish the name of the child witness, nor did it seek to assert that it had an honest, but reasonably mistaken belief that it was entitled to publish the name. Its only claim before me was that the Crown had not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the child was under the age of 18 years. Its submission on penalty was undoubtedly correct and proper.The cases of Mr Jones and Harbour Radio Pty Ltd3 I have now heard submissions on penalty on behalf of Mr Jones and Harbour Radio Pty Ltd.Crown submissions4 The Crown has urged that I should impose penalties on Mr Jones of a fine and a bond under sec 9 of the Crime (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (Referred to in this Judgment as sec.9 – see Appendix for full text). It has said that Harbour Radio Pty Ltd had a duty to ensure that those who broadcast on it did not breach the law. The learned magistrate had imposed a fine on Sydney Harbour Radio Pty Ltd.5 It has sought to urge that the sentencing options available in the sentencing on 5th September 2000 of Mr John Laws, a former broadcaster, following his conviction for an offence of soliciting information from a juror, were relevant to the sentence to be imposed on Mr Jones. The Crown also submitted that Mr Jones had been convicted of contempt of court on 19th March 1993 in respect of broadcasts made by him on 9th and 10th July 1990 and thus, he could not be said to have a previously blameless record.6 The Crown has urged that I should not impose a bond under sec. 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999 (referred to in this Judgment as sec. 10 – see Appendix for full text) without recording a conviction. It has submitted that this sentence would not reflect the elements of general and specific deterrence, denunciation and retribution.Submissions on behalf of Mr Jones and Sydney Harbour Radio Pty Ltd7 Those representing Mr Jones and Harbour Radio Pty Ltd have submitted that I should, without proceeding to conviction, dismiss the charges pursuant to sec 10. Counsel have submitted that a conviction of Mr Jones would have permanent and far reaching consequences because of the requirement to disclose such a record when travelling and counsel has informed me that Mr Jones travels widely.8 Submissions were made on behalf of Mr Jones that he gives generously of his time to charities and helps to raise money for those in the community who are less well off. References about his good character were tendered to the learned magistrate. All came from citizens of prominence and all were impressive. I know two of the referees personally, Mr Geoff Schuberg, a former Assistant Commissioner of Police and Mr Brett Walker S.C., a barrister. My association in both cases has been a largely professional one. My decision 9 For reasons which I set out below, I have decided that in the proper exercise of discretion I should dismiss these cases pursuant to the provisions of sec 10.10 It is not appropriate to impose a sec 10 Bond, because there is no reason to think that Mr Jones would again make the mistake of publishing the name of a witness in a criminal trial who was a minor, unless he was personally satisfied that it was lawful to do so. It would seem to me most improbable that he would ever again rely on what someone else had done, without checking carefully whether that person or organization was entitled to do what it had done.Reasons for my decision11 There are four factors to which a court must have regard when considering whether to find an offence proved but to dismiss it pursuant to sec 10. Those four factors are:a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition,b) the trivial nature of the offence,c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed,d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider.12 Those factors are disjunctive and non –exhaustive. When a Judge comes to consider the application of sec 10, the fact that the offence is not trivial does not mean that he cannot impose a sec 10 dismissal; since that is just one of the factors (See R v Paris [2001] NSWCCA 83).13 In the present case I take into account that informing the world of W’s name in a radio comment extending over less than a few minutes, did not materially add to the damage already caused by the actions of News Limited in publishing an article in the Daily Telegraph. In my opinion, the Daily Telegraph publication was much more serious, since it contained in written form the prohibited name and revealed it to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of readers of that newspaper. What was printed still exists in any copies of that newspaper that have been preserved.14 Whilst it was no excuse from liability in law that Mr Jones relied on the Daily Telegraph, the fact that he did to some extent ameliorates the seriousness of the offence. I have also found that he acted honestly, and that he had a belief that what he was doing was lawful, but this belief was not based on reasonable grounds. The learned magistrate imposed penalties on him for acting dishonestly.15 In my opinion, if he had not been acting honestly, the sentence imposed by the learned magistrate would have been one that was available in the proper exercise of discretion, since it would have been committed in clear breach of the law, but since I have come to a decision that Mr Jones is not dishonest then it is appropriate that I impose a sentence that reflects that finding.16 I considered carefully the Crown submission that I should impose a sec 9 bond and a fine, but I do not think it appropriate to impose a fine or require Mr Jones to enter a sec 9 Bond.17 A sec 9 bond is something which should only be imposed as an alternative punishment to imprisonment. It is not relevant unless imprisonment is a realistic option. In my opinion, imprisonment could only rarely be an appropriate sentence for an offence where the perpetrator acted honestly, but with an unreasonably mistaken belief. If imprisonment is not appropriate, then it is not appropriate to impose a sentence in lieu of imprisonment18 The Crown also submitted that I should take into account his conviction for a contempt of court committed in 1990 and penalised in 1993. I have considered the materials provided in relation to that matter. However, this offence is far removed from the facts of that contempt of court. It had no tendency to interfere with the administration of justice and was part of a quick comment, unlike the contempt of court which arose out of interviews conducted on radio over two days.19 The Crown also submitted that the consequences which should be visited on Mr Jones had some relevant comparison to those imposed on Mr John Laws for an offence of interviewing a juror. I do not agree. What Mr Laws did was something which threw doubt on the correctness of a jury verdict in a serious criminal trial and it thus had a tendency to interfere with the administration of justice. What Mr Jones did, could not be compared in any way with this. Mr Jones is a man of good character who has done and continues to do work which is of value to the community. I do not consider his conviction for contempt of court in 1990 derogates from this.Reflection on sec 10.20 The words of sec 10 make it plain as I have already said that I must consider the four factors. Mr Jones is a man of good character, but the offence is not a trivial one. It was not committed in extenuating circumstances, but at the same time he had an honest but not reasonably mistaken belief that he was entitled to publish the name. As a man of good character and someone who gives much of his time to charitable and community activities, a conviction could have an adverse effect on him which would be disproportionate to the seriousness of the offence. He is unlikely to commit any such offence again. 21 Harbour Radio Pty Ltd is entitled to the same sentence as that of Mr Jones.For these reasons, in my opinion, the appropriate sentence which I now pronounce is:In the appeal of Alan Belford Jones:22 I uphold the appeal.23 I confirm the finding of guilt made by the learned magistrate, but pursuant to sec 10(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, without proceeding to conviction I direct that the charge against Alan Belford Jones be dismissed.In the appeal of Sydney Harbour Radio:24 I uphold the appeal.25 I confirm the finding of guilt made by the learned magistrate, but pursuant to sec 10(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, without proceeding to conviction I direct that the charge against Sydney Harbour Radio Pty Ltd be dismissedAppendixCrimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999

        (1) Instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment on an offender, a court may make an order directing the offender to enter into a good behaviour bond for a specified term. 
         
         
        (2) The term of a good behaviour bond must not exceed 5 years. 
         
         
        (3) This section is subject to the provisions of Part 8. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
     
     
      
      10 Dismissal of charges and conditional discharge of offender 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) Without proceeding to conviction, a court that finds a person guilty of an offence may make any one of the following orders: 
         
        (a) an order directing that the relevant charge be dismissed, 
         
        (b) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding 2 years, 
         
        (c) an order discharging the person on condition that the person enter into an agreement to participate in an intervention program and to comply with any intervention plan arising out of the program. 
         
         
        (2) An order referred to in subsection (1) (b) may be made if the court is satisfied: 
         
        (a) that it is inexpedient to inflict any punishment (other than nominal punishment) on the person, or 
         
        (b) that it is expedient to release the person on a good behaviour bond. 
         
         
        (2A) An order referred to in subsection (1) (c) may be made if the court is satisfied that it would reduce the likelihood of the person committing further offences by promoting the treatment or rehabilitation of the person. 
         
         
        (2B) Subsection (1) (c) is subject to Part 8C. 
         
         
        (3) In deciding whether to make an order referred to in subsection (1), the court is to have regard to the following factors: 
         
        (a) the person’s character, antecedents, age, health and mental condition, 
         
        (b) the trivial nature of the offence, 
         
        (c) the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was committed, 
         
        (d) any other matter that the court thinks proper to consider. 
         
         
        (4) An order under this section has the same effect as a conviction: 
         
        (a) for the purposes of any law with respect to the revesting or restoring of stolen property, and 
         
        (b) for the purpose of enabling a court to give directions for compensation under Part 4 of the  
        Victims Compensation Act 1996 
        , and 
         
        (c) for the purpose of enabling a court to give orders with respect to the restitution or delivery of property or the payment of money in connection with the restitution or delivery of property. 
         
         
        (5) A person with respect to whom an order under this section is made has the same right to appeal on the ground that the person is not guilty of the offence as the person would have had if the person had been convicted of the offence.

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: As to the sentencing of Zhen Chi Chen.1 The offender is Zhen Chi Chen. He is known as Peter Chen. He was born on 20 October 1965. He was aged about thirty-eight years when he committed the subject offence, for which I am to impose sentence upon him, and he is aged forty-two years five months now. 2 The offender is the third child of his parents’ four children. He has an older brother and an older sister and a younger sister. His parents and his siblings are alive. He has a close relationship with his parents and siblings.3 The offender was born in a small rural village in Guangdong Province in China. His parents were farmers. He and his siblings were raised in a happy and supportive environment. 4 The offender attended primary and secondary schools in Guangdong Province. He was an average student academically. He obtained the Chinese equivalent of the New South Wales year twelve Higher School Certificate.5 After leaving school, the offender left mainland China and went to Hong Kong, at where he was employed in a restaurant business of his older sister.6 In 1989, after five years in Hong Kong, the offender migrated to Australia, settling in Sydney. In due course, his parents and sisters migrated to Australia. His parents live in Sydney. One of his sisters lives in Sydney, but I do not know where his other sister lives. His brother lives in Hong Kong.7 After arriving in Australia, the offender obtained employment in a business of a relative. In due course, he established his own seafood business, purchasing and canning abalone and supplying it to restaurants in Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong and China.8 The offender married his wife during 2006 and his wife gave birth to their first child during July 2007. His wife and their child are dependent upon him.9 The offender enjoys good physical and mental health, albeit that he is anxious about the sentence that will be imposed upon him and the effect that his imprisonment will have upon his parents, his wife, and his child. Notwithstanding the conclusion of the psychiatrist, I am not prepared to accept that the offender suffers depression or that, if he does, it will make imprisonment for him more onerous than it otherwise should be.10 The offender has not abused intoxicating liquor or any prohibited drug and he does not have any gambling problem.11 The offender has an unblemished character and reputation. 12 At some time before May 2003 the AFP and the Australian Crime Commission became interested in the affairs of Bin Huang and, through him, the affairs of the offender. 13 From mid January 2003 Mr Huang had attended at various branches of the Commonwealth Bank and the Westpac bank around Sydney and he had transferred various amounts of money, all less than $10,000, in cash, to the accounts of various people, six in all, one of whom was the brother of the offender, at banks, four in all, in Hong Kong.14 On various occasions between 30 May 2003 and 2 December 2003 police seconded from the New South Wales police force to the Australian Crime Commission followed Mr Huang from 141 Ninth Avenue, Belfield, to various branches of the Commonwealth Bank and the Westpac bank around Sydney at where he transferred amounts of money to the accounts of the people at banks in Hong Kong.15 On 19 August 2003 an officer of the Australian Crime Commission installed a fixed camera on premises opposite 141 Ninth Avenue, Belfield, which premises were occupied by the offender and his parents, to record the comings of people into and the goings of people from 141 Ninth Avenue, Belfield.16 Between 4 September 2003 and 17 December 2003 the telephone landline into 141 Ninth Avenue, Belfield, was monitored and conversations and facsimile transmissions on the landline were intercepted and recorded. 17 Between 9 January 2004 and 20 February 2004 the telephone landline into 19 Passey Avenue, Belmore, into which premises the offender and his parents had moved after leaving 141 Ninth Avenue, Belfield, was monitored and conversations and facsimile transmissions on the landline were intercepted and recorded.18 On 1 March 2005 the offender was arrested and, after being arrested, he was taken to the Surry Hills police station, at where he was charged with, inter alia, the offence of dealing with money of $1,000,000 or more intending it to be an instrument of crime and, after being charged, he was remanded in custody, bail refused, to appear before a magistrate in the Central Local Court in Sydney on 2 March 2005.19 In about October 2005 Mr Huang was arrested and, after being arrested, he, like the offender, was charged with an offence of dealing with money of $1,000,000 or more intending it to be an instrument of crime. 20 On 11 December 2005, 3 February 2006, 15 March 2006, and 11 May 2006 Mr Huang was interviewed by officers of the Australian Crime Commission about the various amounts of money that he had transferred to the accounts of people at banks in Hong Kong. 21 In course of time, on 17 February 2006 the offender was granted bail and on 20 February 2006 the offender was released from prison. He had been in prison, bail refused, from his arrest on 1 March 2005 to 20 February 2006, a period of 11 months 20 days. 22 On 14 June 2006 Mr Huang was interviewed again about the money that he had transferred to accounts of people at banks in Hong Kong. On this occasion he was shown a total of 1,442 international money transfer application forms, of which he selected 333 as transactions that he had conducted, with the rest being transactions that he had not conducted or transactions that he had a doubt about whether he had conducted. He confirmed that the money that he had transferred overseas had been provided to him by the offender and that he had been instructed in the method that he was to use to transfer the money overseas by the offender.23 On 22 December 2006 the offender appeared before a magistrate in the Central Local Court at Sydney for a committal hearing. It was to be a paper committal hearing. Not surprisingly or unexpectedly, as the Crown’s case was not challenged, he was committed to appear in this court in the Downing Centre in Sydney on 25 January 2007 for arraignment.24 In due course, on 20 September 2007 the offender appeared before me in this court in the Downing Centre in Sydney to stand his trial. The Crown Prosecutor presented an indictment which charged the offender with the offence of dealing with money of $1,000,000 or more intending it to be an instrument of crime. The offender pleaded not guilty to the charge. A jury was empanelled.25 After the jury had been empanelled, but in the absence of the jury, I conducted a voir dire as to the admissibility of some evidence that the Crown Prosecutor wished to adduce and to which the offender objected. After hearing evidence and then submissions from the Crown Prosecutor and the offender's solicitor, I allowed the Crown Prosecutor to adduce some of the evidence to which objection was taken and refused to allow him to adduce some other of that evidence. 26 On 21 September 2007 the trial before the jury commenced. The jury heard evidence from twenty-two witnesses, all called by the Crown Prosecutor, and it received sixty-three exhibits, fifty-four presented by the Crown Prosecutor and nine presented by the offender's solicitor, over seventeen days between 21 September 2007 and 17 October 2007, the addresses of the Crown Prosecutor and the offender's solicitor over three days, 17 18 and 19 October 2007, my summing-up over two days, 19 and 22 October 2007, and it returned its verdict of guilty on 27 October 2007. After taking the jury’s verdict, I revoked the offender's bail and fixed 13 December 2007, later changed to 1 February 2008, for the sentencing proceedings. 27 The jury, by its verdict, must have accepted the evidence of Mr Huang that between 14 January 2003 and 4 November 2003 he had conducted 333 international money transfer transactions transferring overseas money amounting to $3,088,311 that had been provided to him by the offender using the method that the offender had instructed him to use, for the doing of which he was paid about $90.00 for each transaction that he conducted on behalf of the offender. 28 Although it is not for me to say whether or not the jury’s verdict is correct, I say that its verdict of guilty did not surprise me as the Crown’s case was strong to the point of being overwhelming, with Mr Huang’s evidence being, to some extent, corroborated and largely unexplained.29 On 1 February 2008 the offender appeared before me on the sentencing proceedings. I received documentary material from the Crown Prosecutor and the offender's senior counsel and I heard evidence from the offender's wife and submissions as to sentence from the Crown Prosecutor and the offender's senior counsel, after which I stood over the sentencing of the offender to today.30 I am now to impose sentence upon the offender for the offence of which the jury has found him to be guilty.31 The offence of dealing with money of $1,000,000 or more intending that it become an instrument of crime is an offence against s 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth), for which the prescribed penalty is imprisonment for a maximum of twenty-five years or a fine of a maximum of $165,000 or both. I think that it is obvious and fair to say that the offence committed by the offender is a very serious offence.32 The evidence presented to the jury allows me to find that:  
     
      
      (1)Mr Huang conducted 333 international money transfer transactions transferring various amounts of money, all less than $10,000, in cash, to the accounts of six people, one of whom was the brother of the offender, at four banks in Hong Kong. 
      
     
     
      
      (2)The transactions were conducted on various occasions over a period of about ten months from 14 January 2003 to 4 November 2003. 
      
     
     
      
      (3)The total amount of money transferred overseas by Mr Huang on behalf of the offender was $3,088,311. 
      
     
     
      
      (4)Mr Huang received the money that he transferred overseas from the offender. 
      
     
     
      
      (5)Mr Huang was instructed as to the method to be used by him to transfer the money overseas by the offender. 
      
     
     
      
      (6)Mr Huang reported to the offender about the money that he had transferred overseas. 
      
     
     
      
      (7)Mr Huang was paid about $90.00 by the offender for each transaction that he conducted for the offender. 
      
     
     
      
      (8)As between Mr Huang and the offender, Mr Huang was the agent and the offender was the principal in relation to the transactions conducted by Mr Huang. 
      
     
     
      
      (9)The offender's intention in providing Mr Huang with the money to be transferred overseas and in instructing Mr Huang as to the method to be used in transferring the money overseas was to avoid the cash reporting requirements of the  
      Financial Transactions Reports Act (Cth). 
      
    33 However, the evidence presented to the jury does not allow me to find that the money provided by the offender to Mr Huang to be transferred overseas by him was money that was either lawfully or unlawfully obtained by the offender or was money to which the offender was lawfully entitled or in which the offender had a lawful interest.34 As the offence committed by the offender is an offence against the law of the Commonwealth, I am required, in determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for the offence, to take into account the several factors set out in s 16A of the Crimes Act (Cth) and any other relevant factor.35 As to the factors set out in s 16A of the Crimes Act, I say these things. 
     
      
      (a) I have outlined the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed. 
      
     
     
      
      (b) I note that the subject offence is the only offence to be considered. 
      
     
     
      
      (c) I consider that the offence was a planned offence, which consisted of a series of criminal acts. 
      
     
     
      
      (d) I note that there was not any victim of the offence. 
      
     
     
      
      (e) I note that no one suffered any injury, loss or damage from the offence. 
      
     
     
      
      (f) I record that the offender has not shown any contrition for committing the offence. 
      
     
     
      
      (g) I record that the offender did not plead guilty to the offence. 
      
     
     
      
      (h) I note that the offender did not assist any law enforcement agency in the investigation of the offence or any other offence. 
      
     
     
      
      (j) I expect that the sentence will have a significant deterrent effect upon the offender. 
      
     
     
      
      (m) I have outlined the age, antecedents, employments, health and character of the offender. 
      
     
     
      
      (n) I accept that the offender has his family support but I cannot say whether he has a good or reasonable prospect for rehabilitation or whether he has a good or reasonable chance that he will not re-offend. 
      
     
     
      
      (p) I accept that the offender's imprisonment will have a significant effect upon his parents, his wife and his child, all of whom are dependent upon him, but this effect is not unusual or exceptional, rather it is usual and expected. 
      
    36 One factor not mentioned in s 16A of the Crimes Act is general deterrence. I see general deterrence as being very important. It is something that cannot be ignored or undervalued. People who may think of transferring amounts of money of less than $10,000 in cash so as to avoid the requirements of the Financial Transactions Reports Act and so as to avoid detection of the money must be deterred from doing so by the sure and certain knowledge that, upon detection, and after conviction, a sentence of imprisonment is likely to be imposed.37 Another factor not mentioned in s 16A of the Crimes Act is parity between Mr Huang and the offender. Mr Huang was charged with the same offence as that with which the offender was charged. Mr Huang assisted the Australian Crime Commission in the investigation of the offence.38 Mr Huang pleaded guilty to the offence. Mr Huang offered to assist the Crown in the prosecution of the offender. Mr Huang was accepted to have been “a runner” or “a courier” for the offender, albeit to have been “a trusted employee” who “played an important role”, and to have been contrite for what he did. Mr Huang was sentenced at first instance to imprisonment for three years, with a non-parole period of one year nine months and a parole period of one year three months. However, on appeal by the Crown, on the ground of inadequacy, Mr Huang was sentenced to imprisonment for five years six months, with a non-parole period of three years four months and a parole period of two years two months.39 In giving its judgment (see 2007 NSWCCA 259) the Court of Criminal Appeal said (in paragraph 44) that the sentencing judge's ""starting point"" was imprisonment for six years six months but ""it should have been at least eleven years"" notwithstanding that ""a more appropriate starting point was between twelve and fourteen years"" and that the lowest possible starting point was chosen because the appeal was by the Crown. The court allowed a discount in sentence of fifty per cent on account of the guilty plea and the assistance to law enforcement agencies, albeit that it commented that “this is very generous”.40 The offender’s senior counsel submitted that the evidence does not allow me to find that the offender was “the mastermind of the operation”. The Crown Prosecutor did not submit that the offender was the mastermind of the operation, only that he was the principal towards Mr Huang in relation to the transactions conducted by Mr Huang for the offender. I agree with both the offender’s senior counsel and the Crown Prosecutor.41 The offender’s senior counsel submitted that, although Mr Huang was paid by the offender for what he did for him, the evidence does not allow me to find that the offender benefited from what he did . The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, although there is nothing to show whether the offender benefited from what he did and, if he did, what was the benefit or reward, the inference can be drawn, from the fact that the offender paid Mr Huang for what he did for him, that there must have been some benefit or reward to the offender from doing what he did. I agree with the Crown Prosecutor. I doubt that the offender would have done what he did unless there was a benefit or reward to him from doing so, although the evidence does not allow me to say what was that benefit or reward.42 The offender’s senior counsel submitted that, although Mr Huang had given evidence that the offender had told him that his reason for transferring the money overseas was “to avoid paying tax”, the evidence does not allow me to find that the offender’s purpose in doing what he did was to evade the payment of income tax. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, whatever had been the offender’s specific purpose for transferring the money overseas, the evidence allows me to find that his general purpose was to avoid detection of the monies by “the relevant authorities”. Although I doubt that I need to find what was the offender’s specific purpose for doing what he did, I consider that the evidence allows me to find that the offender did what he did to avoid the reporting conditions of the Financial Transactions Reports Act and thereby to avoid detection of the monies by the Australian Taxation Office.43 The offender’s senior counsel submitted that in light of the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to Mr Huang, the appropriate starting point is imprisonment within the range from twelve to fourteen years with imprisonment for twelve years being the more appropriate sentence. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that, as the offender was the principal in relation to Mr Huang, providing him with the money to be transferred overseas and instructing him as to the method to be used to transfer the money overseas, the starting point for the sentence to be imposed upon the offender should be higher than the starting point of between twelve and fourteen years referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in its judgment in the appeal related to Mr Huang. I agree with the Crown Prosecutor. The appropriate starting point for the sentence to be imposed upon the offender must be higher than twelve to fourteen years.44 What, then, having regard to what I have said about the offence and the offender, is an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for the offence?45 I have determined, taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence, the subjective features related to the offender and to the other factors, to all of which I have referred, that the appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender is imprisonment for sixteen years six months.46 As to apportionment of a sentence of imprisonment for sixteen years six months into a non-parole period and a parole period, the usual apportionment produces a non-parole period within the range sixty to sixty five per cent and a parole period within the range thirty five to forty per cent. I fix a non-parole period of ten years six months and a parole period of six years.47 However, as the offender spent a period of eleven months twenty days in prison between his arrest on 1 March 2005 and his release on bail on 20 February 2006, I reduce the period of sixteen years six months by eleven months twenty days to fifteen years six months ten days with a non-parole period of nine years six months ten days and a parole period of six years.48 Accordingly, Zhen Chi Chen, for the offence of dealing with money of $1,000,000 or more intending it to be an instrument of crime, of which the jury found you to be guilty, you are convicted. I sentence you to imprisonment for fifteen years six months ten days. I fix a non-parole period of nine years six months ten days from 22 October 2007 to 1 May 2017 and a parole period of six years from 2 May 2017 to 1 May 2023. I order that you be subject to supervision by the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service whilst on parole during the parole period.49 Mr Chen, I am required by s 16F of the Crimes Act to explain to you the sentence that I have imposed upon you. The jury found you to be guilty of the offence commonly called money laundering. I agree with the jury’s verdict. I have convicted you of the offence. I have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for fifteen years six months ten days for the offence. I have reduced the starting period of sixteen years six months by the period of eleven months twenty days that you have spent in custody between your arrest and your release on bail to the period of fifteen years six months ten days. I have fixed a non-parole period of nine years six months ten days from 22 October 2007 to 1 May 2017, on which day you will be eligible to be released on parole. On your release from prison on parole you will be subject to the terms of parole for six years. You will be required to be of good behaviour during the period of parole. If you offend within the period of parole you will breach that parole and you will be returned to custody to complete the sentence.

   JUDGMENT 1. Four days before the year 2004 was to begin Ahmad Alameddine then aged eighteen and a half, together with his cousin and another man robbed the manager of the Pizza Hut at Woodville Road, Guildford.  2. In his statement Yuan Jan Foo then aged 24 makes clear how traumatic this event was for him as he was harassed, menaced, threatened, bullied, punched and stabbed by three men. Playing a leading role in this violent criminal conduct was Ahmad Alameddine. In a psychological profile before me John Jacmon a psychiatrist reports Ahmad Alameddine was assaulted by a guard dog and a number of security guards so badly, he was traumatised and indeed continues to be traumatised to this day.  3. Ahmad Alameddine seeks to rely upon the traumatic event he endured in November 2003 to mitigate the sentence he is to receive for being callous enough to inflict an equal traumatic trauma upon Yuan Jan Foo eight weeks later when Ahmad Alameddine with two others robbed him of his mobile phone, $130 and his credit card.  4. Ahmad Alameddine is also to be held accountable for his criminal conduct in his use of and attempted use of the victim’s credit card. He succeeded in withdrawing a total of $1,700 from Foo’s account in three transactions. In a further three transactions he sought unsuccessfully to withdraw $1,300.  5. The court’s task today is to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to find the appropriate sentence for these offences committed by this offender harming the victim that he did harm in this community. That task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the conduct before the court. Before that task can be embarked upon the actual facts of this each must be determined. Certain technical matters including the presence of a standard non-parole period of seven years must be analysed and determined, questions of discount for pleas of guilty, the question of deterrence, what if any impact the young age of this offender at the time of the offence can play in these proceedings will all need to be determined.   Facts6. On the 29 December 2003 Yuan Jan Foo was on duty as the manager of Pizza Hut, Woodville Road, and Guildford. At about 10pm Mr Foo closed the store and secured the premises. He attended to administrative duties and dismissed his staff. After completing his administrative duties, Mr Foo turned off all the lights of the store and set the alarm. About 11.35pm the last of the other employees had left. The account of what then happened is best given by Yuan Foo. This is what he told police the following day: “I was left at the store by myself. I was waiting for the daily reports to print out. The reports finished printing out so I made sure all the lights were out and I set the alarm. I walked to the delivery driver’s door to leave. I had the daily reports tucked under my left arm. I had my mobile phone in my left hand and my keys. I opened the door and shut it behind me. I immediately saw a guy jump out from behind the tree. The guy that jumped out from behind the tree was Arabic in appearance; about 17 - 21years of age, slim build, wearing a white long sleeve jumper, white cotton material gloves. He had a knife in his right hand. It was a black handled knife and the blade was about 20centimetres in length.  ""A second guy jumped out from the corner of the building. He was also Arabic in appearance, about 19years of age, bigger than the first, broad across the shoulders, about 165, 170 in height wearing a white jumper and white cotton material gloves.  ""The third guy who must have been behind the second guy, appeared. He was Arabic in appearance, aged nineteen, medium/average build wearing yellow orange jumper and white cotton material gloves as well.  ""The first guy came up to me, he grabbed me by the back of the shirt. I saw he had the knife in his right hand, ‘Open the door, stay calm and open the door and you’ll be all right’ he said. ‘Open the door, open the door’ I heard the fat guy say. I turned around and put in the pin code for the analogue door, which is the same door I came out of.  ""The guy that had hold of the back of my shirt had the knife to my back. I opened the door and went inside the store first and they pulled the door open behind me. All three of them followed me in. As we walked into the store the skinny guy took my mobile phone off me.  ""The skinny guy then said to me, ‘Let’s go turn off the alarm’. They were pushing me along towards where the code pad was as if they knew where it was. We went to the office where the code pad was and I typed in the code to disarm the alarm but I typed in the wrong code. I typed in the code again and the skinny said to me, ‘Switch it off or I’ll stab you’. I said, ‘It’s disarmed’ and the red light changed to green.  ""The skinny guy then said, ‘Where’s the key to the video?’. I said, ‘They don’t have the key in store anymore’. I then saw the skinny guy and the fat guy try to force the door open to where the video is kept. This is the surveillance that monitors the store. I said, ‘You can’t open it, just break it, open it if you have to’. The skinny guy said, ‘Give me your keys’. I handed him my keys and I saw him fiddle around with the bunch of keys to try to open the door to the video.  ""They pushed me to the ground and said, ‘Open the safe’. We know about the time delay. I typed in the code and it wouldn’t open. I said, ‘It won’t open’. The skinny guy said, ‘We know all about the time lock, there’s twenty minutes’. During this time I heard one of the guys say words to the effect of, ‘We know about the time lock because we did the last robbery’.  ""The skinny guy said, ‘Do it again’. I said, ‘You can’t open it, they have changed it since last time’. The skinny guy said, ‘I don’t believe you, you’re lying’. I said, ‘It’s true’. He said, ‘If you don’t open it, I will stab you’. He continued to ask me to type in the code. The skinny guy said, ‘How much money is in there?’. I said, ‘It’s written on the yellow envelope’. I had left the yellow envelope on the top of the safe and it had the amount of money that I’d put in the safe written on it.  ""I was sitting on the ground facing the safe at this stage and the skinny guy was standing near me. The skinny guy started poking me in the leg with his left index finger as if he were trying to find an appropriate spot to stab me. He was leaning over me when he was doing this, then he stabbed the left arm above my elbow. As he did this I flinched and bent my arm up into myself to protect myself. I saw blood on my arm.  ""I said, ‘It’s not much money, it’s not worth dying for, don’t hurt me, don’t hurt me’. I heard the fat guy say, ‘Stay calm, stay calm’. The skinny guy then asked me, ‘Type the code in again’ so I typed it in again. Again the code didn’t work. The skinny guy asked me what the number was so I told him. I saw him type the number in but with a variation at the end of the number. I could see he was getting frustrated with the code not working and he punched me with a closed fist to the left side of my forehead. He said to me, ‘I’ll stab you in the heart, I will kill you if you don’t open it’.  ""As he said this I could see and feel that he had the knife to the back of my neck. I was starting to get really scared now and I said, ‘Take my key card, take my credit card. There’s a few hundred dollars in my wallet. I then told them the pin number of my key card. They didn’t believe me so I told them again. I said, ‘There’s an EFTPOS machine at the front, take it and test it’. They asked me for the code for the safe again and then my pin number to my key card. They kept asking me over and over again to try and catch me out. The skinny guy and the fatter guy kept asking me, the other guy in the yellow jumper didn’t say anything the whole time.  ""I then saw the skinny guy rip up the phone cords out of the wall. The phone is near the alarm pad. The skinny guy said to me, ‘Lie down, if you report this, I know where you live. I’ve got your address. I will drive by and shoot up your house’. As he was saying this he was tying up my hands behind my back with the phone cord that he had ripped out of the wall.  ""I then heard them talk in Lebanese. I heard them go out the back door and I lay on the floor about two to three minutes to make sure that they had gone. I got up and typed in the panic code and then the alarm started sounding and I was scared that they were going to come back so I lay down on the floor again and put the phone cord around my hands. I was expecting the alarm to be silent not a loud one.  ""I waited a short time and I went back to the back door and shut it. I then went to the phone at the front of the store near the freezer and called my sister and asked her to ring the police. I went into the freezer while I spoke with her. I then rang triple 0 and waited for the police to come. I did not give permission for any person to assault, stab, or threaten me in any way nor did I give any permission for any person to take my mobile phone from me. I gave them my money and my key card and credit card because I was scared they were going to hurt me more than they already did.  ""As a result of the skinny guy punching me I have a lump to the right side of my forehead and I have cut underneath my left bicep from where he stabbed me.”  7. That’s the end of what Mr Foo said. There were also two other stabs, very small stab wounds which I’ll come to later.  8. The “skinny guy” is this offender, Ahmad Alameddine. Foo presented to the medical centre at Merrylands. He had a two centimetre bruises to his left cheek, a two centimetre laceration, that means a cut, to his lower left arm, superficial with no underlying muscular or tendon injury. There were no other physical injuries visible. However Dr Wong who treated him described him as mentally okay but nervous and upset about working at the Pizza Hut alone again.  9. There was also apparently two shallow puncture wounds to the left shoulder posteriorly. Between the event and 13 February 2004 Foo was having frequent flashbacks, his mental health was such that he was unable to return to work. He was cleared to return to work on 13 February 2004.  10. Within minutes of the offence this offender used the key card stolen from Foo at the Westpac ATM in Guildford Road, Guildford withdrawing $500. That transaction occurred at 11.50. A minute later he attempted to withdraw a further $500 from the ATM. That transaction was declined because it exceeded the daily limit. At 11.52 the offender attempted to withdraw $400 from the ATM but it was declined because an incorrect PIN number had been keyed in. A further attempt a minute later to withdraw $400 also failed but the offender succeeded in withdrawing $300 from the ATM a moment later. He then drove to Auburn hospital and it was now 12.04 the following day and he withdrew $900 using Mr Foo’s PIN number.  11. Later that day, that is later on the day following the actual robbery police were making enquiries at the Pizza Hut store. They were approached by the cleaner from the adjoining property who alerted police to missing fence palings dividing the property between the furniture store and Granville South Public School where white gloves were located. Three pairs of gloves were seized, DNA profile was recovered from inside one of the gloves. The same white glove revealed a DNA profile consistent with blood coming from Mr Foo.  Objective Criminality 12. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offence with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact as one might imagine on the overall sentencing outcome.  13. Justice Gleeson, now Chief Justice of the High Court, when Chief Justice of New South Wales encapsulated the essence of the legal wrong done by robbers and the reason why a substantial punishment is required in a case called the Queen v Rause unreported, NSWCCA 8 August 1992, His Honour said,  “ One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk about the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others. Offences of the kind committed by present [offender] are not trivial instances of disrespect of private property, they are serious breaches of the peace. They are direct attacks upon the security of the person and the property which the law exists to protect.  ""It is quite likely, (his Honour continued) that this young man (who he was dealing with), does not understand and he may never understand the seriousness of his anti-social behaviour but the courts understand it. Crimes of this kind especially when committed by an offender with a long criminal history, (not this case) deserve severe punishment.” 14. The principal offence was an offence of serious personal violence towards another human being. Robbery constitutes a crime against the person and a person’s property rights. In this case the initial robbery was aimed at the property of Pizza Hut. But it turned from an interest in the property of Pizza Hut into an interest in the property of the person who was doing no more than working for Pizza Hut.  15. The crime against the person is constituted or made up by putting that person in fear through threat or actual violence, in this case a stabbing and a wounding to such a point that he surrenders his own property against his will to the robber. In this case the offender secured an advantage for his violence, not just by the presentation of the knife but by its use on what would appear to be three discrete occasions. In doing so he demonstrated to his victim his own intention of being ruthless, menacing, using the exposed blade of the knife. It was in those circumstances that the victim volunteered his ownership of and surrendered his property to this offender.  16. The offence had been planned. The three men wore gloves. All appear to have worn long sleeve sweaters. They appear to have known the layout of the premises to the point of knowing there were time locks and how long they were to operate for, that there were videos which had keys and where they were. They had waited until all staff had left and the manager was departing before striking, believing they still had the balance of twenty minutes left before the time lock on the safe was sealed. Their priorities once within the premises also demonstrated planning and forethought.  17. The use of threats particularly by this offender were designed to be effective and produce compliance. I regard poking in the leg by this offender as a menace and threat. Foo understood what it was about seeking a place to stab him. I am satisfied the three sites selected by the offender were chosen to puncture the victim’s skin so as to terrify him, in fairness, without causing serious injury. The most serious of the wounds was to the left arm and it was described as superficial. Likewise the physical blow was administered with a view to overcoming the will of the store manager.  18. Unlike many robberies the time during which the robbers confronted their victim was extensive. I am satisfied the intention of the robbers when they entered was to rob Pizza Hut of its money. It is clear they were frustrated in that attempt. While I am conscious Foo was robbed of his mobile phone, he was otherwise not deprived of his property until he became so terrified that he volunteered, “Take my key card” et cetera. His volunteering is a measure of his terror. It is to be remembered earlier he had said in respect of the day’s taking, “It’s not much money, it’s not worth dying for, don’t hurt me”.  19. What was to be the robbery of a business became an opportunistic robbery of Mr Foo. As earlier remarked the criminality of this offender extended beyond the robbery of Foo to include his use of the key card in the ATM. The nature of that offence is the use of deception to obtain a financial benefit or to attempt to obtain a financial benefit. For the offender the benefit obtained was $1,700. Ripping off money from. and the further attempts to take money out of Mr Foo’s account demonstrate ruthless heartlessness by this offender towards Mr Foo who was a working man. He was no Kerry Packer. This was a criminal fleecing of struggling worker by this offender.  20. One of the offenders in the course of the robbery said we know about the time delay. One of the offenders said we know about the time lock because we did the last robbery. Selection of a prior robbery site and using information gained from prior experience of robbing the same premises, constitutes a serious aggravating feature. While I would be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that this offender was embraced in the term “we” when used by the unidentified offender or offenders, because there were three robbers I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was one of those earlier robbers. He explained his knowledge by claiming to have visited the premises as a customer with others who were customers. While I do not accept that as entirely the full story I cannot, as I say, be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt adversely to him.  Standard Non Parole Period 21. Robbery in company with wounding is regarded by parliament as an offence sufficiently serious to merit a standard non-parole period of seven years for an offence falling within what is called the mid range of seriousness. There are aspects of this offence I have highlighted that aggravated seriousness. Three wound sites, substantial manhandling of and violence towards the victim, some level of planning, an extended period in company with the victim, a potential two victims if one counts the business of pizza hut but as events turned out only one, and the use of the items stolen for further illegal activity. 22. What, however, saves this offence from falling into the mid range of seriousness is the superficial nature of the wounding and the modest proceeds from the actual robbery. In assessing the proceeds of the robbery, I have not counted the $1700 obtained from other criminal activity that constitutes separate charges before me.  23. I am conscious that Judge Quirk of this Court when sentencing Mohammed Alameddine, found four reasons for finding his criminality below the mid range of seriousness. Only two of her criteria apply here. I have found there was some psychological sequelae, although it would appear it was resolved within a six week period. Further this offender possessed the knife, was the leader and administered all wounds and most of the other physical violence. I have inferred Judge Quirk found Mohammed Alameddine’s criminality falling substantially below the mid range. I take that finding from the ultimate sentence imposed upon him. In this case I have put the seriousness of this as significantly but not substantially below the mid point.   Subjective Features   Background family relationships and dynamics24. Ahmad Alameddine was an eighteen and a half year old single man at the time of the robbery. He is now approaching his 23rd birthday. There are seven siblings. Ahmad is the fourth child. The probation and parole reports a close supportive family. I have received a letter from his eldest sister. It is obvious from her reference the probation and parole are correct in their assessment. His eldest brother has been or is presently incarcerated for a serious offence. The nature of the offence is not disclosed but he was in full time custody for five and a half years before reaching a “C” classification and day leave in August of 2007. His mother has been battling thyroid cancer for five and a half years. His father gave up employment to be her carer. The offender’s sister describes them as experiencing financial difficulties. His sister says that in his youth Ahmad was seen within the family as the “cheeky and naughty one” but having “a positive and joyful spirit”. As a teenage his choice of friends is described as “not well thought through” leaving him to be negatively influence.  25. His girlfriend is currently pregnant. My understanding is that there was a prior miscarriage. This relationship may be in some difficulty as a result of tensions caused by the attitude of senior members of one family to the relationship. The fact of a custodial sentence outcome, as must happen in this case is also likely to create tensions in the relationship. The birth of his child and the offender’s separation from that child and the relationship’s tensions will make this offender’s time in custody more arduous for him than it would be absent those considerations.   Education, skills and work experience26.  This offender left school, having completed Year 10. Since leaving school he has been employed in a number of casual unskilled positions. He told the Court he was employed more recently as a stonemason by this brother-in-law and sister, she being the one who had supplied the reference. It has been full time employment for the past two years in marble and granite cutting and polishing.   Health27. On the material before me there is nothing to suggest any physical ailment that would impede this offender’s rehabilitation prospects. Indeed he looks to be a fit, well and health young man.   Mental Health 28. John Jacmon who prepared a psychological assessment report records no personal history on psychological issues other than a history of the traumatic dog and security guard attack referred to earlier. References give a contradictory observations of his moods. A neighbour describes him as “always happy with a big smile on his face”. Another referee who is a project officer with DOCS describes him as “positive, confident ... and [having] a great sense of humour.” His sister Rhonda’s description of him as a youth has already been referred to. Of more recent times she writes, “Ahmad has experience traumatic migraines, he suffers insomnia and has been treated for anxiety.”  29. Mr Jacmon’s expert opinion is that Mr Alameddine’s description of daily functioning led to identification of the following symptoms. Thereafter are listed eighteen symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and eight symptoms of major depressive disorder. There is absolutely nothing in the history recounted by Mr Jacmon that could justify a finding of twenty-six symptoms in the thirty-three lines he has devoted to this topic. The psychological profile tests were conducted by Mr Jacmon in September of 2007. That is nearly four years after the robbery. Changes in psychological profiles between a male aged eighteen and the same male aged twenty-two can vary from minimal to profound. Extrapolating from a psychological profile four years after an event of interest the psychological profile at the time of the event is necessarily subjective and speculative. The lines of argument, logic, scientific knowledge to reach the earlier profile should be exposed in the report so that others may understand why they should or perhaps why they cannot accept the expert opinion of an earlier profile. Regrettably none of that has been done in this case. So far as that aspect has been concerned, the family has simply wasted its money.  30. Nor have causal links between the criminal behaviour and any aspect of the psychological profile been explained. To assert, “the testing and clinical interview have gathered considerable information on the offender’s state of mind currently and at the time of the incident” is not to make it so, nor does it make it obvious. There was no attempt to compartmentalise the earlier psychological profile, nor the latter profile, nor as have I just said is there any explanation of which test or which part of the history supports any particular finding made. Simply to state post traumatic stress disorder is likely to have existed at the time of the incident now before the court, bearing in mind the incident was only eight weeks after the dog attack without pointing to symptoms present at the time is inadequate for purposes of proof. In any event, symptoms must persist for a period longer than eight weeks before post traumatic stress becomes a diagnosis of disorder. Even if the symptoms of post traumatic stress existed at the time of the criminal conduct which has not been proved on the balance of probabilities, no nexus between those symptoms and the actual conduct undertaken has been proved on the balance of probabilities.  31. Further, I reject the diagnosis of major depressive disorder, either at the time of the offence or currently. There is no personal history recorded that supports the eight symptoms said to be disclosed by the testing. Nor as I read the results overall would the diagnosis dysphoria, that is a mood, rise to reach any “major depressive status”. His anxiety may have an obvious explanation. This court proceeding and the degree and uncertainty about the outcome where the real prospect of unpleasant life altering consequences arising from incarceration.  32. There is nothing in the mental health that suggests any pathology likely to interfere with this offender’s prospects of rehabilitation or his capacity to lead a full active and well adjusted life in the future.   Alcohol and drugs 33. The accused reports to probation and parole and indeed to Mr Jacmon that he does not consume alcohol or drugs. If this is so, it is difficult to understand his risk taking behaviour, in taking as he claims to have done, a single ecstasy tablet one hour before this robbery. I shall return to that topic later.  34. The offending conduct on his case is not motivated to any desire for money to fund drug or alcohol consumption. Indeed motivation remains entirely unexplained. On his case, drug and alcohol issues will not impede his prospects for rehabilitation.   Character and criminal history35. Ahmad Alameddine is a twenty-two year old man with strong family ties. He appears to have support and a favourable character assessment by members of his family and other community members. He has shown a community spirit in mowing the lawns of a seventy-eight year told woman known to him. His criminal antecedents reflect a disregard for motor traffic laws and regulations. Such attitude is antisocial. Likewise he has shown a disregard for orders of the Local Court by driving when he has been disqualified by that court. That disregard for orders of the court is further illustrated by his failure to comply with the court’s order to accept supervision by probation and parole.  36. On the other hand, his sister speaks of a maturing by him in recent times. For the past two years he has been working for her husband and helps the family out financially. I note, however, the driving offences I have referred to have occurred since this offending conduct. Putting to one side the driving offences, his other criminal convictions are few and for minor matters.   Attitude to offence 37. No motive has been given for this offending conduct. The offender has sought rely up on the impact upon him of a single ecstasy tablet taken one hour before this offence. He told probation and parole he was so shocked by his offending actions that he has not used anything since. He told Mr Jacmon he had met a friend who seemed particularly happy, who slipped a single tablet into his hand as they shook hands, saying trust me, take the tablet. The offender claims to have “trusted” his friend and taken the tablet. Why so, as I say is difficult to understand. He is not a drug taker. The tablet turned out to be ecstasy.  38. So far as taking the tablet is concerned, I note his psychological profile assesses his character as “tough minded and sceptical”. It would seem contrary to his character to have taken the tablet. Thereafter the incident followed in which the offender took the leading role. I note his psychological profile which Mr Jacmon seeks to base his conclusions upon, says this offender’s test results indicate a person who may be modest, retiring, and lacking skill in asserting himself, a very meek and unassertive person. That certainly was not the person who committed this robbery. The offender told Mr Jacmon he does not have clear memories of his action and waking up the following morning realising what he had done and feeling remorseful over the event. It is to be remembered, having left the pizza shop the offender was at Guildford Westpac ATM and Auburn Hospital ATM using the victim’s card on six occasions. It is a well known fact that drugs alter the personalities of individuals in different ways. Sometimes for good. For example, antidepressants; and sometimes in unexpected and detrimental ways. There is a whole body of science relating to the impact drugs may have upon those who consume them. The science of pharmacology. The onus of proving one single ecstasy tablet turned this apparently very meek, unassertive person into the forceful, tough- minded and determined criminal who conducted the robbery rests with the defence.  39. Mr Jacmon included in his report a paragraph obtained from the National Institute of Drug Abuse study giving an overview of chronic use of ecstasy. If one understands chronic to mean “long term” usually more than a year of use, these findings have absolutely no relevance to this case. This offender claims one single tablet is responsible for his behaviour. It is highly unlikely any respectable pharmacologist could, using his knowledge, skill and experience in pharmacology, validate this offender’s claim. However, that is not a matter I need to speculate upon. It is enough to note there is absolutely not one drop of scientific evidence in this case supporting his claim of personality change caused by ecstasy reacting upon his metabolism. The onus of proper proof rests with the defence. I note it was not even attempted.  40. I reject any claimed impact or adverse reaction of ecstasy upon the metabolism or psyche of the offender as playing any part in the commission of this offence. I regard his reliance upon the claim as an attempt to minimise his offending conduct. Why he seeks to minimise his criminality is unclear. It does not appear he has confided in any of the family prior to his arrest. I say that because of the family’s expressed resentment to having police, who from the family’s point of view, seeking to put one of the family members on the spot for this offence.  41. Since his arrest he has disclosed his claimed remorse. He has told Mr Jacmon he was remorseful immediately after. Yet he did nothing to ameliorate his own family’s anxiety about the police investigation. Thus there were limits to what his sense of remorse and contrition would permit him to do.  42. It is not clear whether he has disclosed his offending conduct to immediate family. His eldest sister makes no reference to any disclosure. Indeed her claim is that because of family financial difficulties he was advised to plead guilty, suggesting serious consideration by the family to funding a trial. While I am satisfied the guilty plea has been properly entered, there is a sense the offender may be maintaining a claim innocence in family circles. If that was so, it would be difficult to reconcile that conduct with genuine contrition.   Plea status 43. The plea of guilty was entered on 10 May 2006 on arraignment. There has been substantial delay between arraignment and sentencing hearing. There was a trial of the cousin that commenced on 6 August 2007. His sentence was finalised in December of 2007. I understand that there was some attempt to have this sentence placed before her Honour Judge Quirk, as events turned out, unsuccessfully.  44. While there has been a delay, it does not appear to impact upon the utilitarian value of the plea. There has been no suggestion the plea has not been maintained, nor has there been any dispute on the plea as to the available facts. In New South Wales the utilitarian value of the plea is recognised as meriting a mitigation of penalty. The case is established that where the utilitarian value of the plea are at their greatest, a discount in the order of 25% is appropriate. Even for a late entered plea a discount of 10% or perhaps more can be appropriate. This plea was entered on arraignment, that is at a very early stage of the District Court process. I will allow a discount of 20% for this plea to the sentence I would have otherwise set. The Offender’s Youth 45. A significant factor in setting the sentence revolves around recognition of the offender’s youth at the time of offending. The starting point is to recognise that full time custody should be a sentence of last resort. Sometimes that policy can be given effect by determining a sentencing disposition other than full-time custody. Regrettably, given the seriousness and the adult nature of this offender’s criminality, that is not an available outcome in this case. Sometimes though that policy can be given effect by selecting a lower rather than a greater period in full-time custody. Such an outcome can be achieved by finding special circumstances, provided such a finding is permissible.  46. The cases establish that in appropriate cases, youth of an offender, being one such group of cases, a greater emphasis can be given to rehabilitation purposes of sentencing rather than punitive purposes particularly in setting the non-parole period. This appears to me to be such a case because:  * Age of offender at the time of offending, eighteen and a half; * No suggestion that further offending since December of 2003; * The offender is developing masonry skills and can develop them better in the community than in custody;  * Offender is demonstrating a strong work ethic, an important rehabilitating factor;  * The offender has strong family support; and * Drug and alcohol do not appear a major aspect of this offender’s profile.  47. The further advantages of finding special circumstances are, the court can acknowledge the seriousness of the criminality in a total sense, yet give to the youth a real opportunity to rehabilitate with the strong personal deterrence of parole conditions hanging over his head. In the circumstances of this case parole will not be automatic. For this offender to obtain parole on the due date, he will be required to impress the parole authorities with his rehabilitation progress whilst in custody.  48. The youth of the offender is of relevance to determination between the relationship of the non-parole period and the head sentence. In this case a greater range of proportion between the total term of imprisonment and the non-parole period is permitted, provided the non-parole period still bears in mind the overall criminality of the offender, see Hearne (2007) 124 A. Crim. R 457. Standard non-parole period 49. There are two reasons why the standard non-parole period of seven years does not apply in this case. Firstly, the plea of guilty takes this case outside those cases attracting a standard non-parole period, R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. Secondly, when reviewing the objective criminality I have found the offence on its objective circumstances fell below the mid range of seriousness. Nonetheless the seven year non-parole period is to be taken as an indicator that even where the case falls outside the standard non-parole period there will be a leavening upwards of the sentence by reason of the fact that the legislature has indicated all s 98 offences are to be subject to tougher sentencing regime than was previously the case. This must necessarily be harsher than it would have been prior to the introduction of standard non-parole periods.   Delay50. There has been a delay approaching four and a half years between the commission of this offence and the sentencing by a court for it. For a young man aged eighteen at the time of the offence and twenty-two now, delay of four and a half years constitutes a significant portion of his adult life. During those years there have been changes involving some maturation, employment and emotional development. The offender is shortly to be a father. His right to silence shields him from any responsibility to report his criminality. Delay in the investigation of the offence cannot be put at his doorstep. I intend to make some allowance for delay in setting the non-parole period. As delay can be measured, this delay is not great. In the normal course of events it can take up to two years or so after the commission of an offence to finalise the matter in this court. Most matters are finalised well within that timeframe. Indeed we try to finalise matters within the year. In this case I sense there may have been difficulties in the investigation and further difficulties finalising after arraignment.  51. I have made a very modest allowance to the sentencing outcome based upon a delay of about eighteen months. Again that has been to the non-parole period rather than the total sentence.   Custodial history 52. This Offender has spent no time in custody for this offence. He was arrested on 18 January 2006. His bail conditions have required him to report daily to police since 18 January 2006. Those conditions are arduous. Mostly, when bail conditions are required, there is either weekly or bi-weekly reporting. Again some allowance has been made for that arduousness in the sentencing outcome.  Parity53. Co-offender Mohammed Alameddine was sentenced by Judge Quirk after trial to a non-parole period of two years and an additional term of two years. There seems little dispute that offender was found by her Honour to have played the least aggressive role in the robbery. He was there for numbers only. The victim described him as being, “in the background”. He played no part in any of the woundings or the physical assaults but may have manhandled the victim by pushing or bustling him to various locations.  54. The Crown argues and the defence concedes this offender must receive a greater sentence. That must be so for the robbery. Then of course there are six other offences for which he must be punished. While they occurred subsequently to the robbery I shall be dealing with them by way of fixed terms.  55. The robbery in company with wounding carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. So stated it must be recognised this offence falls on the second tier of offences of seriousness. The first tier of sentences have a maximum of life imprisonment. So stated it can be seen that parliament reviews robbery in company with wounding as a highly serious offence. The obtain and attempt to obtain benefit by deception has a maximum penalty of five years. The attempt will be regarded as less serious because no harm was done to the victim. There was less criminality than in the case where $1700 in total were taken.   Totality - partly cumulative, party concurrent sentences56. There is a substantial difference between the criminality of the offender at the Pizza Hut and his criminality at the two ATMs. I regard all ATM offences as amalgamated into one escapade of criminality. Thus I am dealing with seven offences but two episodes of criminality. I intend to reflect the existence of the two episodes by partly accumulating the sentence for the robbery to the terms of imprisonment imposed on the ATM offences. Totality also requires some adjustment downward on the robbery in company sentence so that that sentence reflects the total criminality involved.   Setting the sentences 57. In setting the sentences I have had borne in mind, as I say, the maximum penalty and their deterrent purposes. The sentence I would have set for the successful ATM offences of deception would have been twelve months for the three offences where money was obtained and six months for the offences where money was not obtained. Discounted by 20% and rounded out, they become sentences of ten months and five months respectively. The sentence I would have set for the robbery in company with wounding would have been a sentence of seven years. That will be reduced by seventeen months to a sentence of five years and nine months.  58. Ahmad Alameddine, for the offence that you on 29 December at Guildford in the state of New South Wales by deception did dishonestly obtain for yourself a sum of money, you are sentenced to ten months, a fixed term to date from 27 March 2008 and to expire on 26 January 2009. Likewise, for the other two offences of obtaining for yourself the sum of money the following day, you are equally sentenced to terms of imprisonment of ten months to commence on the same date and to expire on the same date.  59. For the offence that you on 29 December 2003 at Guildford did attempt to obtain by deception dishonestly for yourself a sum of money, for each of those three offences you are sentenced to a fixed term of five months to date from 27 March 2008 and to expire on 26 August 2008. You are convicted of those offences.  60. For the offences that you on 29 December at Guildford being in company with Mohammed Alameddine and a person unknown robbed Yuan Jan Foo of a National Australia Bank key bard, a National Australia Bank visa card and a sum of money, all the property of Mr Foo and at the time you wounded Mr Yuan Foo, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and three months to date from 28 September 2008 and to expire on 27 December 2010. You are sentenced to a balance of term of three years and six months to expire on 27 June 2014.  61. So that you can understand what I have done, I have given you an effective non-parole period of two years and nine months to date from today. That two years and nine months will mean that you will be in custody until 27 December 2010. On that date, provided your progress is sufficient for the parole board, you will eligible to be released. As I said your release is not automatic. It is something you will need to work for. Is there any other order I need to make?   0o0o0

    The respondent was charged with five offences of supply prohibited drug contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and a sixth charge of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis contrary to the provisions of s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The offences arose in circumstances where the respondent supplied Ecstasy tablets to undercover police officers. The conduct in which the undercover police officers engaged in to obtain the drugs was authorised under an authority to conduct a controlled operation, granted pursuant to s 6 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997.In the course of the committal proceedings, the respondent issued to the Commissioner of Police a subpoena for production, requiring the production of, inter alia, documents that were completed by Police in accordance with the Controlled Operations Act and Regulations, including but not limited to the applications made for the approval of the Controlled Operation. The Commissioner of Police sought an order that this part of the subpoena be set aside as an abuse of process, on the ground that there was no legitimate forensic purpose in seeking access to those documents. The respondent (bearing the onus) submitted that the legitimate forensic purpose for production was that the documents contained information that would assist the defence insofar as they would go towards challenging the admissibility of the evidence pursuant to s 138(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995, ‘Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence’. The respondent suggested that there was some impropriety or contravention of a law in the issuing of the Authorities, which as of consequence, resulted in the charges being laid against the respondent. The Magistrate rejected that there was a legitimate forensic purpose in the terms identified by the respondent, but determined that there was another legitimate forensic purpose in allowing the respondent to “check that there has been compliance with form” in the issuing of the Controlled Operations Authorities. Although not an original party of the proceedings, the Attorney General for New South Wales appealed against this finding, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.Held per Beazley JA (James and Kirby JJ agreeing):1. The Attorney General has a right of appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order, pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

    2. The test for determining whether a party is required to produce documents pursuant to a subpoena is a two-step process. Before access is granted, the applicant must (i) identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought; and (ii) establish that it is ‘on the cards’ that the documents will materially assist his or her case.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: This is an appeal from an interlocutory order of a Magistrate refusing to set aside part of a subpoena directed to the Commissioner of Police during the course of committal proceedings. The appeal is brought by the Attorney General for New South Wales (the Attorney General) pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Two discrete issues are raised on the appeal. The first is whether the Attorney General has standing to bring the appeal. The second is whether the Magistrate erred in determining that there was a legitimate forensic purpose in subpoenaing the documents in question. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    2 The respondent has been charged with five offences of supply prohibited drug contrary to the provisions of s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and a sixth charge of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis contrary to the provisions of s 25A(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The charge under s 25A(1) is a more serious offence than the charges under s 25(1). The maximum penalty under s 25(1) is a fine of 2000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 15 years, or both, and the maximum penalty provided for by s 25A is 3500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both.  
     
      
    3 The allegation in respect of the s 25A offence is that the respondent on three or more separate occasions, during a period of 30 consecutive days, supplied a prohibited drug for financial reward. The occasions relied upon in support of this charge are the occasions which form the basis of the specific charges under s 25(1). The offences arose in circumstances where the respondent supplied the drugs to undercover police officers. On each occasion, the supply was of a small quantity of Ecstasy tablets. (On four of the five occasions, one Ecstasy tablet was sold. On the other occasion, two tablets were sold.) The conduct in which the undercover police officers engaged to obtain the Ecstasy tablets was authorised under an authority to conduct a controlled operation, granted pursuant to s 6 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997. 
     
      
    4 On 24 May 2006, in the course of the committal proceedings, the respondent caused to be issued to the Commissioner of Police a subpoena for production, requiring the production, inter alia, of: 
     
      
       
        
        “3. A copy of the relevant documents and things required to be completed by the Police in accordance with the Controlled Operations Act and Regulations, including but not limited to the applications made for the approval of the Controlled Operation CO 05/434.”  
        
       
      
    5 By application filed 26 June 2006, the Commissioner of Police sought an order, inter alia, from the Court, pursuant to cl 47 of the Local Courts (Criminal and Applications) Procedure Rule 2003 and s 227 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 that para 3 of the schedule to the subpoena be set aside as an abuse of process on the ground that there was no legitimate forensic purpose in seeking access to those documents. The respondent bore the onus of establishing that he had a legitimate forensic purpose for production: see Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v Tastan (1994) 75 A Crim R 498 at 504; R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18; Commissioner of Police v Tuxford [2002] NSWCA 139 at [22]. 
     
      
    6 The legitimate forensic purpose for which the respondent sought the production of the documents was articulated in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the documents contain information that will assist the accused’s defence insofar as they go towards challenging the admissibility of evidence pursuant to s.138(1)(b) of the  
        Evidence Act 1995 
        .”  
        
       
      
    7 Section 138(1)(b) of the Evidence Act 1995 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        138 Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
         
         
        (1) Evidence that was obtained:  
         
         
         … 
         
         
          
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
          
         
         
          
          is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    8 In aid of his case that there was a legitimate forensic purpose, the respondent said that it was “on the cards”: see Alister v R [1983] HCA 45; (1984) 154 CLR 404, that the documents referred to in para 3 of the subpoena would support an argument that the Controlled Operation Authorities issued in this case and pursuant to which the controlled operations were carried out, “were themselves applied for or granted pursuant to some impropriety”. If that was established, an application under s 138 of the Evidence Act for the exclusion of the evidence of the undercover police officers would be made at trial. 
     
      
    9 There was no challenge to the validity of the Controlled Operation Authorities. Rather, the argument advanced by the respondent before the Magistrate was, as I have indicated, that there was some impropriety or contravention of a law in the issuing of the Authorities and that in consequence of that impropriety or contravention, the evidence was obtained which resulted in the charges being laid against the respondent.  
     
      
    10 The ‘impropriety’ was more specifically identified by senior counsel for the respondent during the course of appeal. He explained that the respondent’s defence to the charge under s 25A was that the repetitive conduct in which the respondent had engaged and upon which that offence was based was “an artefact of the design of the controlled operation”. It was alleged that the repetition of supply was deliberately sought by the police in order to create, or “ramp up”, the charges from isolated incidents to a course of dealing in contravention of s 25A. In other words, it was asserted that the s 25A charge had only come about by the undercover police operatives importuning the respondent to supply the drug on a number of occasions. It was said that the police could only have engaged in that conduct by specifically making an application to do so. Of necessity, the conduct in which they proposed to engage had to be “mapped out” in the plan of the proposed operation, required to be provided in support of an application for a Controlled Operations Authority under s 5(2A) the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act.  
     
      
    11 It was submitted that to have a deliberate ploy to induce the respondent to engage in repetitive conduct in which he would not otherwise engage (or at least in respect of which the police may not be able to prove repetitive conduct for the purposes of s 25A) was an abuse of power contrary to the purpose for which the powers under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act have been conferred and was a sufficient impropriety to ground an objection to the admissibility of the evidence of the police officers under s 138.  
     
      
    12 The Magistrate rejected that there was a legitimate forensic purpose in the terms identified by the respondent. However, he determined that there was another legitimate forensic purpose which he identified in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is appropriate that the defence be allowed access to the documents [required under s 5(2A) of the  
        Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 
        ]  
        so that they can check that there has been compliance with form 
         in order for the Chief Executive Officer to be … satisfied that [a controlled operations authority should be granted]. (Emphasis added) 
         
         
        … there is a legitimate forensic purpose for the supply of the material [referred to in s 5(2A) of the  
        Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 
        ] to the defence and that being the case it is on the cards that there could be mounted, if there is non-compliance with [s 5(2A)] at an appropriate time an argument under s 138 of the [Evidence] Act.” 
        
       
      
    13 The Magistrate therefore refused the Commissioner of Police’s application to strike out para 3 of the schedule to the subpoena.  
     
      
    14 The Attorney General has appealed as of right from that decision pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    15 Both parties agree that for an appeal to this Court under s 5F to succeed, the appellant must establish error of the type identified in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499: see R v Taylor [2007] NSWCCA 104; 169 A Crim R 543; Jovanovski v R [2008] NSWCCA 9 at [20].  
     
      
       
      Issues on the appeal 
       
      
    16 In the first instance, the respondent challenges the competency of the appeal brought by the Attorney General as of right under s 5F(2). The respondent contends that the right of appeal conferred by s 5F(2) is not an unqualified right of appeal, but may only be availed of when the Attorney General has some relevant interest in the proceedings. In this case, the Attorney General was neither a party to the proceedings in the Court below, nor the recipient of the subpoena, nor the moving party in seeking to set it aside. No question of public interest immunity was involved. It was submitted, therefore, that the Attorney General has no right of appeal in this case under s 5F(2).  
     
      
    17 Insofar as the appeal proper is concerned, the Attorney General makes an overarching complaint that para 3 of the schedule to the subpoena was too wide, as it would require the production of documents including the report to the Chief Executive Officer under s 15 and the report to the Ombudsman under s 21 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act. However, his essential challenge to para 3 was that the respondent had failed to establish that there was a legitimate forensic purpose of the type which permits access to the documents.  
     
      
       
      Appeal under s 5F of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
        
       
      
    18 Section 5F provides for an appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order in, relevantly, the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to:  
         
         
          
          (a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, and 
          
         
         
        … 
         
         
        (2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies. 
         
         
        (3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:  
         
         
          
          (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal. 
          
         
         
        (3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. 
         
         
        (4) An appeal under this section shall, unless the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to adduce fresh, additional or substituted evidence, be determined on the evidence (if any) given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates. 
         
         
        (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal:  
         
         
          
          (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19 Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act was inserted by the Criminal Appeal (Amendment) Act 1987 and commenced on 18 December 1987.  
     
      
    20 The conferring of a statutory right of appeal upon the Attorney General is not new. Such a right was first conferred in 1924 by the insertion of s 5C to the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by the Crimes (Amendment) Act 1924, s 33. The section in its earliest form read:  
     
      
       
        
        “5C Where the Supreme Court or a Court of Quarter Sessions has quashed any information or indictment or any count thereof the Attorney-General may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the order made, and such court may thereupon determine the appeal and if the appeal is sustained may make such order for the prosecution of the trial as may be necessary.” 
        
       
      
    21 Section 5C has undergone various amendments, but in each amendment, the Attorney General’s right of appeal has been maintained. In the amendments made by the Criminal Appeal (Amendment) Act 1986 Sch 1(3), (commencing on 13 July 1987) (the 1986 amendment), a right of appeal was also conferred upon the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP). This aspect of the amendment historically reflects the creation of the office of the DPP by the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1986. The 1986 amendment Sch 1(2) also extended the right of appeal to an appeal from the stay of an information or indictment (commencing on 1 February 1987). The right of appeal from a stay was removed from s 5C with the introduction of s 5F, which conferred the broader right of appeal against interlocutory judgments or orders: see the Criminal Appeal (Amendment) Act 1987, Sch 1(1) and 1(2) respectively (the 1987 amendment). An appeal from a stay of an information or indictment, being an interlocutory order, would now fall within s 5F. Section 5C has been further amended, but not so as to affect the right of appeal conferred upon the Attorney General and the DPP. Also, consistently with the insertion of a right of appeal of the DPP in s 5C, the 1987 amendments conferred a right of appeal on the DPP against interlocutory decisions in s 5F.  
     
      
    22 That it was the intention of the legislature to confer a right of appeal on the Attorney General and the DPP is apparent both from the Second Reading Speech and the Explanatory Note in respect of interlocutory orders (including an appeal from a stay). In his Second Reading Speech the Minister, the Hon Mr Sheahan, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions will be able to appeal as of right against such orders. This is the present position where orders are made quashing or staying an indictment in the District Court or Supreme Court.” (New South Wales Legislative Assembly,  
        Parliamentary Debates 
         (Hansard), 17 November 1987, at 16088 (the Hon Mr Sheahan, Attorney General and Minister Assisting the Premier)) 
        
       
      
    23 The Explanatory Note to the Criminal Appeal (Amendment) Bill is to the same effect. It states:  
     
      
       
        
        “Schedule 1 (2) provides for an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order … The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions would be able to appeal as of right (this is the present position on a stay of proceedings). Any other appeal would be by leave of the Court of Criminal Appeal …” 
        
       
      
    24 Whilst accepting that s 5F(2) confers a right of appeal (relevantly, in this case, upon the Attorney General), the respondent contended that the Attorney General must establish some interest in the proceedings in order to be entitled to exercise the right of appeal conferred by the subsection. In support of this argument, the respondent submitted that there was a basic principle of law that an Attorney General does not have “a roving commission to initiate litigation to disrupt settled outcomes in earlier cases”: see Re McBain;  Ex parte Australian Catholic Bishops Conference [2002] HCA 16; 209 CLR 372 at [76] per Gaudron and Gummow JJ. It was submitted that if the Attorney General had an appeal as of right under s 5F(2), that “usual principle” would be displaced. It was said that it was not apparent on the terms of s 5F(2) that Parliament intended this result and that it was contrary to the usual principles of statutory construction that clear words are necessary to displace existing rights.  
     
      
    25 The respondent referred the Court to the decision of Regina v Cheng [1999] NSWCCA 373; (1999) 48 NSWLR 616. In that case, Spigelman CJ (Dunford and Kirby JJ agreeing) stated at [32] that s 5F should be construed by application of the well-known presumption that Parliament did not, in any statutory enactment, “intend to modify fundamental principles or common law rights”, unless it did so in “clear and unambiguous language”.  
     
      
    26 The respondent’s submission recognised that there were circumstances where the Attorney General may involve himself in proceedings to which he is not a party, but only if a Constitutional issue or a question concerning a charitable trust was raised. It was also conceded that if there was some other statutory provision entitling the Attorney General to intervene, or if there was the enforcement of public rights or the right of the Crown in issue, then he or she would have such right. 
     
      
    27 It is not necessary to review the extent of the Attorney General’s function and role as discussed in Re McBain. It can be accepted that the Attorney General does not have a roving commission to intervene in criminal proceedings. Having accepted that, it is necessary to turn to the terms of the statutory provision. The “primary object of statutory construction” is to construe a provision of an Act so that “it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute”: see Project Blue Sky v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28 at [69]; 194 CLR 355; Bropho v Western Australia [1990] HCA 24; (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 20; Kingston v Keprose Pty Ltd (1987) 11 NSWLR 404 at 423; Palgo Holdings Pty Ltd v Gowans [2005] HCA 28; (2005) 221 CLR 249; and the Interpretation Act 1987, s 33.  
     
      
    28 The search for the proper purpose of a provision commences with its ordinary meaning. It is only if the grammatical meaning does not give effect to the purpose of the legislation that such a meaning cannot prevail: Kingston v Keprose per McHugh JA at 423; Bropho v Western Australia at [20]; and Palgo Holdings v Gowans per Kirby J at [35]. 
     
      
    29 Section 5F(2), by its express terms, confers upon both the Attorney General and the DPP a right of appeal against an interlocutory order made in committal or criminal proceedings. The terms of the provision are plain and unambiguous. The terms of s 5F(3) support this construction. The right of appeal conferred upon the DPP and the Attorney General by s 5F(2) is to be contrasted with the right conferred by s 5F(3) which requires “any other party to proceedings to which this section applies” to obtain leave to appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order. The DPP may initiate committal proceedings pursuant to s 8(1) of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act and in this case did so and was the other party to the proceedings. The combined effect of s 5F(2) and s 5F(3) is therefore clear. The Attorney General has a right of appeal. The DPP has a right of appeal. “Any other party” may appeal with leave.  
     
      
    30 The conferral of the right of appeal on the Attorney General is consistent with and may be seen as an extension of the statutory right of appeal that has existed since 1924. Both the Second Reading Speech and the Explanatory Note make this plain that it was the intention of the legislature to do so. Contrary to the respondent’s argument that the effect of the section would be to confer a “roving commission” on the Attorney General to intervene in proceedings, the right conferred is specific: it is a right to appeal against orders quashing indictments: s 5C; and a right to appeal against interlocutory orders: s 5F.  
     
      
    31 There are other provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act where a right of appeal is directly conferred upon the Attorney General and the DPP. Section 5D provides that the Attorney General or the DPP may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence to which the Crown is a party. Section 5DA confers a right of appeal upon the Attorney General or the DPP against a sentence that was reduced because of an undertaking to provide assistance when the assistance has not been provided. Section 5DB confers a right of appeal upon the Attorney General of the DPP against any sentence imposed by the Supreme Court or District Court on the conviction of a person for a related summary offence in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Div 7 of Pt 3 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act. 
     
      
    32 Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that these provisions were not of assistance on the question of statutory construction, as the legislation has been amended so frequently, that it could not be said that there was a cohesive scheme under the Criminal Appeal Act whereby a right of appeal was conferred upon the Attorney General, notwithstanding that the Attorney General was not a party to the proceedings. Rather, it was contended that the Act’s provisions ought to be read individually, without reference to other provisions of the Act. Such an approach is, of course, contrary to the usual approach to statutory interpretation that a provision is to be construed in the context of an Act as a whole and that similar language or concepts used in different sections of an Act, should, unless some contrary intention was apparent, be given the same construction. But in any event, the language in these sections reinforces the construction I have given to the subsection. Not only does s 5F(2) state in plain and unambiguous terms that the Attorney General (and the DPP) has a right of appeal, it is apparent from the provisions to which I have just referred that the legislature has seen fit, in a variety of circumstances relating to criminal proceedings, to confer upon the Attorney General (and the DPP) a right of appeal. There is no circumstance, in my opinion, to give the section the limited operation for which the respondent contends. 
     
      
    33 In addition to the matters to which I have referred above, each of which is sufficient to counter the respondent’s argument, the Attorney General’s right of appeal under s 5F(2) has been endorsed in a number of decisions in this Court. The respondent contends that in those cases the right of appeal has been assumed and was not a matter in issue. The respondent submitted that in the cases where it had been accepted that there was a right of appeal, the Attorney General had a relevant interest, for example, where the Attorney General had intervened to raise a question of a public interest immunity, as was the position in Attorney General for New South Wales v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667.  
     
      
    34 In Attorney General for New South Wales v Stuart, a party to committal proceedings had caused a subpoena to be issued to the Commissioner of Police. In response to that subpoena, the Attorney General made a claim of public interest immunity. There was a challenge to jurisdiction on the basis that the Magistrate’s ruling on the public interest immunity issue did not amount to an interlocutory decision for the purposes of s 5F. In this Court, Hunt CJ at CL (Smart and Studdert JJ agreeing), accepted that the Attorney General had an appeal as of right under s 5F(2). The respondent pointed out that the Attorney General in that case had been an active participant in the proceedings before the Magistrate in which the determination was made, so that it could not be said that he was an inter-meddler in the proceedings, as the respondent asserts is the case here. It was submitted, therefore, that this case did not advance the Attorney General’s argument. 
     
      
    35 However, in Director of Public Prosecutions v Smith (1996) 86 A Crim R 308, the Attorney General had no specific interest in the proceedings. In that case, an application was made to a Magistrate in the course of committal proceedings for an order that two persons who were police informers and who had been named in the course of committal proceedings, should have their identities protected by the use of pseudonyms. An order was also sought restraining the publication of evidence that would identify them. The Magistrate refused the application. The Attorney General brought an appeal, both in the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Court of Appeal. (The proceedings in the Court of Appeal are not presently relevant.)  
     
      
    36 In the Court of Criminal Appeal proceedings, this Court (Gleeson CJ, Clarke and Sheller JJA) stated, at 309: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal is brought by the Attorney General,  
        as of right 
        , under s 5 
        F 
         of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 (NSW).” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      Later, at 311, the Court held that the decision of the Magistrate to refuse the application concerning the use of pseudonyms and the suppression of the evidence was an interlocutory judgment or order that fell within the meaning of s 5F. The Court then observed that the police informers who had applied for the orders were not parties to the committal proceedings, but stated that the Attorney General and the DPP both had a right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5F(2). Whilst it does not appear from the reported decision that the standing of the Attorney General under s 5F(2) to bring the proceedings as of right was under challenge, it is apparent from the Court’s comment to which I have just referred that the question of standing to bring the appeal was a matter to which the Court turned its attention. Accordingly,  
      Smith’s 
       case, at least, supports the Attorney General’s construction that s 5F(2) confers an unqualified right of appeal and  
      Stuart  
      is not inconsistent with that proposition.  
       
      
    37 In order to give effect to the respondent’s argument that the Attorney General or DPP must have some interest before it can appeal as of right under s 5F(2), words would need to be implied into the subsection. The effect of such an implication would be to require the Attorney General or the DPP to satisfy a precondition, unexpressed in the subsection, before the Court could have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. Words may only be implied into a provision where the statutory purpose would otherwise be defeated: Kingston v Keprose per McHugh JA at 423; Ellavale Engineering Pty Limited v Pilgrim [2005] NSWCA 272; (2005) 2 DDCR 744.  
     
      
    38 The statutory purpose here was clear. It was to provide an unqualified right of appeal. There is nothing in the section or in any of the material to which the Court was referred to indicate that s 5F(2) was directed to some different purpose, such as that asserted by the respondent, namely, that the Attorney General or the DPP only has a right of appeal if either can establish some interest in the proceedings, such as raising a claim of public interest immunity.  
     
      
    39 Accordingly, in my opinion, the Attorney General has a right of appeal and the appeal before this Court is competent. 
     
      
       
      Legitimate forensic purpose 
       
      
    40 There was no dispute between the parties as to the principles to be applied in determining whether there was a legitimate forensic purpose in a party having access to documents. The real dispute in this case was the identification of the legitimate forensic purpose and whether such purpose had been established. As I have already indicated, the Magistrate rejected the legitimate forensic purpose advanced by the respondent but found that a different legitimate forensic purpose had been established. It is from that determination that the appeal is brought.  
     
      
    41 The basis upon which the appeal has been brought has placed the respondent in some difficulty. He submitted that if this Court rejected the legitimate forensic purpose as found by the Magistrate, he would want to reassert the legitimate forensic purpose that he had originally advanced. He could not, of course, cross-appeal, because he had an order in his favour and there is no procedure in the Court of Criminal Appeal for the raising of a point of contention, as exists under the procedures of the Court of Appeal. The respondent sought to deal with this dilemma by submitting that if the Attorney General was successful on the appeal, the Court should nonetheless refrain from setting aside para 3 of the subpoena. In short, his submission was that he should be permitted to advance the original forensic purpose that he had advanced before the Magistrate and if he succeeded in establishing that forensic purpose, the Court should not make any order on the appeal.  
     
      
    42 In indicating this proposed course, the respondent stated that he proposed to expand the legitimate forensic purpose that had been asserted before the Magistrate, so as to allege that the respondent had been induced or entrapped into engaging in the criminal conduct for which he has been charged, in particular, under s 25A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, in contravention of s 7 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act.  
     
      
    43 The respondent also informed the Court that an additional ‘purpose’ had become apparent since the delivery of the Crown brief, which included copies of the Controlled Operation Authorities, and he also wished to rely on that additional legitimate forensic purpose.  
     
      
    44 The respondent identified the additional legitimate forensic purpose in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “The plan of the proposed operation and the statement of the nature of the criminal activities in respect of which the operation is to be conducted and the nature of the criminal activity in respect of which an authority is sought (‘the information’) is relevant to determining whether: 
         
         
        (a) [the respondent] committed an offence 
         
         
        (b) [the respondent] would have committed the offence but for the controlled operation 
         
         
        (c) [the respondent’s] level of offending meets the standard required by s.25A of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act.”  
        
       
      
    45 The respondent’s submission that this Court not make any orders under s 5F(5) (other than to dismiss the appeal) did not commend itself to the Court. For the Court to have entertained this proposed course of action would have involved a consideration of two matters not advanced before the Magistrate. First, the original legitimate forensic purpose was being proposed in different terms and the additional purpose had been formulated having regard to information the respondent now had in his possession, but which was not available to the Magistrate. Secondly, the Attorney General had no prior notice of the new matters sought to be argued. Accordingly, the Court determined that the appeal should be confined to an appeal against the determination made by the Magistrate. However, if the Court upholds the appeal, it will be without prejudice to the respondent’s right to issue a further subpoena seeking to advance any other legitimate forensic purpose, other than that the subject of this appeal.  
     
      
       
      The  
      Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act  
      1997 
       
      
    46 The respondent’s case, as recast by the Magistrate, was based upon possible impropriety flowing from the grant of the Controlled Operation Authorities pursuant to s 6 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act. The long title of the Act states that it is: 
     
      
       
        
        “An Act with respect to the authorisation, conduct and monitoring of certain operations conducted by law enforcement agencies; and for other purposes.” 
        
       
      
    47 A “controlled operation” is defined in s 3 to mean: 
     
      
       
        
        “… an operation conducted for the purpose of:  
         
         
        (a) obtaining evidence of criminal activity or corrupt conduct, or 
         
         
        (b) arresting any person involved in criminal activity or corrupt conduct, or 
         
         
        (c) frustrating criminal activity or corrupt conduct, or 
         
         
        (d) carrying out an activity that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the achievement of any purpose referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c), 
         
         
        being an operation that involves, or may involve, a controlled activity.” 
        
       
      
    48 A “controlled activity” is defined to mean “an activity that, but for section 16, would be unlawful”. Section 16 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        16 Lawfulness of controlled activities 
         
         
        Despite any other Act or law, an activity that is engaged in by a participant in an authorised operation in the course of, and for the purposes of, the operation is not unlawful, and does not constitute an offence or corrupt conduct, so long as it is authorised by, and is engaged in in accordance with, the authority for the operation.” 
        
       
      
    49 Part 2 of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act provides for the authorisation of controlled operations. Sections 5, 6 and 7 are central to the issue in this case. They provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5 Applications for authorities 
         
         
        (1) A law enforcement officer for a law enforcement agency may apply to the chief executive officer of the agency for authority to conduct a controlled operation on behalf of the agency.” 
        
       
       
      An application is to be by means of a written document (a formal application) or, in the case of an urgent application, by such other means as available: s 5(2). The matter before this Court relates to a formal application, made under s 5(2).  
       
      
    50 An application must contain the following particulars: 
     
      
       
        
        “5(2A) In any application, whether formal or urgent, the applicant must provide the following particulars:  
         
         
        (a) a plan of the proposed operation, 
         
         
          
          (b) the nature of the criminal activity or corrupt conduct in respect of which the proposed operation is to be conducted, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the nature of the controlled activity in respect of which an authority is sought, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) a statement of whether or not the proposed operation, or any other controlled operation with respect to the same criminal activity or corrupt conduct, has been the subject of an earlier application for an authority or variation of an authority and, if so, whether or not the authority was given or variation granted.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The Chief Executive Officer, to whom an application is made, may require additional information to be furnished: s 5(3).  
       
      
    51 Section 6 provides for the determination of applications as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6 Determination of applications 
         
         
        (1) After considering an application for authority to conduct a controlled operation, and any additional information furnished under section 5 (3), the chief executive officer:  
         
         
          
          (a) may authorise a law enforcement officer for the law enforcement agency concerned to conduct the operation, either unconditionally or subject to conditions, or 
          
         
         
        (b) may refuse the application. 
         
         
        (2) An authority to conduct a controlled operation on behalf of a law enforcement agency may not be granted unless a code of conduct is prescribed by the regulations in relation to that agency. 
         
         
        (3) An authority to conduct a controlled operation may not be granted unless the chief executive officer is satisfied as to the following matters:  
         
         
          
          (a) that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that criminal activity or corrupt conduct has been, is being or is about to be conducted in relation to matters within the administrative responsibility of the agency, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct are such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation, 
          
         
         
          
          (c) that the nature and extent of the proposed controlled activities are appropriate to the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct, 
          
         
         
          
          (d) that the proposed controlled activities will be capable of being accounted for in sufficient detail to enable the reporting requirements of this Act to be fully complied with. 
          
         
         
        (4) In considering the matters referred to in subsection (3), the chief executive officer must have regard to the following:  
         
         
          
          (a) the reliability of any information as to the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct, 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the likelihood of success of the proposed controlled operation compared with the likelihood of success of any other law enforcement operation that it would be reasonably practicable to conduct for the same purposes, 
          
         
         
        (c) the duration of the proposed controlled operation.” 
        
       
      
    52 Section 7 proscribes the authorisation of entrapment activities. It provides:

        7 Certain matters not to be authorised 
         
         
        (1) An authority to conduct a controlled operation must not be granted in relation to a proposed operation that involves any participant in the operation:  
         
         
          
          (a) inducing or encouraging another person to engage in criminal activity or corrupt conduct of a kind that the other person could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so induced or encouraged …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    53 Relevantly, for present purposes, an authority to conduct a controlled operation is granted by means of a written document: s 8(1). Section 8(2) prescribes the content of the authority as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “8(2) An authority, whether formal or urgent:  
         
         
          
          (a) must identify the operation by reference to the plan referred to in section 5 (2A) (a), and 
          
         
         
          
          … 
          
         
         
        (e) must identify:  
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) with respect to the law enforcement participants, the nature of the controlled activities that those participants may engage in, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) with respect to the civilian participants, the particular controlled activities (if any) that each such participant may engage in, and 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          … 
          
         
         
          
          (h) must specify any conditions to which the conduct of the operation is subject under section 6 (1) (a).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    54 Section 13 provides for the effect of an authority:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        13 Effect of authorities 
         
         
        While it has effect, an authority for a controlled operation:  
         
         
        (a) authorises each law enforcement participant to engage in the controlled activities specified in the authority in respect of the law enforcement participants …” 
        
       
      
    55 Section 13A protects the validity of an authority in the case of a procedural defect in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        13A Defect in authority 
         
         
        An application for an authority or variation of authority, and any authority or variation of authority granted on the basis of such an application, is not invalidated by any procedural defect, other than a defect that affects the substance of the application, authority or variation in a material particular.” 
        
       
      
    56 Parts 3 (ss 14 to 20) and 4 (ss 21 to 24) of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act govern the conduct and monitoring of controlled operations respectively. Section 15 provides that within two months after completing an authorised operation, the principal law enforcement officer for the operation must cause a report on the operation to be given to the Chief Executive Officer. Section 16 has already been referred to above. Codes of conduct are prescribed by regulation under s 20.  
     
      
    57 The Chief Executive Officer must cause written notice of the granting of an authority under s 6 and of receiving a report of the operation under s 15, to be given to the Ombudsman within 21 days of either the grant of the authority: s 21(1)(a); or the receipt of the report: s 21(1)(b). The Ombudsman has an obligation to inspect the records of each law enforcement agency at least once every 12 months and may do so at any time to ascertain whether or not the requirements of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act are being complied with: s 22. The Ombudsman must also provide an annual report to Parliament of the work and activities undertaken by the Ombudsman under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act: s 23. 
     
      
       
      Principles governing legitimate forensic purpose 
       
      
    58 The principles that govern the application of a party to produce documents pursuant to a subpoena are well settled. In this regard, the basic principle was stated by Jordan CJ in Commissioner for Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 575: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a party is no more entitled to use a subpoena … than he is a summons for interrogatories, for the purposes of ‘fishing’, i.e., endeavouring, not to obtain evidence to support his case,  
        but to discover whether he has a case at all 
         …” (Emphasis added) (Citations omitted) 
        
       
       
      Mere relevance not sufficient 
       
      
    59 It is not sufficient for a party seeking production of documents to merely establish that such documents are or may be relevant. This is apparent from the comments of Mahoney AP in Carroll v Attorney-General for New South Wales (1993) 70 A Crim R 162. In that case, Mahoney AP was concerned with the question whether access should be given to certain documents that had been subpoenaed in criminal proceedings. His Honour said, at 181: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the court must, in general, be satisfied that the documents are relevant to an issue for decision by the court in the litigation. It is not open to a party, as on a ‘fishing expedition’, to subpoena documents merely in order to determine whether they may be relevant  
        and may be of assistance to his case in the proceeding 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    60 His Honour stated, at 182, that whilst a party must show, or it must appear, that the subpoenaed documents are relevant to an issue in the proceedings, “mere relevance is not enough”. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case in which the party did not know what was the nature or the contents of the documents, the position would be plain. He could not claim to look at the documents merely to see whether they contained something which might be relevant or help his case. But in this case it is accepted that the documents are affidavits directed to showing ‘that there are reasonable grounds for’ the ‘suspicion or belief’ referred to in s 16(1). Accordingly, prima facie the documents are relevant to the issue to be decided, viz, whether there was in fact no material that could reasonably justify the relevant belief. But, in my opinion, it is not sufficient for a party subpoenaing the document to say ‘the document is relevant because, if it does anything, it establishes the case against me’. He must be able to indicate that the document is relevant in the sense that it may assist his case. In the present case, that could not be claimed. Nor was it shown. At best, the claim was: ‘I wish to see the document to see if it may assist my case.’ That, in my opinion, is not sufficient.” 
        
       
      
    61 Senior counsel for the respondent submitted that the judgment of Mahoney AP did not represent a majority statement on this issue, nor had it been endorsed or applied in later decisions.  
     
      
    62 Neither Kirby ACJ (as his Honour then was) (who dissented on the facts) nor Hunt AJA (who agreed with Mahoney AP in the result) made any reference to “mere relevance”. However, each applied a test of “forensic purpose” and the need for it to be “on the cards” that the documents would “materially assist the accused”. Accordingly, the second element of the ‘test’, that is, that it must be “on the cards” that documents would materially assist the case, subsumes in it the notion that “mere relevance” is insufficient. Documents may be relevant even if they do not assist a party’s case. To that extent therefore, there is no difference in principle in the test applied by each of the members of the Court. 
     
      
    63 But in any event (and contrary to the respondent’s submissions) the statement of Mahoney AP has been applied in subsequent decisions in New South Wales and Victoria: see Propend Finance Pty Ltd v Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police (1994) 72 A Crim R 278 at 282-283; Bruce Harvey v State of New South Wales (Supreme Court of New South Wales, per Johnson J at 3-4, 15 June 2005, unreported); R v Robinson (1996) 89 A Crim R 42 at 61; Gardiner v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 190; (2006) 162 A Crim R 233 at [88]; and Re Don [2006] NSWSC 1125 at [6]. 
     
      
       
      The correct test 
       
      
    64 The test for determining whether a party is required to produce documents pursuant to a subpoena was stated by Simpson J (Spigelman CJ and Studdert J agreeing) in Regina v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86 at [11], in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles governing applications [for an order that documents not be produced] are no different from those governing applications for access to documents produced in answer to a subpoena. Before access is granted (or an order to produce made) the applicant must (i) identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought; and (ii) establish that it is ‘on the cards’ that the documents will materially assist his case. So much was established in earlier proceedings brought by this applicant:  
        R v Saleam  
        (1989) 16 NSWLR 14, per Hunt CJ at CL; see also  
        R v Ali Tastan 
         (1994) 75 A Crim R 498 per Barr AJ, as he then was.” 
        
       
       
      (I will refer to this case as  
      R v Saleam 
       [1999].) 
       
      
    65 The genesis of the expression “on the cards” is to be found in the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Alister v R [1983] HCA 45; (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414. In Alister, the High Court was concerned with a subpoena issued to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) in the course of a criminal trial for conspiracy to murder and attempt to murder. The police (acting upon information provided by an informant) had been able to foil the conspiracy, which involved an intention to murder by exploding a bomb near the intended victim’s home. The case was notorious – the accused members of Ananda Marga had been suspected of placing a bomb outside the Hilton Hotel in Sydney, in an attempt to kill the Prime Minister of India. The subpoena had required ASIO to produce all files and documents relating to the informant in respect of ASIO’s investigation of Ananda Marga. The Attorney General for the Commonwealth objected to the production on security-based public interest grounds.  
     
      
    66 Gibbs CJ, at 414, noted that the applicants who had sought the production of the documents were not able to state whether or not the documents existed, or if they did, whether they were likely to assist the applicant’s case. His Honour observed, however, that it was not unreasonable to believe that documents were in existence and that “one would guess that any reports … would be adverse to the applicants”. His Honour referred to the conflicting position in England as to the circumstances in which a court would inspect documents in a case where public interest immunity was claimed. It is necessary to set out that passage in full, in order to understand the context in which his Honour introduced the terms “on the cards”. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just as in the balancing process the scales must swing in favour of discovery if the documents are necessary to support the defence of an accused person whose liberty is at stake in a criminal trial, so, in considering whether to inspect documents for the purpose of deciding whether they should be disclosed, the court must attach special weight to the fact that the documents may support the defence of an accused person in criminal proceedings.  
        Although a mere ‘fishing’ expedition can never be allowed, it may be enough that it appears to be ‘on the cards’ that the documents will materially assist the defence 
        .” (Emphasis added) (Citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    67 It is both important and instructive to understand the manner in which Gibbs CJ saw this test operating at a practical level. He said, as a continuation of the passage just quoted:  
     
      
       
        
        “If, for example, it were known that an important witness for the Crown had given a report on the case to ASIO it would not be right to refuse disclosure simply because there were no grounds for thinking that the report could assist the accused. To refuse discovery only for that reason would leave the accused with a legitimate sense of grievance, since he would not be able to test the evidence of the witness by comparing it with the report, and would be likely to give rise to the reproach that justice had not been seen to be done.”  
        
       
      
    68 The approach of Gibbs CJ in Alister has been consistently adopted and applied in this State. An early, useful example is Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court v Tastan. Barr AJ (as his Honour then was) said, at 499, that there will be no legitimate forensic purpose if, “all the party is doing is trying to get hold of the documents to see whether they may assist him in his case”: see The Commissioner for Railways v Small. His Honour noted that there was nothing in the case before him that made it appear to be “on the cards” that anything contained in the subpoenaed documents was likely to materially assist the accused in his defence. His Honour considered, at 506, that the defendant wanted access to the documents “to see whether he had a [defence]”.  
     
      
    69 Hunt J (Carruthers and Grove JJ agreeing) applied the “on the cards” test in an earlier Saleam case: R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14, and permitted access to documents in circumstances that were redolent of the example given by Gibbs J in Alister. The subpoena in this case had been issued during the appeal process. It was argued that there was material in the subpoenaed material that would indicate that there had been a miscarriage of justice at trial. The accused had been told by a police officer seconded to the Ombudsman’s office that “that there were discrepancies in the police case” at the trial. It was not disputed that such a statement had been made. The accused claimed that the subpoenaed material would be relevant to impugn the credit of the principal Crown witness at trial. The Court allowed access to the documents on the basis that it was “at least ‘on the cards’ that the documents in question would assist the appellant in his appeal and that there was therefore a legitimate forensic purpose for the production of the documents”. 
     
      
    70 The Attorney General indicated that Simpson J’s formulation in R v Saleam [1999] represented the commencement of a line of authority in which the test for the production of, or access to, documents, was specifically stated as comprising two steps: a legitimate forensic purpose and that it was “on the cards” that the documents would materially assist the case. However, in stating the test in this specific ‘two step’ way, her Honour did not state any new principle. As I have already stated at [64], in the authorities that preceded R v Saleam [1999], including Alister, the courts, in determining whether access would be granted to documents sought on subpoena, have always applied a test that involves determining whether each of the factors identified by Simpson J had been established. 
     
      
       
      Other statements of the test 
       
      
    71 The respondent did not dispute that the ‘two step’ process represented the law, as it stood in this Court, in respect of a challenge of the type that was made to the production of documents here. However, he referred the Court to two recent decisions, both of first instance judges, to demonstrate that there has been a change in the principles (or at least the emphasis found in those principles) that apply from those stated by Simpson J in R v Saleam [1999]. The first is Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Conolly [2003] NSWSC 327; 57 NSWLR 310 per Adams J. The second is Ragg v Magistrates' Court of Victoria & Corcoris [2008] VSC 1 per Bell J.  
     
      
    72 In Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Conolly, Adams J referred to a decision of Balmford J in Fitzgerald v Magistrate’s Court of Victoria [2001] VSC 348; [2001] 34 MVR 448, in which her Honour, at [20], stated, “I note that in the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary ‘on the cards’ is defined as meaning ‘within the range of probability’”. Adams J said at [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Accepting this to be so, it seems to me that the relevant “range” is therefore between the barely probable and highly probable. With respect, it seems to me that this area of the law is bedevilled with metaphors. I think the essential notion is that there is a reasonable chance that the material sought will assist the defence.  
        If it is reasonable to infer that the material sought exists and that it is relevant to an issue, though its content is unknown, it will almost invariably be logically the case (as it seems to me) that such a chance exists, even though it might be thought to be unlikely. Seeking that material therefore seems to me to be a legitimate forensic purpose, providing of course that the factual issues and the character of the material sought are precisely identified 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    73 Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Conolly was referred to in Ragg v Magistrates' Court of Victoria. The respondent submitted that it was referred to with approval. I am not sure that is correct. In Ragg, Bell J referred to Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Conolly in an historical sense, during the course of his consideration of whether the test stated by Gibbs CJ in Alister had “perhaps outlived its usefulness”: see Ragg at [92]-[94]. Bell J also considered that Gibbs CJ did not use the metaphor to explain a test of “probability”.  
     
      
    74 Bell J referred to Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Conolly and two decisions of the Victorian Supreme Court to determine how the courts should state “with greater certainty the test given to us by Gibbs CJ”. His Honour referred to DPP v Selway [2007] VSC 244, where Cummins J had stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the basis of the above authorities, I consider the true test is whether there is a reasonable possibility that the sought-for information would materially assist the defence. Probability is too high a standard. Mere possibility is too low. The adverb ‘reasonably’ gives proper scope to the judge to determine the issue responsibly and objectively. Such a standard also is consonant with the principles of open justice.” 
        
       
      
    75 Bell J then said, at [95], that  
     
      
       
        
        “I would adopt this approach, not only because it is not clearly wrong, but because I think it is correct. More specifically, a ‘reasonably possibility’ test expresses in more certain language what Gibbs CJ probably had in mind when he used the ‘on the cards’ metaphor in  
        Alister v R 
        , gives proper effect to the underlying fundamental duty of the court to ensure a fair trial … With respect, I would not follow the judgment of Balmford J in  
        Fitzgerald v Magistrates’ Court 
         that ‘on the cards’ means ‘within the range of probability’ because it is clearly incorrect.” (Citations omitted) 
        
       
       
      His Honour concluded, at [96]: 
       
       
        
        “In summary, an accused person is entitled to seek production of such documents as are necessary for the conduct of a fair trial between the prosecution and the defence of the criminal charges that have been brought. When objection is taken, the accused must identify expressly and with precision the forensic purpose for which access to the documents is sought. A legitimate purpose is demonstrated where the court considers, having regard to its fundamental duty to ensure a fair trial, that there is a reasonable possibility the documents will materially assist the defence. That is a low threshold, but it is a threshold.” 
        
       
      
    76 His Honour did not, in his working out of the most appropriate statement of the test, directly endorse the language of Adams J in Roads & Traffic Authority of NSW v Conolly, nor, more relevantly, for present purposes, did he engage in any critical analysis of his Honour’s approach. Further, although the Victorian Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 which commenced on 1 January 2008 did not apply to the proceedings, Bell J expressed the view that international human rights were relevant to the question being determined and made frequent references throughout the judgment to the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights.  
     
      
    77 For myself, I have some difficulty with Adams J’s approach. In the first place, it uses quite different language from that which has been applied in this State consistently since Alister. Further, the language used by Adams J has its own difficulties. The word “chance”, used by his Honour, is itself a word of equivocal meaning. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it can mean either a “possibility” or a “probability”. It is apparent from Adams J’s reasoning on the point that he intended to use it in the sense of “possibility”. On that reading, the test appears to be the same as that endorsed by Bell J in Ragg v Magistrates' Court of Victoria. However, it is the next portion of Adams J’s comments that concern me. I will set out again the passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “If it is reasonable to infer that the material sought exists and that it is relevant to an issue, though its content is unknown, it will almost invariably be logically the case (as it seems to me) that such a chance exists, even though it might be thought to be unlikely. Seeking that material therefore seems to me to be a legitimate forensic purpose, providing of course that the factual issues and the character of the material sought are precisely identified.”  
        
       
      
    78 In my opinion, this passage substantially changes the notion contained in the earlier passage, that there must be a ‘reasonable chance’ (or possibility) that the documents will assist the accused’s case, and reduces the test to one of mere relevance, provided the documents exist (or it is reasonable to infer that the documents do exist). It is apparent that this is the effect of his Honour’s reasons is apparent from his comment that if the “material sought exists and … is relevant to an issue, though its content is unknown, it will almost invariably be logically the case … that such a chance [that the documents will assist the accused’s case] exists” (additional emphasis). His Honour’s additional comment, “even though it might be thought to be unlikely” (that the documents will assist the accused’s case) pitches the test at a much lower threshold than that contained in the test stated in R v Saleam [1999], that it must be “on the cards” that the documents will materially assist the case. Indeed, it casts the test as a lower threshold than is contained in the test of “reasonable chance” that Adams J himself used.  
     
      
    79 The likely effect of his Honour’s approach is to create a situation whereby, provided relevance is established, there will almost always be a “reasonable chance” that the material will assist an applicant seeking production of documents to establish the case proposed be made at the trial. As is apparent from Alister, Carroll and R v Saleam [1999], something more than that is required and in my opinion the approach of Adams J should not be followed. 
     
      
    80 The test stated by Bell J in Ragg v Magistrates' Court of Victoria doesn’t necessarily have the same effect as that which flows from the reasons of Adams J taken in their entirety. In particular, I do not understand Bell J to be indicating that mere relevance is sufficient. However, I see no reason to depart from the language used by Simpson J in this Court in R v Saleam [1999]. To do so only invites confusion. This Court has already stated what the test is and in my opinion, should continue to apply that test in accordance with the language used in the form in which it has stood since Alister and R v Saleam [1999].  
     
      
       
      Legitimate forensic purpose as found by the Magistrate 
       
      
    81 At this point it is necessary to return to the legitimate forensic purpose as found by the Magistrate to determine whether, in accordance with the principles stated in R v Saleam [1999], there is a legitimate forensic purpose and whether it is “on the cards” that the material subpoenaed will assist the respondent’s defence at trial.  
     
      
    82 It was relevant to the Magistrate’s determination that the documents subpoenaed were documents that were required to be brought into existence by the provisions of s 5(2A) of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act. The Magistrate considered that the respondent should be allowed access to the documents to “check” that there had been compliance with the requirements of s 5(2A). He said that this was a legitimate forensic purpose. His Honour then found that if there had been non-compliance with s 5(2A), it was “on the cards” that there could be mounted an argument under s 138 of the Evidence Act. The Attorney General challenged the correctness of this reasoning. 
     
      
    83 In this case, the nature of the documents, or at least some of them, was known at the time of the issue of the subpoena. Paragraph 3 of the schedule to the subpoena required production of at least the documents that had been brought into existence to satisfy the requirements of s 5(2A) of the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act. To that extent, it could not be said that the respondent was seeking to ascertain whether any documents existed, and if they existed, what those documents were. The s 5(2A) documents would be relevant to the criminal proceedings, because they were brought into existence for the purposes of authorising the purchase side of the supply transaction, which formed the actus reus of each offence with which the respondent was charged. The question remains, however, whether it has been demonstrated that it is “on the cards” that those documents will materially assist the respondent’s case.  
     
      
    84 Notwithstanding that the subpoena sought documents that were identifiable, I am of the opinion that the legitimate forensic purpose identified by the Magistrate amounts to no more than a proposition that the respondent was entitled to engage in a “fishing expedition” to ascertain whether there had been compliance with s 5(2A). That is apparent from the terms in which the Magistrate identified the forensic purpose. There was no material before the Magistrate to indicate that there had been, or might have been, non-compliance with s 5(2A).  
     
      
    85 This is acknowledged in his Honour’s comment that there should be access to the documents to enable the respondent to check whether there had been compliance with s 5(2A). In other words, the Magistrate identified the legitimate forensic purpose in terms that meant the respondent needed to have access to the documents “to discover whether he has a case at all”: see The Commissioner for Railways v Small at 575. As Jordan CJ stated in that case, a party is not entitled to use a subpoena for that purpose.  
     
      
    86 This was not a case like, or analogous to, the example given in Alister where an important witness had given a pre trial report so that it could be said that it was “on the cards” that the document “would materially assist” the respondent by permitting cross-examination of the witness based on the earlier report. Nor was it a case like that which Hunt J had dealt with in Saleam, where there was some evidence that there was a problem with the evidence given at trial and the material subpoenaed may have revealed whether that was the case. Here, there was no suggestion that the police witnesses had made earlier statements that should be available for the purposes of cross-examination. Nor was there any suggestion whatsoever that there was any failure to follow correct procedures, or that any wrongdoing had been engaged in. In short, there was nothing at all to suggest that it was “on the cards” that the subpoenaed material would “materially assist the [respondent’s case”.  
     
      
    87 It follows, in my opinion, that the Magistrate erred in law in allowing access to the material referred to in para 3 of the Schedule to the subpoena.  
     
      
       
      Proposed orders 
       
      
    88 I have already referred above to the manner in which the Court determined that this matter should proceed, namely, upon the error, if any, established on the Magistrate’s decision. As I have concluded that the Magistrate erred in law, the appeal should be allowed. In allowing the appeal, I would again stress that that is to be without prejudice to the respondent’s right to issue a further subpoena seeking to advance any legitimate forensic purpose other than that subject of determination in this appeal.  
     
      
    89 It is not apparent from the transcript that the Magistrate made a formal order dismissing the application to set aside para 3 of the schedule to the subpoena and the Court has not been favoured with a formal copy of the Local Court’s order. However, as his Honour stayed the operation of his determination, it must follow that he dismissed or rejected that application. I will formulate the orders on the appeal on the assumption that an order was made. Having found the error to which I have referred, the appropriate order, in my opinion, is to strike out para 3 of the schedule to the subpoena. Accordingly, the formal orders I would propose in the matter are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Set aside the determination of the Magistrate, his Honour G Cocks, made on 21 July 2006, dismissing the application to set aside paragraph 3 of the schedule to the subpoena issued on 24 May 2006; 
       
       
      3. Strike out paragraph 3 of the subpoena.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Matthew Mark Renehan appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty on an earlier occasion to two offences involving the supply of drugs. The first is supplying methylamphetamine on an ongoing basis and the second is the offence of supplying a drug. These offences relate to the activities of Mr Renehan in June and July 2007. 2 The matter came to the attention of police when an undercover officer contacted Mr Renehan on his mobile telephone. This was on 27 June 2007. the undercover officer discussed the purchase of what is called an eight ball of amphetamine and so it was that on 28 June 2007 the undercover officer went to a hotel in Gladesville where he met the offender and a man by the name of Benjamin McDonald. There a transaction took place whereby the offender supplied the undercover officer with a clear plastic satchel containing a yellow coloured paste substance which proved upon analysis to be methylamphetamine with a total weight of 3.3 grams and a purity of 13½ per cent. The undercover officer paid $400 for this drug. A short time later, in mid-July 2007, there were further negotiations culminating in the supply of a further quantity of drugs for $400 - this time 3.1 grams with a purity of, again, 13½ per cent. This time the transaction took place at a McDonald’s on Lane Cove Road at Ryde.3 The third occasion of supply for the ongoing supply offence was on 19 July 2007. The day before, the undercover officer had contacted the offender’s mobile phone and arranged to receive a further eight ball of amphetamine the following day. This transaction took place at McDonald’s at Ryde. When the offender arrived in his car he got out and went into the undercover officer’s vehicle where again a transaction took place. This time it cost $450 for the supply of 3.2 grams of methylamphetamine, this ,on analysis, turning out to have a purity of 11 per cent. 4 Those three occasions represent the three ongoing supplies, the subject of the first count on the indictment. During this last transaction the undercover officer raised with the offender the prospect of getting a supply involving a greater quantity. He said, “What’s the chance of getting an ounce?” The offender said, “base?” When the undercover officer said, “Yeah.” The offender said, “Yeah, easy.” He quoted about $2500 for that supply. 5 I mention this conversation because of a submission put to me that the offender was reluctant in his drug dealings. I will come back to that issue later. This conversation took place on 19 July. There was a further conversation between the offender and the undercover officer on 25 July. The undercover officer said, “I was still after that one if that is okay?” The offender said, “It shouldn’t be a problem, I’ll have to make a couple of phone calls and get back to you in about an hour.” The offender confirmed that the price was still $2500. The offender did contact the undercover officer some hours later and said that he could not do the deal that day but would telephone him the following morning. The next day the undercover officer tried to contact the offender on his mobile phone but was unsuccessful. It turns out that the offender was ill. However, Mr McDonald took over matters, he contacted the undercover officer and told him that he would be able to supply the ounce and so at about 10.20am on 28 July 2007 the undercover officer met Mr McDonald. Mr McDonald supplied twenty-four grams of methylamphetamine with a purity of 11½ per cent for $2200. After the transaction was completed the police arrested Mr McDonald, and a short time later they arrested the offender at his parent’s home where he was living.6 These are very serious offences. The offender was prepared to get involved in the evil drug trade in order to both support Mr McDonald (so he says,) and get his drugs for free. Parliament has recognised the seriousness of such conduct by providing for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty years for the offence of ongoing supply and fifteen years for the second count on the indictment for supplying methylamphetamine. 7 I mentioned during the course of my recitation of the facts in this matter that there was a submission that the offender was reluctant to become involved in his drug dealings. The objective circumstances suggest otherwise, at least at the start of his criminal activities. In fact, they suggest enthusiasm. The evidence suggested that the offender became involved in drug dealing when he met a person by the name of Lindsay in the early hours of one morning after he had been drinking a lot. He agreed at Lindsay’s request to supply him some drugs, even writing out a price list on a beer coaster. Later on, when the undercover officer contacted the offender he said that he was a friend of Lindsay’s and referred to the price list on the beer coaster during their negotiations. The fact that the offender was prepared to write out a price list on a beer coaster suggests other than reluctance to become involved in drug supply activities. It is said that he was drunk at the time when Lindsay first approached him but his attitude does not appear to have changed once he sobered up. Enthusiasm can also be found in the offender’s evidence that he used his IT sales skills in an effort to sell more drugs. The evidence was that he told the undercover officer at one stage that he was involved in other drug supplies. He said in evidence today that this was not true but he wanted to keep his customers happy because he wanted to sell more drugs. A third factor suggesting enthusiasm, rather than reluctance, is the offender’s response once the undercover officer raises the prospect of an ounce of methylamphetamine being supplied. 8 The only evidence of reluctance comes from the offender, himself, when he says that on 26 July he refused to take any telephone calls from the undercover officer. I am prepared to accept that that decision to refuse to take calls arose from reluctance to become involved in the supply of the ounce. But I am not prepared to find that up until that time the offender was other than an enthusiastic drug supplier. 9 At this stage I raise an issue concerning the role of the offender and Mr McDonald. Judge English sentenced Mr McDonald earlier this year. He was sentenced only for his involvement in the supply of the ounce on 28 July 2007 and did not face any charges in relation to the ongoing supply matter faced by this offender. Indeed, Judge English sentenced Mr McDonald on the basis that his involvement was a “one off”. She also sentenced him on the basis that he got involved because he was doing a favour for this offender. Completely the opposite suggestion is made in these proceedings. It is suggested by the offender that he was less involved that Mr McDonald and that he was helping Mr McDonald with his finances by supplying drugs. In other words, the offender blames Mr McDonald and Mr McDonald blamed the offender. It would have been better, of course, if the offender and Mr McDonald had been sentenced at the same time before the same judge. It would have been interesting to know what Mr McDonald might have said about the circumstances in which he became the person who did the actual supply of the ounce of amphetamine on 28 July 2007. But that has not come about. I raised with the Crown during the course of the submissions the concern that I felt about the way in which the sentencing matters had proceeded. Nevertheless, I have to deal with the matter as it becomes before me today and that is that there is uncontradicted evidence about the offender’s reluctance to actually supply the ounce of amphetamine he had previously agreed to supply. 10 In the light of that uncontradicted evidence I will sentence him on the basis that he was beginning to have second thoughts about his activities by the time count two came about. I repeat that I am giving the offender the benefit of the doubt on this issue. 11 The offender is a man who had many advantages in life as he was growing up. He comes from a family which supports him. His parents separated after a short time of marriage but his father remains very supportive of him and his stepfather regards him as his son. 12 I gather that the family was not suffering any particular hardship of a financial kind as the offender grew up. He attended school to year 12 and whilst in year 12 undertook parallel education in TAFE pursuing tech drawing and tech studies. He commenced working on a part time basis in year 10. Upon leaving school he managed to obtain various forms of employment before he managed to get a job which interested him, and which he was good at, in IT sales and support. He has a nine year old daughter from a previous relationship. He supports his daughter and gets on well with her mother. He has a relationship with his fiancée, Michelle. They have been together for a number of years and indeed the offender proposed to Michelle in July 2007 at the very time that these offences were being committed. 13 The offender thus had many advantages in life which are denied many people who come before the courts. He, however, has not taken advantage of those circumstances. Instead, he has chosen, and I use the word “chosen” carefully, to become involved in very serious criminal activity. 14 Shortly before his involvement in these matters the offender suffered a number of losses. His grandmother died; a school friend died in strange circumstances; a friend of his committed suicide; as did a former neighbour. The offender seems to have reacted to these stressors by commencing a period of heavy drinking and gambling. The offender’s fiancée gave evidence before me today and she said that he became a different person, less willing to talk about things with her and going out without letting her know where he was going. He also recommenced recreational drug use. He had earlier taken drugs for about four years but gave them up in 1999. The offender is lucky that his family still support him and that his fiancée has indicated a willingness to stand by him. A reference was also tendered from his employer today. His employer speaks of him not only as an employee but also as someone whose character he knows and has been able to assess. 15 The offender is a person who has done much good in the world. He has, as I said, supported his daughter. He has been gainfully employed since leaving school and he apparently is good at his job. On the other hand, he did decide in the middle of last year to become a drug dealer. He said that his motive for offending was twofold. That he would get his drugs to use recreationally for free but also he was going to help Mr McDonald who was going through financial difficulties at the time. There is something of a paradox here, however. Mr McDonald’s financial circumstances were unlikely to be significantly improved by any small scale drug dealing. The offender’s motivation for helping his friend must have included a motivation to sell many more drugs than he actually did. He was really only going to help Mr McDonald if he got involved in drug supply at a much deeper level than that for which he is to be sentenced today. It is for this reason that he was prepared to use his IT sales skills when speaking to the undercover officer in order to sell more drugs. So although the offender seeks to rely on the circumstance that he was trying to help Mr McDonald, the fact that he could only really help Mr McDonald by becoming a serious and larger scale drug dealer is something which actually counts against him. It illustrates the offender’s preparedness to supply drugs at a much more significant level and that in turn illustrates his character, at least in the middle of last year. 16 Mr Nicholls, who appears for the offender, suggested that I should impose a suspended sentence on his client. When he raised that submission with me, Mr Nicholls recognised that he faced two hurdles. The first was that the length of the sentence I imposed upon his client had to be such that suspension was available. The second hurdle was that the Court of Criminal Appeal has repeatedly said that for trafficking of this nature a full time custodial sentence is required unless circumstances are exceptional. Mr Nicholls accepted that a sentence of imprisonment was required but hung his hat on the idea of a suspended sentence. Mr Nicholls addressed me as to why it was that circumstances were exceptional. I will take those matters into account also when deciding the length of the appropriate sentence.17 One thing I will not give significant weight to is the hardship to the third parties which may arise from the offender’s imprisonment. I mentioned on a couple of occasions earlier that the offender supports his nine year old daughter. She will no doubt suffer in the event that the offender is sent to gaol but such consequences are unfortunately commonplace when those who have responsibilities for others decide to get involved in serious criminal activity. One thing I will take into account, however, in relation to the offender’s daughter is that his time in custody will be harder because of his knowledge that through his actions he has deprived his daughter of the support he was previously providing.18 The issue of parity arises in relation to count two on the indictment. Comparing the facts upon which Mr McDonald was sentenced with those on which I will sentence the offender, it can be seen that this offender was objectively less involved, as I have said, because of a reluctance on his part to go through with what he had agreed to do. There are many similarities between Mr McDonald and the offender in relation to their age. A finding in Mr McDonald’s case that he was less responsible for his actions than others might have been, also arises here, because of the circumstance in which the offender became stressed, drank more than he should and thus became involved in drug dealing. Also, in common is the circumstances of the early pleas of guilty. As far as the character of Mr McDonald is concerned and comparing that with the character of the accused the offender has one prior matter of a PCA offence but in contrast to Mr McDonald the commission of count two on this indictment is not a one off offence. The offender’s character is someone who was prepared to become involved in other drug dealing apart from count two and was also someone who had been prepared to illegally use drugs in the past.19 Mr Nicholls made no submission that I would find special circumstances. Nevertheless I will find special circumstances this being the offender’s first time in custody. I will, therefore, enlarge the period of eligibility for parole at the expense of a non-parole period. I accept that the offender today is a very different person from the offender who committed these offences in the middle of last year. But that does not make punishment inappropriate. I accept that the experience of being in custody for nineteen days has provided a salutary lesson to the accused and that his prospects of rehabilitation are good. But my task is not simply to look at the offender. My task is to look at the community as a whole and impose a sentence which does what I can to protect the community from drug dealers ,whether they become involved because of the stressors that Mr Renehan felt or whether they become involved for pure greed. It is important that sentencing judges mark in a concrete and unmistakable way just how wrong it is for people to decide to supply drugs to others. 20 Consistent with proper practice I have firstly decided, as was conceded by Mr Nicholls, that a period of imprisonment is required. I have next decided the length of the two sentences. I am satisfied that a period of accumulation is required to reflect the separate acts of criminality involved in the ongoing supply matter and the decision to become involved in the supply of a larger quantity on 28 July 2007. Having made that decision it is apparent that suspension of the sentences is not an option. Periodic detention is available but it would be insufficient to punish the offender for his wrongdoing. One of the fundamental rules in sentencing is that the sentence has to reflect the objective gravity of the offender’s conduct. As I have tried to explain the offender was gravely involved in serious criminal activity and the only available option is a sentence of full time custody. 21 On count two the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months. That is a fixed term because of the next sentence I will impose. That sentence is to have commenced on 27 February 2008. 22 On count one the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of twelve months to commence on 27 August 2008. I set a head sentence of two years. The overall sentence is thus one of two and a half years with an eighteen month non-parole period. The offender is to be released to parole on 26 August 2009.23 Anything else, Mr Crown, Mr Nicholls?24 HENDERSON: Your Honour, just an order for the destruction of the drugs.25 HIS HONOUR: I think they have already been destroyed but I will make an order that the drugs are to be destroyed.

    12 MARCH 2008  2007 /2246 REGINA V LUKE MACIUK   JUDGMENT AND VERDICT 
     
      
        
      1  HIS HONOUR : The accused, Luke Maciuk, is charged that between 22 January and 8 March 2006 at Tabulam, New South Wales he murdered Mykalaj Charles Maciuk. When arraigned at the commencement of the trial on 3 March 2008 the accused pleaded that he was not guilty by reason of mental illness. Before that day he had elected for trial by judge alone. His form of election, made on 21 February 2008, and the Crown’s consent, made on 26 February 2008, are together exhibit A.  
         
      2  The first piece of evidence in the trial was the accused’s formal admission, made in writing and on the advice of his counsel, that between 22 January 2006 and 8 March 2006 he deliberately caused the death of Mykalaj Charles Maciuk. The burden of proving that he is not guilty by reason of mental illness lies on the accused. He must show on the balance of probabilities that he was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of his act or, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong. A person does not know that what he is doing is wrong if he does not know that it is wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable persons or when he cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness about the moral quality of what he is doing. The accused’s case is that when he killed the deceased he was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to reason with a moderate degree of calmness about the moral quality of the act that he did that caused the death of the deceased.  
         
      3  The accused is one of two children of the deceased and his former wife, Ms Kim Godfrey. He was born on 26 May 1983. He has an elder sister. The marriage of the deceased and Ms Godfrey broke down and they separated in 1997. They were later divorced. When they separated the accused and his sister lived with their mother. During that period, beginning in early 2002 Ms Godfrey noticed a change in the accused’s behaviour. On investigation she found bongs under his bed and realised that he was using cannabis. His sleeping and eating patterns changed and he lost a lot of weight. In July or August of the same year he began to exhibit signs of delusions and paranoia. He told his mother that the house in which they lived was bugged and that the bug was in the doorbell. She had to dismantle it in order to try to satisfy him that he was wrong. The house was by a river in which a dredge was working. He told his mother that there were spies in the dredge. The accused was adamant that people were after him and that there might possibly be listening devices elsewhere in the house.  
         
      4  Throughout this period of time the accused changed from an outgoing young man with lots of friends, who played sport and went to work apparently normally, to a different person. He started stealing from his mother. He took her laptop computer and pawned it. When the accused displayed his delusive and paranoid beliefs Ms Godfrey would try to calm him down and satisfy him that he had nothing to fear. However, his beliefs persisted. There were two occasions on which the accused threatened to commit suicide. With his mother’s encouragement he sought and received counselling and was seen by a general practitioner and, I think, a psychiatrist, though there was at that time no formal diagnosis of psychotic illness. There was an occasion when, after an argument, the accused raised his fist to his mother and threatened her. She asked him to leave the house and he did so. He went to live with the deceased.  
         
      5  In 2003 the deceased bought an olive farm on the Bruxner Highway at Yellow Creek, near Tabulam, and he and the accused moved to that property and resided there. The accused telephoned his mother and told her that the deceased was trying to poison him. He said that he had put rat poison in the milk. He asked her to come and get him. She went to collect him. He was agitated. He gave her a milk carton and asked her to have the milk tested to see what kind of poison was in it.  
         
      6  At about the same time the deceased telephoned Ms Godfrey and told her that the accused had been threatening him. She telephoned the Tweed Heads Mental Hospital Unit and asked for assistance but was told that there was nothing they could do unless she could bring the accused to the hospital. She went to the deceased’s place. The accused was there but had barricaded himself in his bedroom. The deceased told her that he had phoned for the police. The accused never did come out and there was nothing that Ms Godfrey could do. She just had to go home.  
      7  The accused had had a number of jobs and in September 2005 was working at a timber business. There was an accident at work in which a piece of timber hit him in the foot and caused some superficial injury. Those who had the medical care of him considered his reaction disproportionate. He was accusing his supervisor of having deliberately thrown the timber at him and claiming to have been much more seriously injured than the objective facts suggested. He told a psychiatrist, Dr Petroff, that he would not take the tablets Dr Petroff was recommending unless the supervisor were dismissed. Eventually, I think, his worker’s compensation benefits were cut off on the ground that he was exaggerating. Those having the care of him at that time had no knowledge of the events of 2002, of course, so no connection between those events and the work accident could be drawn. There was no diagnosis of psychotic illness, though I am satisfied that the accused was continuing to suffer from the psychosis which had first manifested itself in 2002.  
         
      8  By the end of 2005 the deceased was considering selling the olive farm. It was losing money and he was finding the work very hard. He complained to neighbours that he was receiving no assistance from the accused, who was smoking cannabis. There had been altercations between the two on a number of occasions and police had been called out to the property. The deceased told neighbours that the accused had threatened him and had done him injury. He told them that if he were killed they would know that the accused was responsible.  
         
      9  In late January or early February 2006 Ms Godfrey received two quite unusual telephone calls from the accused. His elder sister had recently graduated from university and had been admitted or was to be admitted as a legal practitioner. The accused told his mother that there had been some kind of government intervention in the way that his sister had been assisted to obtain her degree, linked somehow to Ms Godfrey’s father. Some kind of mining business was somehow involved as well, though what the accused was saying made no sense to Ms Godfrey. The conversation went on for a long time, probably an hour and a half, something quite unusual for the accused. Another telephone conversation occurred about the same time. The corporation AWB, formerly the Australian Wheat Board, had been in the news over its activities in Iraq. The accused told Ms Godfrey that he had written a letter to AWB and that she would be very proud of him. The purpose of the telephone call and the letter were unclear to Ms Godfrey, however.  
         
      10  The last time any of their neighbours saw the deceased was on about 14 January 2006. On 25 January a notice appeared in front of the farm advertising olives free of charge. Two neighbours called in to enquire about the notice. The dogs were loose, barking and apparently dangerous, but the accused did not appear. When he eventually did appear the neighbours found him very hard to engage in conversation. When he responded they thought him “like a zombie”. They thought that something was wrong and felt so uncomfortable that they left straight away. Another neighbour called on the following day, also attracted by the notice, and tried to engage the accused in conversation. He asked him where the deceased was. The accused simply ignored him.  
         
      11  I am satisfied that by the time of those events the accused had killed the deceased. He later disclosed to consulting psychiatrists that he had struck his father over the head with a hammer and, because he did not want him to suffer, had slit his throat with a knife. That account was consistent with the condition of the body when it was found. He said that he had burnt the blood stained chair on which his father had been sitting and had thrown into a river a dinner plate that bore his father’s blood. He had buried the body on the property.  
         
      12  The deceased’s family became concerned that they had not heard from him, and eventually the accused’s sister reported to the police that the deceased was missing. The police called at the property and asked the accused where the deceased was. He made up a story about the deceased having left about four weeks earlier to seek work at a country music festival. The police noticed that the deceased’s wallet, mobile telephone and car were all at the property and did not believe the accused’s story. The accused persisted with his unconvincing story and denied the possibility that the deceased was dead. Eventually a search was carried out and the deceased’s body was recovered.  
         
      13  The accused was arrested and interrogated. In an interview lasting two and one half hours he gave detailed answers to interrogating police officers insisting that he had nothing to do with the death of the deceased. He played down the seriousness of the reported incidents in which police had attended the property and insisted that he and the deceased had got on well together. On the face of it the account he gave was no different from lying denials that are frequently seen. However, I accept the evidence of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, that several of the answers give a grossly inadequate explanation of events and display poverty of thinking.  
         
      14  After the accused’s arrest Ms Godfrey went to the farm and found papers written by the accused. They came into evidence as exhibits 4, 5 and 6 respectively. Exhibit 5 is addressed to “Dear fellow producers, Aussies” and refers to a conversation the accused had had that day with an AWB employee. The sentences of which it consists comprise strings of clich After the accused’s arrest Ms Godfrey went to the farm and found papers written by the accused. They came into evidence as exhibits 4, 5 and 6 respectively. Exhibit 5 is addressed to “Dear fellow producers, Aussies” and refers to a conversation the accused had had that day with an AWB employee. The sentences of which it consists comprise strings of clichés, high sounding ideas and apparently unrelated statements of fact. The letter is nonsensical and bears no discernible ultimate meaning. The letter exhibit 6 is dated 15 February 2006. It is addressed to a man by name and is headed “Country Wide Equities Financial interest available for indicative enhance arise to lifestyle.” It touches upon a number of subjects including the attractiveness of the olive farm. Ultimately it has no discernible theme or meaning. The document exhibit 4 lists a number of unconnected statements or ideas, including the names and some asserted properties of certain minerals. Its meaning is entirely unclear.  
         
      15  All the psychiatrists who gave evidence agree, and I accept, that these three documents demonstrate that when he wrote them the accused was suffering from disordered thoughts. I accept their opinions that that is evidence of psychosis.  
         
      16  When investigating police called at the farm there was this conversation -  
         
      Accused So, can you offer me protection?   Officer Protection from who?   Accused I don’t know, whoever is out to get me. They’re making me starve and they’re out to get me.   Officer I think you’re a bit paranoid. Accused I am paranoid yes. There’s people out to get me and ruin my olive business. The people involved in the olives in Casino are out to get me. They come out here and take my olives.   Officer I know the people that run the olives in Casino. They have way more than you do. Why would they want to take your olives and ruin your business?   Accused I don’t know but I need protection. Officer I don’t think you are very being very honest with us are you?   Accused I think so oh, there are Italians on one side of the family. Officer Well, that makes all the difference. What do you mean by that?   Accused Well, I don’t know.   
      17  Four psychiatrists gave evidence, Dr Westmore and Professor Greenberg for the Crown and Dr Allnutt and Dr Nielssen for the defence. The Court had the considerable advantage of being able to hear Dr Westmore, Professor Greenberg and Dr Allnutt give evidence simultaneously, enabling counsel and the Court to invite any of them to comment upon the evidence of any other. In this way the Court was able to obtain a good understanding of the preponderance of psychiatric opinion and the limited respects in which there was a difference of opinion.  
         
      18  All four psychiatrists are of the view that the events of 2002 show the emergence in the accused of symptoms of psychosis. I think that Dr Nielssen was probably right when he said that it was not a drug induced psychosis but rather one whose presence had been made manifest by the accused’s excessive consumption of cannabis. I am satisfied that, whenever the psychosis began, it was well developed by 2002 when he was complaining to his mother about the bug in the doorbell and the spies on the dredge and in 2003 when he was complaining to her about the poison in the milk. I think that the bizarre complaints he was making about the minor work accident, laying unwarranted blame on the supervisor, resulted from his psychosis. Events much closer to the time of the death of the deceased show that the psychosis was continuing unabated. The letters and statement written by the accused and later found by his mother show that his thoughts were thoroughly disordered. His request to the police for protection show that he was motivated by an unreasoning and unreasonable fear.  
         
      19  There are some aspects of the case which have given rise to difficulty in the minds of the psychiatrists. There were rational and logical reasons why the accused and his father did not get on. They had over the years had arguments, even violent ones. The accused claimed that he had put money into the farm, and it is possible that he did so. He had a healthy resentment of his father’s intention to sell the farm. Such things might have combined in the mind of a reasoning person to justify doing something known to be morally wrong. The question is whether a link can be demonstrated to have existed between the psychotic state in which the accused undoubtedly was and the act causing death.  
         
      20  The evidence shows that the accused was probably suffering from a number of delusions when he killed the deceased. The first, which emerges from what he told Dr Nielssen in June 2006 and Dr Allnutt in March 2007, was that a neighbour called Mick, a member of a motor cycle gang involved in drugs, was going to kill him. His father was also involved.  
         
      21  Another delusion was that there was some involvement of his mother in the disappearance of the deceased. That emerged in answers the accused gave to the police and to others.  
         
      22  Thirdly, the accused believed that the deceased was watching him and plotting to kill him and perhaps he was paying neighbours to kill him. Aligned with that belief was the belief that his father was sometimes a clone and that the clone wanted to kill him.  
         
      23  These assertions of belief all come in one way or another from the accused himself, of course, and there is no evidence independent of what he has said by which the assertions may be tested.  
         
      24  Added to that, there is the fact that when interviewed by the police the accused made no statement apparently of psychotic origin, other perhaps, than his implication of his mother and her family. As well, explaining his denials in the interview with the interrogating police, he later gave a rational, not psychotic, reason, namely that he denied because he was in shock.  
         
      25  The late emergence of the claims of delusions, particularly of the belief that it was a clone of his father that he was killing, is also troublesome.  
         
      26  However, I think that the accused’s several accounts of these delusions bear a certain consistency among themselves, especially seen against the background of delusions from which he was undoubtedly suffering throughout 2002, 2003 and 2005. His psychotic state explains why he took so long to speak about his delusions.  
         
      27  I am satisfied by what he was reported to have said to the investigating police that he believed that he was in need of protection.  
         
      28  The acts of the accused in burying the body and denying knowledge of its existence or whereabouts, in setting fire to the bloodstained chair and in throwing away the bloodstained dinner plate as well as the knife show that he was aware that he had done something wrong. I am not prepared to accept that he believed that the accused had gone away, and his insistence on the increasingly preposterous story that the deceased had gone away several weeks earlier without his car, telephone or wallet may also be seen as evidence that he knew that he had done something wrong.  
         
      29  Even so, I do not think that his undoubted appreciation that he had done something wrong and faced trouble if the truth were found out prevents his proving that when he killed the deceased he was inhibited by his psychotic illness from reasoning with a moderate degree of calmness about the wrongness of his act. I am satisfied that whatever he did believe, he was a man beset with unreasonable fears. I think that he probably did believe that his father was involved in a conspiracy. I think that he probably did believe that he was in danger of violence from the neighbour and needed the protection he sought from the investigating police. I think that he probably did think that there was some kind of conspiracy in his mother’s family. I am satisfied that these beliefs all seriously affected his capacity to reason. I think that he was floridly psychotic when he killed the deceased, perhaps partly as a result of his return to the use of cannabis, as reported by the deceased.  
         
      30  In final addresses the Crown very properly submitted that the accused had made out the defence of mental illness.  
         
      31  I am satisfied that the accused has made out the defence. 
        
      32 The statute which governs cases like this requires me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice that will mean that the accused will be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1990 . A strict statutory regime will then come into effect. 
        
      33 The Mental Health Review Tribunal is a body of professional experts. Within 14 days after the verdict the Tribunal will commence a review of the case of the accused. When it has done its review the Tribunal will make a recommendation to the Minister for Health. That recommendation may be either unconditional or subject to conditions as to the manner in which the accused should be detained, cared for or treated. If the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release, it may make a recommendation as to his release. If it makes such a recommendation that will be considered by the Department of Health which in turn will advise the Governor-in-Council. The Governor-in-Council will then, in accordance with the recommendation and advice, either make an order for the detention of the accused or for his release, conditional or unconditional. The Governor-in-Council may only make an order for release where the Tribunal itself has recommended release. Assuming that no recommendation for release is made after the first hearing the Mental Health Review Tribunal can at any later time, and must at least once every six months, review the case of the accused.  
         
      34 After hearing the evidence at any later review, it must make a recommendation to the Minister for Health as to the continued detention, care or treatment of the accused or as to his release, conditional or unconditional. The Tribunal is not free at any such review to make a recommendation for release unless it is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. Again following such a review and recommendation the matter goes to the Department of Health and the Minister advises the Governor-in-Council. Any recommendation so advised can be carried into effect only by order of the Governor-in-Council.  
         
      35 If the accused were at any time released back into the community on conditions and there were a breach of any of those conditions, the Governor-in-Council might order that the accused be apprehended and detained. Such an order would follow by reason of the practical consideration that if a person were released, the Department of Health would maintain a watch over his case with the assistance of a Community Health Centre, a private psychiatrist, or one of the other public facilities available. In other words, if a person is released conditionally back into the community, then the Department maintains a watch over him and a breach of any condition will lead to his being apprehended and detained once again.  
         
      36 The conditions which could be applied include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication and so on, to ensure that the accused was properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions catering for forensic patients.  
         
      37 The only manner in which a person ceases to be a forensic patient for the purposes of these provisions is when he is unconditionally released by the Governor-in-Council, or is released upon conditions which include a condition as to the time that his release should become unconditional. If that time expires, then his release becomes unconditional and he ceases to be a forensic patient. However, as I previously explained, the accused will never be released unless the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered.  
      38 I find that the accused is not guilty of the murder of Mykalaj Charles Maciuk by reason of mental illness. I order that he be detained in the psychiatric ward of the hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre or at such other places as may be determined by the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law.

   JUDGMENTIntroduction1 Mark Joseph Smith (“the accused”) is to be arraigned by the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to three allegations of false swearing before the Police Integrity Commission. The offences were committed on 30 May and 8 August 2003.2 On or about 28 June 2007 an indictment was filed with this Court containing the three counts upon which the prosecution proposes to proceed against the accused. Before arraignment an issue has arisen as to the fitness of the accused to be tried. This Court has determined that an inquiry should be conducted before the hearing of the proceedings in respect of the offences pursuant to s 8 Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (‘the Act’). 3 That inquiry was conducted on Thursday 6 March 2008 pursuant to s.10 of the Act. The question of the accused’s fitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by a judge sitting alone and any determination of this Court must include the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact on which the judge relied (s.11). In determining this matter the Court has not been asked to consider s.10(4) of the Act. The inquiry was conducted in accordance with the requirements of s.12 of the Act.Principles to be Applied4 In R v Presser [1958] VR 45 Justice Smith (at 48), by reference to the relevant Victorian provision then in force said that the question to be determined as to whether a person was fit to plead (or now ‘to be tried’) was: 
     
      
      “Whether the accused because of a mental defect fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. …. he needs … to understand what he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel, he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.” 
      
    5 The so called “Presser test” was the “test” considered by each of the medical experts retained by the Crown and the defence in this matter. They identified seven common criteria to be considered when determining whether the accused’s condition(s) made him unfit to be tried.6 The “Presser test” was essentially confirmed by the High Court in Kesavarajah v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 230. The High Court said that the test to be applied was one that “looks to the capacity of the accused to understand the proceedings” but that the test did not mean that the accused was required “to have sufficient capacity to make an able defence” (see also Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 at 8). This was confirmed again in Eastman v The Queen (2000) 203 CLR 1 at [57] per Gaudron J. 7 The “Presser test” was reaffirmed as appropriate under New South Wales legislation in subsequent decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, such as R v Clarkson [2007] NSWCCA 70 and R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 (at [296] – [298]).8 In R v Drummond (New South Wales Court Criminal Appeal, 27 May 1994 unreported), the Court of Criminal Appeal, particularly in judgments of Gleeson CJ and Grove J, concluded that where an accused had “amnesia” of relevant events giving rise to, or related to, the charges to be brought against him or her, even where that amnesia arose from physical trauma to the brain, that person would not be unfit to be tried. The majority pointed out that an accused could lead evidence of an explanation for an absence of memory and an accused is not prevented from using information derived from secondary sources as he or his advisors think fit “in the course of the litigious contest”. Furthermore, there were warnings that a trial judge could give in favour of the accused. Gleeson CJ, in approving what was held in R v Dennison (New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, 3 March 1998, unreported) said that that decision was “supported by a line of English and Scottish authorities to the effect that amnesia does not constitute unfitness to plead to a criminal charge”. Specifically where a person suffers amnesia of relevant events, that does not mean that he or she is a person who is “incapable of letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is”, within the meaning of what Smith J. said in Presser (per Gleeson CJ at 10). Background Facts9 The accused was formerly a police officer. It is alleged against him that on three occasions when giving evidence before the Police Integrity Commission, in May and August 2003, he gave false evidence as particularised in the charges in the indictment. A person known as “Salmon”, a former New South Wales Police Officer, indicated to the New South Wales Crime Commission that he had information in relation to police corruption, some provided by the accused. The informant wore listening devices to meetings with the accused and legally obtained telephone interceptions were conducted on telephone services of the accused. Exhibit B sets out in some detail the material circumstances relating to the three charges and particularly the basis upon which it is alleged that the evidence given by the accused is false. Some of the evidence in the prosecution case is contained in recordings, either of the accused giving evidence or the accused recorded on listening device and telephone intercept tapes. A substantial part of the Crown case is dependant upon the truthfulness of evidence given by Salmon, particularly, of dealings he had with the accused over a period of time and with Andrew Rofe. The Medical Condition of the Accused10 Although three medical practitioners, Drs. Klug and Pickles, called by the accused’s counsel, and Professor Sachdev, produced by the prosecution, gave oral evidence before the Court, the inquiry had available to it a greater number of medical reports, including reports from other practitioners who were not called to give evidence. The most complete medical history of the accused appears in the report of Professor Sachdev of 10 June 2006, although I note other matters of medical history are provided from the treating doctor, Dr Pickles, and Dr Teychenné a consultant neurologist. Doctor Sachdev is a Professor of Neuropsychiatry for the School of Psychiatry, at the University of New South Wales. 11 In 1993 the accused suffered a head injury in a pool and a CT brain scan suggested that he had an arterio-venous malformation (AVM) in his brain. As it was asymptomatic no action was taken. On 22 September 1998 he had a seizure while driving and he was found to have a four centimetre AVM in the left temporal lobe. The accused underwent a resection of the AVM on 5 November 2004, as a result of which he developed aphasia (language problems), headache and right side tingling. He was then found to have a large haemorrhage in the upper part of the left temporal lobe. A craniotomy was “reopened” and a small amount of brain tissue overlying a haematoma was removed and the haematoma was evacuated with some residual AVM excised. In the course of recovery there was a fear that he may develop receptive dysphasia, that is an inability to understand or produce spoken language. He did not develop any significant speech problems and no detectable errors in language were noted in observations. He reported in January 2005 that under stress he had some difficulty retrieving the occasional word, however otherwise he had no visual impairment or other neurological deficits. There was concern that under stress there may be some difficulties. 12 After discharge from hospital the accused started to suffer epileptic seizures, although he was taking the anti epileptic drug Dilantin. He has had multiple episodes up until the present time and has had episodes of inability to speak and right sided weakness on a regular basis. These episodes are regarded as “focal seizures” which may be partially controlled by medication. I note that the accused was assaulted in November 2005, loosing consciousness, but this did not significantly change his symptoms. In June 2007 another AVM recurred and this was removed by surgery at that time.13 Since that time the accused has continued to suffer epileptic seizures, not withstanding the use of anti epileptic medication, and has developed what has been diagnosed as a major depression and severe anxiety symptoms. He has been treated with anti depressants and psychotherapy. He also takes medication to sleep at night in addition to his anti epileptic medication. 14 The main evidence of neuropsychological testing is reported by Professor Sachdev and Dr Teychenné. Dr Teychenné also reviewed reports of treating Doctors Pickles and Cremer. Generally speaking the neuropsychological testing of Dr Miller on 8 May 2006 reported that Mr Smith felt that his word finding, reading and memory skills were impaired. Professor Sachdev in his report noted that there were “no word finding difficulties noted by the tester”, the accused performed in the average range of intellectual functioning, had a normal span of attention and a good ability to solve problems “in a flexible” manner” but his memory test showed a variable performance. While he performed poorly on the task of remembering a word list he could remember “stories”, within the normal range. He did well on a test of prospective memory, that is “remembering to remember”. His word finding abilities were impaired and he was rated as “severe” on scales of depression, stress and anxiety. Sachdev conducted his own ‘shorthand’ psychometric or neuropsychological testing. Sachdev undertook several “mini mental” tests and assessed the accused’s performance as showing no gross impairment. He scored 30/30 on the ‘mini-mental tests’. 15 When Professor Sachdev tested the accused for a second time in November 2007, about seventeen months after first seeing him, he noted that the accused’s history of himself was largely unchanged except for a worsening of his epilepsy condition. He claimed a worsening of cognitive deficits since the surgery of 2007, stating that his memory was poorer. He claimed difficulty with comprehending discussions with his legal team, with a need for material to be explained to him on a “one to one basis”. He said he had difficulty comprehending papers that were forwarded to him and other problems of a cognitive nature. He told Professor Sachdev in November 2007 that he could not remember the details of the testimony he gave to the Police Integrity Commission, although he remembered people associated with that investigation including the man ‘Salmon’ but could not remember the circumstances in which allegations made by Salmon to him in respect of obtaining a false passport and possessing a police badge had occurred. He also reported significant increase in mood disturbance. 16 Dr Teychenné agreed with the assessment of Dr Miller that there was dysfunction within the left fronto-temporal region, with possible “kindling” in the right temporal lobe as a result of epileptic pathology. There was consequent memory loss or “disturbance”. He would not exclude memory loss prior to surgery because of temporal lobe pathology and psychological factors. He believed that the patient could not instruct counsel or give his version of events because of memory loss.The Oral Evidence17 From the evidence of Dr Klug and Dr Pickles and their reports, which it must be said are more limited than Professor Sachdev’s in respect of the key issues for determination in this inquiry, I accept that the accused has been receiving intensive treatment for the symptoms of major depression, anxiety and his epilepsy. Although Dr Pickles as his treating doctor clearly has a genuine concern for his welfare, she was unfortunately the least dispassionate of the witnesses and the less reliable because of that. Many of her concerns are irrelevant to this inquiry. There was nothing sinister in her approach, but the matter cannot be judged by emotion, without regard to all the facts. In fact she, like Dr Klug, had little detail of relevant matters to the litigation in order to be able to properly form opinions about matters germane to the determination of this injury. 18 Dr Pickles in her report and in her oral evidence asserts that Mr Smith did not satisfy any of the criteria set down in the “Presser test”. This cannot be accepted on an objective analysis for the evidence. Dr Klug, who was an impressive witness, so far as his evidence went, was of the view that in two respects the accused was not fit to be tried, either because he was unable to follow the course of the proceedings and/or because he was unable to assist in his defence by instructing counsel.19 In relation to the first matter he noted the accused suffered from an “adjustment disorder”, connected to his depressive illness. Further, with three major neurological interventions and damage from epileptic seizures, as well as the ingestion of many psychotropic drugs, there was interference with his concentration and memory. These problems made it difficult for him to collate information, particularly because of his inability to concentrate. He conceded that if a person was available to assist him to “translate matters in court” this may be of assistance but that the impending trial and the trial itself would create stressors on a day to day basis which would affect his health, cause on going seizures and exacerbate his depressive symptoms. He claimed that the accused could reach a point of panic where he may wish to flee the situation. He said that the accused’s lack of memory would make it difficult for him to “assist in his defence by instructing counsel”, as would his diminished concentration. I took this to also affect his ability to give his version of events, largely through his lack of memory.20 He conceded that the accused could communicate to another person advancing symptoms consistent with heightened anxiety, but he may “freeze” If he “panicked”, this would interfere with his thought processes. It must be noted that whilst Dr Klug saw him on two occasions, he was not assessing the accused for medico-legal purposes and was not fully aware of the details of the charges. Nor had he sought any information from the accused about the detail of the evidence such as he could remember it. He conceded the accused would have no difficulty listening to recordings of his own voice and the voices of other people germane to the case. Ultimately, he was of the opinion that the critical inhibition upon the accused was his memory and a diminution of concentration, affecting his ability to process information but that he could be assisted in these areas. 21 Professor Sachdev was of the view that the accused satisfied all the relevant “Presser” criteria to be fit to be tried, although he conceded that the accused had cognitive deficits, had perhaps substantial or significant medical and mental illness problems and was susceptible to both epileptic episodes and depressive symptoms. 22 He also conceded that the accused may need extra time in order to collate or digest information but that generally speaking the accused was able to comprehend and follow both oral and written instructions. He did not suffer gross aphasia but had no memory of the relevant events giving rise to the charges. He noted that the accused recognised and knew the name of the police informant and the second man involved, Andrew Rofe, he recognised and understood the charge brought against him, he had memory and knowledge of the man Salmon being accused of dealing in drugs and some other surrounding facts. The doctor conceded also that he did not know whether this was “real memory” or “learnt memory”. He was unable to say whether the memory held by the accused was relevantly “independent”. 23 Professor Sachdev believed that the accused had the capacity to remember, or recollect, evidence being given and recordings being played, although some details may escape him. He may need extra time, or may need to sit “one to one” with a person from time to time to assist him to follow the information being provided in court. This person was referred to in passing as a “logical translator” (as I understood it without a transcript) but he did not believe the accused needed a “logical translator” all the time. Such difficulty as the accused had in collating information could be overcome with assistance. 24 However, whilst he may need assistance in the processing of information, he would not have trouble of a major type in logical thought processes and making logical deductions. He accepted that stress and anxiety from the build up to the trial and the conduct of the trial could cause a quantative change to his ability to understand and process information, but not a qualitative change. He accepted that an adjustment disorder, which involves acute symptomology when stressed, may affect the accused’s capacities but believed that his symptoms could be monitored during the trial by those dealing with him, or from time to time by those treating him.25 In his evidence and his report Dr Sachdev noted that Dr Miller’s testing showed that in memorising a list of words the accused’s performance was below average however, on logical memory and prospective memory tests he was within the “normal band” or was “average”. Submissions26 Both the Crown and the accused, by reference to the character of the reports tendered, broke the “Presser criteria” down to seven issues. Each of the reports tendered addressed each of these issues in the same general order.27 Learned Senior Counsel for the prosecution submitted Dr Pickles was not objective and did not give compelling evidence. Dr Klug she said was obliged to defer to the greater “technical” knowledge of relevant matters of Professor Sachdev who was the most compelling witness. She pointed out that ultimately all the doctors (with the exception of Pickles) gave either a positive response or a qualified positive response, to the capacity of the accused to satisfy the seven relevant criteria. She conceded that stress may affect his efficiency in processing information. Although there will be difficulties, extra assistance may be required for the accused during any trial and he may need to be given time in the conduct of the trial, all of these matters could be accommodated. If so, any trial conducted would not then be unfair. Ultimately, on the balance of probabilities, the Court should conclude that the accused is fit to be tried. She noted that the trial process was not an exercise in “perfection”, the accused could instruct his counsel, there was absolutely no evidence produced that he was unable to communicate instructions to his counsel or understand what was occurring and the like. She said in her submissions that it was significant that there was no evidence from his solicitor, as was often the case in such matters, pointing to the inability of the accused to communicate or convey instructions.28 Mr Hood, learned counsel for the accused, conceded in his submissions that the matter rested on the fourth and sixth “Presser” criteria as identified by Dr Klug. The “seventh” criterion has a logical connection to the sixth. He submitted skilfully that the accused could not follow or understand the proceedings. Even Sachdev, he submitted, pointed to the need for a “logical translator”. As to his ability to assist his defence by instructing counsel, he submitted that the accused was not in a position to recognise any deficiency had may be having in identifying matters upon which he needed to give his counsel instruction as he had difficulty collating and processing information. It was submitted that stressors, such as the trial process, would affect the accused’s concentration and his ability to understand what was going on. His lack of memory of relevant events reflected upon his inability to give a version of events. He would not have the capacity to undertake the extensive note taking which would enable him to remember what was occurring in court or to process what was occurring in court.29 The Crown in reply particularly referred to the assessment of Dr Miller from May 2006 which pointed to a normal span of attention and a good ability to solve problems in a flexible manner. Whilst his memory had shown variable performance, it was not entirely deficient in remembering immediate past events.Consideration30 The most impressive witness in giving evidence on the critical matters for determination was Professor Sachdev. His written reports were logical and persuasive. He gave the impression of making a dispassionate assessment, with a thorough knowledge of the background of the accused’s medical condition and, particularly, a thorough knowledge of relevant neuropsychological testing, which in the context of details of the relevant medical history would appear to be the most reliable guide to an assessment of the true cognitive abilities of the accused. 31 In assessing Professor Sachdev’s opinions I have not completely ignored some of the observations of Dr Pickles, particularly as to the character of the illnesses and medical conditions from which the accused suffers and the capacity for matters to trigger symptoms of his illnesses. I note her opinions about his difficulties in processing information and his need to write down things in order to assist him to collate or process information. Dr Klug expressed similar opinions. She was of the view that generally speaking his inability to collate information or process information made him unable to meet any of the criteria, as I earlier observed. But, as his counsel realistically noted in his submissions, that could not be claimed in relation to the accused’s ability to understand what he is charged with, to enter a plea to the relevant charges, to understand the nature of the proceedings, to understand the substantial effect of the evidence against him or for that matter in providing his version of the facts, such as he can with an absence of memory of relevant events.32 Professor Sachdev had some qualifications so far as the capacity of the accused to follow the course of the proceedings and noted the limitation in his ability to assist in his defence by instructing counsel. This last matter included his inability to recall the evidence he gave before the Police Integrity Commission and the events preceding and following the hearing. 33 One of the features of Dr Klug’s opinions was that, whilst he foresaw problems in concentration and processing of information as potential problems, ultimately his assessment of that situation was primarily speculative. He did express his opinions in probabilities but lacked empirical data or evidence to support his speculations. In any event, he identified strategies for the conduct of the proceedings which could provide relevant fairness to the accused. Neither he, nor Dr Pickles, had undertaken any psychometric or other testing themselves to quantify potential cognitive deficit, or even present cognitive deficit. In fact their assessment of his deficits, giving rise to identification of relevant “Presser” criteria, does not, in my opinion, give full regard to the neuropsychological evidence referred to in the reports of Drs Teychenné and Sachdev or to be found elsewhere. Ultimately, Dr Teychenné’s assessment of failure to meet “Presser” criteria turned upon absence of memory. Dr Klug took into account other factors, such as shortcomings in concentration and the effects of stressors, but his view that these make the accused unfit to be tried is not sustainable and was itself qualified by concessions he made as to strategies to overcome unfairness.34 The evidence is quite clear that the accused understands what the charges are, is able to enter a plea to the charges and generally understands the nature of the proceedings brought against him. Such inability as is claimed for him not to follow the course of the proceedings boils down to matters that concern themselves with the “speed” or “rate” at which the accused might process information provided to the court and the need from time to time for the accused to receive “one on one” translation of matters occurring in court. On the other hand the accused’s logical reasoning processes are within normal range. It is obvious that procedures could be undertaken in the course of a trial to provide some assistance to the accused which would not necessarily bog the trial down in disruptive delay. The accused understands the substantial effect of the evidence to be given against him and, in the context of what was discussed in Drummond by Grove J (at p.8), is able to assist in his defence by instructing counsel, in the pure sense, even if he may be unable to instruct his counsel because he has no memory of relevant events. Likewise, he is able to provide his version of events, in the manner discussed in Drummond by Gleeson CJ (at 9-10), notwithstanding a lack of memory of relevant events. Ultimately it is a claimed absence of memory that underpins a claim of unfitness to be tried and that, without more, is not sufficient to justify the finding of “unfitness”. Whilst there is an inexorable logic to the reasoning in Drummond, and I am bound to accept its ratio, I wonder how the test of fairness, central to Presser, and identified in recent High Court decisions previously quoted, can be accorded to an accused whose loss of memory is by reason of organic or pathologically proven brain damage, or trauma, occurring subsequent to relevant events rather than “forgetfulness” or excessive alcohol consumption. The observations of the learned Chief Justice of reduction of court delay by such a strategy denies the ability of Courts to identify genuine or ‘legitimate’ bases for considering “Presser” criteria in order to address their real purpose. It would not be much of a trial if a brain damaged person cannot develop instructions or a version from secondary sources.35 There is no evidence of an inability to communicate with, and understand advice from, his legal advisors. The analysis of learned Senior Counsel for the Crown, Ms Robinson QC, of the weight of opinion from all experts, except Dr Pickles, supporting satisfaction of “Presser” criteria, is sound. It must be fairly said that the various conditions that the accused suffers from may excite sympathy, notwithstanding the character of the charges brought against him. Whatever be the character of his conduct giving rise to the charges the accused clearly is now burdened with conditions that will remain with him all of his life and create perils for him in the future in a range of ways. But, the appropriateness of him being tried, or the appropriateness of any punishment for him if convicted, are matters for consideration by both the prosecuting authorities and the Court required to adjudicate such matters. His conditions do not render him unfit to be tried.Conclusion36 I conclude that the evidence establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that the accused is fit to be tried. All the criteria identified in the ‘Presser test’ are satisfied. However, any proceedings relating to the prosecution of the accused will need to provide opportunity for the accused, during the hearing, to obtain ‘one on one’ assistance to follow the proceedings from time to time and there will need to be suitable breaks and adjournments to assist the accused to digest, collate or synthesise the evidence given in the trial. As the learned Crown Prosecutor pointed out, if an acute episode caused by stress or anxiety occurred, such as to interfere with the accused’s understanding of proceedings, applications would need to be made and entertained by the Court with control of the proceedings for appropriate steps to be taken to provide the accused with professional assistance and treatment or to further consider his continuing fitness, or unfitness, to be tried.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J:  I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    3 FULLERTON J: The applicant, Jason Robert Shaw, seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed by his Honour Acting Judge Woods QC at Dubbo on 17 May 2007 after pleas of guilty were entered to one count of aggravated break, enter and the commission of a serious indictable offence (here the infliction of actual bodily harm) contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of malicious damage to property (here damage to the residence of the premises that were broken into and entered) contrary to s 195(a) of the Crimes Act committed on 26 September 2006.  
     
      
    4 The maximum penalty for an offence under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for a period of 20 years with a standard non-parole period of five years applying under s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The maximum penalty for the offence of malicious damage is imprisonment for five years.  
     
      
    5 In respect of the offence of break and enter in circumstances of aggravation, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years backdated to commence on 7 April 2007 to account for some broken periods of pre-sentence custody. It would appear that the applicant was released on conditional bail on the day of his arrest but either that day, or shortly thereafter, an Apprehended Violence Order was taken out for the protection of the victim of the assault. On 19 December 2006, the applicant’s bail was revoked because of a breach of the Apprehended Violence Order and he thereafter remained in custody until 25 January 2007 when he was again released to bail. 
     
      
    6 The non-parole period of four years was imposed against a total term of imprisonment of six years fixed to expire on 6 April 2013. Despite the fact that his Honour made no finding of special circumstances, the sentence was structured so as to disturb the ratio between non-parole period and total term as provided for in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act by a measure of months.  
     
      
    7 A concurrent fixed term of three months was imposed in respect of the offence of malicious damage. No submissions were directed to the sentence imposed for this offence. On any view it was a related and secondary offence and one that properly resulted in a concurrent term of imprisonment.  
     
      
    8 The grounds of appeal as set out in the applicant’s written submissions are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentence was not proportionate to the objective circumstances of the offence;  
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in his application of Div 1A of Part IV of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        (ss 54A – 54D);  
         
         
        3. In imposing the sentence, his Honour failed to have proper regard to the subjective matters raised. In particular, his Honour erred: 
         
          
          (i) in the manner in which he took account of the applicant’s guilty plea;  
           
          (ii) by giving insufficient weight to the plea of guilty, the applicant’s remorse, reparation and his prospects of rehabilitation;  
          
         
        (iii) in holding that the offence constituted an abuse of trust;  
         
          
          (iv) by punishing the applicant for an apparent propensity to harassment in domestic situations;  
           
          (v) by not having proper regard to provocation offered by the victim in accordance with s 21A(3)(c) of the  
          Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
          ; and  
          
         
         
        4. His Honour erred in his approach to s 44(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        . 
        
       
       
      The facts upon which sentence was passed 
       
      
    9 An agreed statement of facts signed by the applicant was tendered on sentence together with a record of interview in which he participated consequent upon his arrest. A statement taken on the day of the incident from the victim, Ms Pahl, the applicant’s former partner, was also tendered together with a statutory declaration signed by her and prepared some short time before the sentence proceedings. In the statutory declaration Ms Pahl sought to explain the circumstances in which the offences were committed and to take some responsibility for what she considered to be her part in provoking the applicant to act as he did but from a perspective different to that detailed in her statement to police. 
     
      
    10 The applicant gave evidence in the sentence proceedings where he also sought to put in issue the context in which the assault against Ms Pahl was perpetrated and the circumstances in which she sustained her injuries as detailed in the agreed statement of facts. His evidence was consistent with Ms Pahl’s statutory declaration but inconsistent with her statement to police and inconsistent in some respects with his record of interview. It is patent from his Honour’s reasons for sentence that he rejected the applicant’s evidence and proceeded to sentence on the basis of the agreed facts. 11 Those facts are as follows. The applicant and Ms Pahl were partners in a domestic relationship for approximately five years prior to the incident. It appeared that they did not reside together consistently throughout that period as the applicant worked in the mining industry in Western Australia for discrete periods. They had a son who was at the time of the offence three years old. Ms Pahl had eight-year-old twin daughters from a previous relationship. All three children resided with the applicant and Ms Pahl until their separation on 21 September 2006, five days before the commission of the offence.  
     
      
    12 On that day, Ms Pahl left the residence, jointly occupied by herself and the applicant, after a domestic dispute. She took the three children with her and sought accommodation at the residence of a friend, Ms Casey Ryan. It was Ms Ryan’s premises that were broken into and entered and in which Ms Pahl was assaulted on 26 September. It would appear that the applicant knew where Ms Pahl and the children were living and had made threats to her physical safety by telephone in the days leading up to the incident. It also appeared that the conversations by telephone concerned the applicant’s desire for contact with his son, in particular on his son’s third birthday on 24 September 2006. 
     
      
    13 While the applicant had been promised access to his son for his birthday, contact on that day was refused because the child was ill with a virus. The applicant was informed by Ms Pahl of the reasons why she was refusing him contact with his son and in the course of a heated telephone conversation he said: “I’ll come around there and kick your fuck’n door in, and there’s no way you can stop me from seeing him”. I note that on the following day, 25 September 2006, the applicant was informed that his son had in fact been ill. Nevertheless, he remained upset at having not seen his child on his birthday. 
     
      
    14 There was no contact between the parties on 25 September 2006. That evening the applicant consumed a not insignificant quantity of alcohol at a local hotel before leaving around midnight. He said that he spent the remainder of the night drinking alone and ruminating over the fact that he had been denied access to his son the previous day. According to the account he gave to police and their own observations, he was drunk the following morning when, at about 6am, he went to Ms Ryan’s home with the intention of seeing his son. Present inside the house at the time that the applicant arrived were Ms Pahl, her son, and the twin girls as well as Ms Ryan and her six children aged between eight years and eleven months.  
     
      
    15 The applicant demanded entry to the house to see his son by kicking the front door twice and, when entry was refused, he used a small hammer or pick that he located in the garage to smash a hole through the front door with a view to opening the door from the inside. Ms Pahl and Ms Ryan told the applicant to leave. Ms Ryan telephoned the police. The applicant was unable to unlock the front door as he could not reach the door handle. He then smashed two of the adjacent windows with the hammer. It appeared that he could see that the rear door of the premises was open through the hole created in the front door. By the time he reached the rear door, however, the door was closed. The applicant then smashed a window at the rear of the house and damaged a flywire screen before striking the rear door and jarring it open. He then entered the house. 
     
      
    16 The applicant still had the hammer in his left hand as he approached Ms Pahl who was in the hallway. He grabbed her by the hair and punched her with his right fist to her left shoulder. The applicant’s son was nearby. The applicant then struck Ms Pahl with a clenched right fist to the area just above her left eye knocking her to the ground. It was this injury that resulted in what was described as a small cut to the left eyebrow region which later required suturing. The applicant punched the victim in the head a total of three or four times. Whilst this was taking place, Ms Ryan and her small baby and the other children, with the exception of the applicant’s son, left the house via the back door.  
     
      
    17 The applicant picked up his son and walked out through the back door. Ms Pahl pursued him and tried to stop him leaving with the child. She was knocked to the ground and when on the ground she was kicked to the head. The applicant took his son to the gutter in front of the house and sat down. 
     
      
    18 He remained with the child until the police arrived after which he was arrested and taken to the police station. He did not in any way seek to resist arrest. He repeated several times to attending police, “I just can’t believe I did that to her”. In the record of interview, he told police that as he was walking to Ms Ryan’s home his intentions were to see his son and that when he was refused entry to the premises he lost control and forced entry in the manner described. While he openly conceded that he had an expectation that there would be conflict between himself and the victim, he claimed that he did not go to Ms Ryan’s premises with the intention of inflicting actual bodily harm upon her. He said to police that he felt like a “fucking gutless coward nonetheless”. 
     
      
    19 Ms Pahl was conveyed to hospital where various areas of swelling, bruising and abrasion to her body were noted together with the laceration earlier referred to. She was then transferred to the Dubbo Base Hospital for further management.  
     
      
       
      The applicant’s criminal record  
       
      
    20 The applicant’s history of offending against the law in New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria was before the sentencing judge. It included various breaches of restraining orders and two charges of assault, the most recent of which involved Ms Pahl, and in respect of which he was placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for 12 months.  
     
      
    21 While it would appear that these incidents did not involve actual violence, the applicant’s criminal record was ample evidence of his propensity to harassment in domestic situations and his failure to manage his anger in the past. These observations were made by his Honour in the context of considering and contrasting the high regard in which he was held by others as reflected in the various testimonials that were tendered on his behalf. His Honour also made reference to his past offending in a domestic context when coming to the view that a term of imprisonment was the only appropriate sentencing outcome. Later in his reasons for sentence, his Honour made it clear that he proposed to take this same conduct into account when considering whether leniency could be afforded the applicant in circumstances where he had not previously been sentenced to a period of imprisonment, but that he would ignore it when assessing the objective seriousness of the offending for which the applicant was to be sentenced. There is no error in that approach. It is consistent with the use that might legitimately be made of an offender’s prior record (see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566). Accordingly, the submission that his Honour punished the applicant for an apparent propensity to harassment in domestic situations, contrary to Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, must be rejected.  
     
      
       
      The applicant’s subjective circumstances  
       
      
    22 The applicant was 38 years of age at the time of sentence. He was in full-time work in the mining industry and had worked in that industry for many years in various parts of Australia. The testimonials tendered on his behalf attested to his expertise and his value as a reliable and stable worker in a highly skilled area where level headedness is essential to ensure the safety of others involved in the mining operations. In the view of Mr Glover, a mine foreman under whose direct authority the applicant had been working for 18 months at the time of sentence, the applicant was a man who was good-natured and easygoing and who, in spite of his size, was neither overtly violent nor prone to outbursts of aggressive behavior whether in the workplace or when socialising. He regarded the violence perpetrated upon the applicant’s partner as out of character. He knew the applicant to be a devoted and loving father and understood the offence to have occurred in the context of a fractious domestic situation in circumstances where he had been denied access to his son.  
     
      
    23 It was submitted that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances inclusive of his plea of guilty, his remorse and reparation and to his prospects of rehabilitation. As a general proposition, it is clear from the remarks on sentence that his Honour was not overly impressed by the applicant’s subjective circumstances given his past offending, and that the fact that the circumstances in which he re-offended reflected a failure on his part to address a tendency to a loss of self-control. Although his Honour referred to the fact that rehabilitation was a factor to be taken into account on sentence, he made no assessment of the applicant’s prospects in that regard despite the applicant’s evidence that he had abided by a bail condition that he abstain from drinking, his preparedness to continue with the counselling he had undertaken following his arrest and the considerable support and guidance he was offered by friends and work colleagues.  
     
      
    24 On the other hand, his Honour apparently accepted as genuine the shame and remorse the applicant expressed upon arrest (and which he repeated in his evidence) and that this was consistent with the attitude to his offending as he expressed it to others. His Honour cited the applicant’s remorse and the plea of guilty as mitigating factors under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but considered that despite the fact that these considerations attracted some leniency they were outweighed by the level of objective seriousness inherent in the offence and the circumstances of its commission, particularly where young children were present. His Honour also regarded the applicant’s remorse as outweighed by the need for general deterrence. I can detect no error in that approach. This Court has made it abundantly clear that in sentencing for domestic violence offences specific and general deterrence assume a particular importance as does the necessity that the sentence imposed be both protective of the community and a powerful denunciation by it of the offender’s conduct (see R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 at [65]-[88]).  
     
      
    25 The applicant also submitted that his Honour erred in the manner in which he took account of the applicant’s plea of guilty. I will consider that submission later in this judgment since I am of the view that error of this kind has been demonstrated and, for that reason, that this Court should re-sentence the applicant. 
     
      
      The significance of Ms Pahl’s conduct  
       
      
    26 The applicant submitted that his Honour should have taken into account Ms Pahl’s conduct as amounting to provocation in accordance with s 21A(3)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The difficulty that the applicant faces in making good that submission is that his Honour rejected those aspects of the applicant’s evidence and Ms Pahl’s statutory declaration that contradicted the agreed statement of facts. Since it was only in this material that there is any suggestion of Ms Pahl taunting the applicant and laughing at him through the closed door of Ms Ryan’s house on the day of the offence such as may amount to conduct provoking the offence, there was no evidence upon which to find provocation on this or any other basis however reliable that version of events might be. While there was evidence before his Honour of relationship tension and general enmity between the applicant and Ms Pahl leading up to the offence, and while this was part of the overall circumstances in which the offending occurred, it did not constitute evidence of provocation such as to amount to mitigation.  
     
      
    27 It would also appear that his Honour did not consider the improvement in the relationship between the applicant and Ms Pahl to the point where they were reconciled at the time of sentence as weighing heavily in the applicant’s favour. His Honour was clearly cautious before giving any weight to those aspects of Ms Pahl’s statutory declaration where she addressed her own responsibility for the deterioration in the relationship, her desire to withdraw her statement to police and her desire for her family to be reunited. This was an approach open to his Honour since it is the collected experience of sentencing courts that victims of domestic violence may be actively pressured to forgive their assailants or compelled for other reasons to show a preparedness to forgive them. In R v Glen (Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 December 1994, unreported), Simpson J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, exceptional caution should be exercised in the receipt, and the use, of evidence of that kind [general evidence of of forgiveness and desire that the assailant/ partner not be imprisoned] in cases that fall within the general description of domestic violence offences, of which this case is one. It is a fact known to the courts and to the community that victims of domestic violence frequently, and clearly contrary to their own interests and welfare, forgive their attackers. It is said, and has been said so often and for so long as to be almost notorious, that it was this pattern of post offence forgiveness, accompanied by apparent remorse or contrition on the part of the offender, that prevented the prosecution of such offenders. In turn, it appeared that the victim of domestic violence was in a class different to the rest of the community insofar as the protection of the law was concerned. Domestic violence was not seen as a crime which attracted the sanction of the law in the same way or to the same extent as other crimes, whether or not of violence. The perpetrator of domestic violence was relatively safe to commit crimes with impunity, at least provided he or she (and, in the cases that have to date come before the courts, it has almost invariably been he) could attain the victim's forgiveness.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There are two main arguments of principle against the proposition that this Court should give any weight to the expressed wish of the victim in this case that the applicant not be incarcerated. The first concerns the importance, especially great in cases of domestic violence, given the history that I have alluded to, of general deterrence. This Court must send a signal to domestic violence offenders that, regardless of self interest denying forgiveness on the part of victims, those victims will nevertheless receive the full protection of the law, insofar as the courts are able to afford it to them. It must not be forgotten, that, if it is to be accorded weight by the courts, forgiveness by the victim also operates contrary to the interests of other victims. Until it is recognised that domestic violence will be treated with severe penalties regardless of a later softening of attitude by the victim, no progress is likely to be made in its abolition or reduction. Put simply, the importance of general deterrence in such cases overrides any minor relevance that evidence of forgiveness might have.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        For too long the community in general and the agencies of law enforcement in particular, have turned their backs upon the helpless victims of domestic violence. Acceptance of the victim's word that he/she forgives the offender, casts too great a burden of responsibility upon one individual already in a vulnerable position. Neither the community, the law enforcement agencies, nor the courts can be permitted to abdicate their responsibility in this fashion. Protection of the particular victim in the particular case is a step towards protection of other victims in other cases…” 
        
       
      
    28 Ms Pahl did not give evidence in the sentence proceedings. She did, however, swear an affidavit upon which the applicant seeks to rely should this Court uphold the appeal and re-sentence.  
     
      
       
      Objective seriousness and proportionality  
       
      
    29 On any view of the evidence, it would appear that the offences were committed after the applicant, having been denied a visit to his son on his son’s birthday three days earlier, was refused entry to Ms Ryan’s home. Although his Honour did not say so expressly, given the concession by the Crown that the offence was neither planned nor premeditated, he could not have proceeded to sentence other than on the basis that the applicant did not go to Ms Ryan’s home with the intention of breaking his way in so as to see his son, or of assaulting Ms Pahl if she refused him access to his son. Despite the absence of premeditation, his Honour regarded the offending as “high in the level of seriousness under the section” because of the fact that children were in the house and that actual bodily harm was inflicted. His Honour considered that this would warrant what he described as “the starting point for any sentence in an area of 10 years”.  
     
      
    30 The applicant conceded that the offence was objectively serious but submitted that the sentence was disproportionate to the gravity of the offending. The applicant also submitted that his Honour erred in his application of Div 1A of Part IV of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (ss 54A – 54D) in that he did not undertake in any meaningful way the task identified in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 and R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575. This error in approach is said to have resulted in a sentence that was excessive. 
     
      
    31 The common law principle of proportionality requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime having regard to the objective circumstances (see Hoare v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 348 at 354). In McNaughton, the Chief Justice noted that in a line of cases commencing with R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354, referred to and affirmed by a five judge bench in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252 at [156]-[158], the proportionality principle is also held to apply so that a sentence should not be less than that which the objective gravity of the offence requires.  
     
      
    32 In this case, his Honour was obliged to assess the objective seriousness of the offending not simply in order to arrive at a sentence proportionate to the gravity of the offending but also because the sentence for a breach of s 112(2) of the Crimes Act, which attracts a standard non-parole period of five years, fell to be determined by reference to s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in the way in which this Court has stipulated in R v Way. In the case of a plea of guilty, it is appropriate for a sentencing judge to consider where the particular offence lies on the range of objective seriousness (see R v Porteous [2005] NSWCCA 115 at [22]; R v Tory [2006] NSWCCA 18 at [14]) although the fact that a plea of guilty was entered is irrelevant to the determination of the place occupied by the offence on the range of objective seriousness (see R v Rice [2004] NSWCCA 384; 150 A Crim R 37 at 56).  
     
      
    33 Not only did his Honour fail to make any reference at all to what might constitute offending in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind such as would enable a meaningful comparison to be made between the applicant’s offending and that for which the standard non-parole period is prescribed before taking into account subjective matters, I am not satisfied that his Honour’s twofold reason for categorising the offending as “high in the level of seriousness under the section” was justified. Being an element of the offence, the infliction of actual bodily harm was not available as a feature of aggravation (see s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). In addition, it is unclear whether the fact that young children were in the house at the time of the offence was regarded by his Honour as a matter of aggravation under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or otherwise. In another part of the judgment his Honour also regarded the applicant’s violence towards his partner as constituting a breach of trust which his Honour regarded as an aggravating factor.  
     
      
    Matters of aggravation  
     
      
    34 Neither on sentence nor on the appeal did the Crown submit that the presence of the children per se was an aggravating feature. On the appeal, however, the Crown did seek to rely upon s 21A(2)(g) and (l) as aggravating features.  
     
      
    35 As to s 21A(2)(g), the Crown submitted that the injury, emotional harm and damage caused by the offence was substantial. His Honour made no such finding. Moreover, in the absence of evidence bearing upon the issue of substantial harm independent of the elements of the offence, I do not regard it as matter open to be considered as aggravating the offence.  
     
      
    36 As to s 21A(2)(l), the Crown submitted that since the offence was an offence of domestic violence and Ms Pahl was the female partner she was in a position of vulnerability relative to the applicant. In addition, the Crown submitted that he had breached a position of trust relative to her as provided for in s 21A(2)(k). While as a matter of principle these are frequently matters to which particular emphasis is given in the context of sentencing for domestic violence offences (see R v Glen, and R v Devine, Supreme Court of Tasmania, Underwood J, 5 July 1993 unreported, both cases referred to by Johnson J in Hamid) these matters do not in my view elevate the applicant’s offending to a level which is objectively high. Were the applicant to have planned a forced entry, armed himself for that purpose, and then used the tool as a weapon to inflict injury, the offence would properly be categorized in that way (see for example R v Davies [2004] NSWCCA 319 at [34]). While his Honour was justifiably critical of the applicant going to Ms Ryan’s home at all when he was well affected by alcohol, and equally as critical of his loss of control when access to his son was refused, I am not satisfied that these features are such as to appoint the offence as within “a high level of seriousness”. That said, the fact that the applicant went to a family home where his partner and son were temporarily residing, forced entry by the use of a tool that was not abandoned upon entry even if it was not wielded as a weapon, and then attacked the mother of his son in the presence of the child and other young children, were properly matters to be taken into account when assessing the level of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    37 In my view, the offending, while objectively serious, is more accurately described as in the middle of the range of offending of its kind. I note that this was the position articulated by the Crown on sentence. I have come to that view by reference to the schedule of cases Mr Haesler SC attached to his submissions and by the observations of Johnson J in Lovell v R; Dominey v R [2006] NSWCCA 222 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[63] The type of conduct which may constitute a s.112(2) offence encompasses a wide range of activities. Examples may be seen in a number of decisions of this Court. There have been cases where s.112(2) offences have involved the breaking and entry by an offender or offenders into premises and the commission of a serious indictable offence of violence against a victim following an incident which has provoked such a response. These s.112(2) offences have involved acts motivated by revenge or retribution or by a desire to teach the victim a lesson or to warn him off. An act of retaliation by an offender against a person who had assaulted the offender's father was characterised as being significantly below the mid-range of objective seriousness in  
        R v Price  
        [2005] NSWCCA 285 at paragraph 23. Where an offender broke and entered premises and then assaulted the victim whom the offender believed had earlier assaulted the offender's daughter, it was accepted that the offence lay at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness:  
        R v Millar  
        [2005] NSWCCA 202 at paragraph 43. Where two offenders broke and entered premises and assaulted persons in the belief that one of the victims had made an improper approach to their 14-year old sister, it was concluded that the conduct was significantly less than the middle of the range of objective seriousness:  
        R v Tory 
         at paragraph 37.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [64] There are further examples of s.112(2) offences involving offences of dishonesty. In  
        R v Huynh  
        [2005] NSWCCA 220, this Court upheld a finding that an offence lay towards the middle of the range of gravity of offences of this kind in circumstances where the offender, in company, smashed the door of domestic premises and collected a large amount of personal property, including jewellery, watches and precious stones (paragraphs 26-27). The nature of the circumstances of aggravation defined in s.105A  
        Crimes Act 1900  
        as applied to the individual case may be relevant to characterisation of the particular offence on the range of objective seriousness:  
        R v Huynh 
         at paragraphs 29-30. In  
        R v Ceissman  
        [2004] NSWCCA 466, a s.112(2) offence committed upon bank premises entered with the use of a sledgehammer and where $171,980.00 was stolen, was characterised as being above the mid-range of objective seriousness (paragraphs 5, 19). In circumstances where a stranger broke and entered residential premises occupied by older persons who were then tied up and with property being stolen from the premises, it was found that the offence lay above the mid-range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type:  
        R v Porteous  
        at paragraph 47.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [65] These cases are referred to for illustrative purposes and not for the purpose of defining a range for s.112(2) offences. They do, however, throw light on factors which may bear upon an assessment of objective seriousness in the particular circumstances of s.112(2) offences.” 
        
       
      
    38 Irrespective of whether his Honour’s overstatement of the objective seriousness of the offence offends the principle of proportionality, his failure to approach the sentence in accordance with the approach mandated by this Court in R v Way is an error that might of itself have warranted the intervention of this Court subject, of course, to the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (see Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 and R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186). However, because of what I regard as a clear error in his Honour’s approach to the discount for the plea of guilty in the ultimate calculation of sentence, an error which does require this Court to re-sentence, it is not necessary to consider whether his Honour’s overstatement of the objective seriousness of the offence and his failure to approach the sentence as mandated by Way’s case has, of itself, resulted in an excessive sentence as contended for by the applicant.  
     
      
    Error in the approach to the plea of guilty  
     
      
    39 In Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; 215 ALR 213, the High Court regarded a mathematical or tiered approach to sentencing as productive of error. Save only for where the legislature has proscribed the weight or value to be given to matters bearing upon the calculation of sentence, the High Court mandated an approach to sentencing that emphasised the importance of the discretion that is reposed in the sentencing judge in affording proper weight to all relevant considerations and then instinctively synthesizing these sometimes competing considerations so as to arrive at a fair and balanced sentencing outcome.  
     
      
    40 This Court, both prior to the High Court’s review of sentencing practices in Markarian and since, has repeatedly criticised an approach to sentence where the addition or subtraction of months or years from another figure as a notional starting point fixes the time an offender must serve in prison.  
     
      
    41 In my view, his Honour’s reasoning reveals an error in approach of this kind and an error which has resulted in the applicant being deprived of the discount to which he was entitled for the utilitarian value of his early plea of guilty. I have already referred to his Honour’s failure to approach the applicant’s sentence in accordance with the principles in R v Way. I need only add that where sentence is to be passed following a plea of guilty, a principled approach requires that it is only after an assessment has been made of objective seriousness and only after consideration has been given to the weight of subjective matters, that allowance is given for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty so as to arrive at a sentence that is appropriate in all the circumstances.  
     
      
    42 Instead of this approach his Honour determined by reference to what he described as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the terrorising of the victims and everyone else in the house, and the concern for the community and the courts, for the message to offenders in domestic violence situations, and even considering the subjective factors for the offender, that a period of actual custody of around four years must be considered.” 
        
       
      
    He then said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…to arrive at the non parole custody of four years I will start with a term of eight years then allow for the plea of guilty to take the starting point to six years, with a four year non parole period.” 
        
       
      
    43 By this approach, his Honour has failed to give effect to the 25 per cent discount to which the applicant was entitled by erroneously making allowance for it in a mathematical exercise undertaken in reverse and to justify what his Honour described as “the end point”. Since for this reason I am of the view that this Court should re-sentence the applicant, it is not necessary that I consider whether his Honour also erred in his approach to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
      Sentence 
      
    44 In my view and for the reasons set out above, the objective seriousness of the offending falls within the mid-range for offences of this kind. I consider that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation (which must be assessed as good by reference to the evidence on sentence) are supplemented and improved having regard to the affidavit evidence received at the hearing of the appeal. He has sought ongoing assistance from programs within the prison designed to address his offending. He is described as a polite and hardworking inmate willing to pass on his skills to fellow inmates. It would appear that for these reasons he has attracted a minimum security rating. He clearly acknowledges that his loss of control has resulted in the loss of his family and that, just as he had experienced violence at his father’s hand, by his own conduct he has failed to provide a stable environment for his son. I accept that he is genuinely committed to repairing the damage he has done and is genuinely remorseful. 
     
      
    45 The affidavit of Ms Pahl tendered on re-sentence is also relevant to re-sentence. To my thinking, it also permits this Court to approach the issue of rehabilitation in a most favourable light. She makes it plain that her support for the applicant is ongoing, reflected as much by what she says as by the fact that she has travelled some distance to visit the applicant to ensure the relationship with his son is maintained. She acknowledges the legal principles that warrant sentences being imposed for domestic violence offenders but impresses on the Court her assessment of the applicant’s violence on the day of the offending as being “totally out of character for him” as a man she says she has loved and lived with for seven years. She describes the applicant as a “good man and a great father and provider”. Although I am mindful of the caution that should be exercised before evidence of a victim’s forgiveness is given undue weight in a sentencing exercise, and also mindful of the observations of Simpson J in R v Glen to which I have already referred, I am persuaded in the particular facts of this case to give Ms Pahl’s evidence significant weight.  
     
      
    46 In my view, the applicant’s plea of guilty of itself provides a sound basis for departing from the standard non-parole period however, consistent with a proper and principled approach, I use it as a reference point. The assessment of objective seriousness as within the mid-range and the subjective matters to which reference has been made are also such as to warrant a departure from the standard non-parole period. 47 Although his Honour did not approach the question of special circumstances in accordance with R v Simpson, his conclusion that special circumstances existed was nevertheless appropriate. I propose however to vary the statutory proportion by a greater margin, consistent with what I consider to be the need for supervision on the applicant’s release so as to ensure his ongoing commitment to managing anger and to exercising control over his consumption of alcohol. 
     
      
    48 After applying a discount of 25 per cent for the early plea of guilty, I consider a non-parole period of two years and six months represents the minimum term of imprisonment which ought be served by the applicant. 49 Accordingly, I make the following orders: 
     
      
      (i) Grant leave to appeal.  
       
        
        (ii) Allow the appeal and quash the sentences imposed in the District Court.  
         
        (iii) In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 7 April 2007 and expiring on 6 October 2009 with a balance of term of eighteen months expiring on 6 April 2011.

      342/2007 - REGINA v John Frederick THOMPSON 
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: John Frederick Thompson (hereinafter called “the offender”) pleaded guilty to the offence that on 28 January 2006 at Airds in the State of New South Wales he did murder Fallon Baker contrary to s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    2 The offender advised the Court on 8 November 2007 that he intended to plead guilty to the charge on the basis that his intention at the time was to inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased. The Crown advised the Court that it accepted the offender’s plea on that basis. His trial was due to commence on 12 November 2007 and his plea of guilty was formally entered on that day. 
     
      
    3 It is now my responsibility to sentence the offender for that crime, having heard submissions on sentence from both the Crown and Ms Betts, counsel for the offender, on 14 November 2007 and 8 February 2008. 
     
      
       
      Background facts 
       
      
    4 At the time of the offence the deceased (aged 18) and the offender (aged 22) lived together at 20 Dangar Way, Airds. They had been in a de facto relationship for about three years. They had one child from the relationship, Dylan, who was 19 months old. 
     
      
    5 There was a history of domestic discord in the relationship. Before the offence the deceased’s family and friends had observed on occasions a number of injuries to the deceased, including black eyes, fat lips and bruising to her arms, neck and face. 
     
      
    6 On 24 August 2005 the offender punched the deceased in the face. This assault was reported to the police and the offender was convicted and placed on a 12 month s 9 good behaviour bond. An apprehended violence order was also granted to protect the deceased. In addition to the general conditions of the order, the offender was subject to a condition which prohibited him from approaching the deceased within 12 hours of consuming intoxicating liquor. 
     
      
    7 The present offence was committed during the term of the bond and also during the period during which the apprehended violence order was in force. 
     
      
    8 On Friday, 27 January 2006 at about 10 pm the offender went to the car-park area of the Riverside Inn at Airds where he commenced drinking alcohol with a group of friends. At about 11 pm the deceased and her sister drove to where the offender was drinking with his friends. The offender and the deceased spoke for a short time. According to the deceased’s sister, the deceased and the offender were getting on very well at the time. 
     
      
    9 After leaving the offender, the deceased picked up their son, Dylan, and arrived home at about 11.30 pm. The offender stayed in the car-park area drinking with his friends. During that time the offender consumed about half a cask of wine and about six bottles of full strength beer. 
     
      
    10 At about 1 am the offender walked with a group of people to 6 Woolwash Place, Airds where he continued drinking in a backyard. The offender drank a premixed can of Johnny Walker and then began drinking Jim Beam bourbon and coke which he mixed himself. 
     
      
    11 At about 2.15 am a Mr Shaun Presdee joined the offender and his group. A short time later Mr Presdee was assaulted by some of the persons in the group including the offender. The other males eventually stopped assaulting Mr Presdee, but the offender continued. Eventually it was necessary for the offender to be restrained and the fight ended. The offender stayed in the rear of the yard with a small group of people. 
     
      
    12 Between 4 and 5 am the offender left the party. At this time Mr Mark Siaa and some of his friends were sitting in front of premises at 154 Riverside Drive, Airds. The offender walked along Riverside Drive and when he saw these persons he stopped to speak to them. 
     
      
    13 The offender knew Mr Siaa because the deceased had been in an on-and-off again intimate relationship with him until the deceased started seeing the offender in about 2003. The deceased and Mr Siaa had remained close friends. According to Mr Siaa and the deceased’s family the offender was jealous of this friendship. 
     
      
    14 Whilst the offender was speaking to these persons a dispute arose about something that the offender had allegedly said about Mr Siaa. The offender denied having said anything derogatory about Mr Siaa. The comment was then made “Well it would have had to have come from your woman. I don’t know who else would say it. Why don’t you go home when you’re straight and sort it out with her”. A short time later the offender left these persons and continued walking home. 
     
      
       
      The offence 
       
      
    15 The offender arrived home some time between 5 and 6 am. The offender entered the house through the back door, which the deceased had left open for him. The offender walked up the stairs to the master bedroom where the deceased was sleeping. As the offender approached the deceased he was yelling in a loud voice calling the deceased a “fucking slut”. This woke the deceased and she said something like “What’s wrong?” The offender then punched the deceased in the face and at the same time was saying, “Why do you have to talk shit behind my back?” 
     
      
    16 The offender’s recollection of what thereafter occurred is variable. On occasions he said that he had no further recollection and on other occasions he appeared to remember isolated events which occurred. I am satisfied that these islands of recollection accurately record what happened. 
     
      
    17 The offender recalled the deceased getting up and he continued to yell at her, repeatedly calling her a “slut”. At some point in time the offender recalled seeing the deceased on the floor of the bedroom. When the offender left the room he saw the deceased sitting up hunched over on the floor “crying or making some noise”. Witnesses in neighbouring duplexes heard the offender yelling and heard a lot of banging.  
     
      
    18 At some stage during the assault on the deceased, Dylan woke up and climbed out of his cot. The offender recalled putting him back in his cot and going downstairs. The offender turned the television on and lay on the lounge from where he continued to yell at the deceased. At some stage the offender fell asleep. 
     
      
    19 I accept what the offender said in his electronically recorded interview with the police that after seeing the deceased’s ex boyfriend, Mr Siaa, he became angry with the deceased because he believed that the deceased was still involved with Mr Siaa. 
     
      
    20 The precise sequence of events during the course of the offender’s attack on the deceased will never be known. The report of Dr Ellis, who conducted the post mortem on the deceased, gave the cause of death as due to the effects of head injury (blunt force trauma). 
     
      
    21 When police attended 20 Dangar Way, the following objects were located near, on or around the deceased’s body: 
     
      
      Neck and glass fragments from a Jack Daniels Tennessee whisky bottle. 
       
      Half a metal television stand fitted with wheels (the glass base of the stand had been smashed and glass fragments located). 
       
      Broken television casing. 
       
      Broken television screen. 
       
      Pedestal fan with dented white metal pipe. 
       
      Metal candelabra (tangled in the deceased’s hair). 
       
      
    22 Investigations carried out by Constable Lambousis, an expert in blood spatter analysis, reached the following conclusions. 
     
      
       
      (a) The extent of the blood spatter deposited throughout the main bedroom indicated a prolonged assault. 
       
       
      (b) The concentration of bloodstains low on the wall suggested that the victim was lying on the floor during part of the assault. 
       
       
      (c) The presence of six separate bloodlines of travel suggests a minimum of seven blows. 
       
       
      (d) The extent of the damage to items, the facial and head injuries on the deceased and the amount of impact spatter and transfer stains suggested a sustained assault. 
       
      
    23 I find beyond reasonable doubt that the assault was prolonged and sustained and that not only did the offender punch the deceased on a number of occasions, but he also kicked her whilst she was lying on the floor against the wall. 
     
      
       
      Subsequent events 
       
      
    24 At some time that morning, before midday, Dylan climbed out of his cot and went downstairs and woke the offender. The offender went upstairs and saw the deceased lying naked on the bedroom floor. The offender saw that the deceased was covered in blood, was badly bruised and had a swollen eye. He saw that there was a large amount of blood on the floor and walls. Situated around the deceased were broken glass fragments and the other objects previously described. The offender attempted to wake the deceased but could feel that she was cold. The offender’s trousers, shoes and socks had blood on them. 
     
      
    25 The offender collected Dylan from downstairs and walked to the house of Maria Brown at 24 Teeswater Place, Airds. The offender left Dylan with one of Ms Brown’s sons. At the time Dylan was only wearing a nappy and he had blood on his left leg, right arm and jaw line. Dylan did not have any signs of injury. 
     
      
    26 The offender took Ms Brown to 20 Dangar Way and showed her the deceased. Ms Brown touched the deceased’s chest which felt cold. Ms Brown made arrangements for the offender to attend Campbelltown Police Station. 
     
      
    27 At about 12.05 pm the offender, Ms Brown and a Mr Nasser Rajab went to Campbelltown Police Station. As they were speaking to police about the offender’s son, Detective Napier noticed that the offender had blood on his shoes. The offender was questioned about the blood. As a result of that questioning Detective Napier arranged for other police to attend the offender’s premises to check on the welfare of the deceased. 
     
      
    28 The offender was given a general caution. Detective Napier said to the offender “Is there anything you want to tell me?” The offender said, “That’s why I came in here. If anything happened I’ve come to give myself up”. Detective Napier said, “If anything happened to your girlfriend who would have done it?” The offender said “Me”. 
     
      
    29 A short time later Detective Napier was informed that police had located the deceased at 20 Dangar Way. The offender was placed under arrest for the murder of the deceased. The offender has been in custody since 28 January 2006. 
     
      
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    30 The offender was born in New Zealand on 8 June 1983 and is of Samoan origin. He was raised by his mother and maternal grandmother. His parents separated before he was born and he is the only child from that union. The offender says that from the age of five, he grew up with a stepfather who was a violent alcoholic. He has two half siblings on his father’s side and four half siblings on his mother’s side. 
     
      
    31 The offender lived in New Zealand until 1994 when he was sent back to Samoa where he remained until 2001. It seems the move to Samoa took place because of early behavioural problems in New Zealand. The offender says that between the ages of 11 and 12 while in Samoa a maternal uncle sexually interfered with him. 
     
      
    32 The offender was educated in Samoa until 2001. He returned to New Zealand in 2001 and came to Australia in June of that year. He met his father for the first time and lived with him in Queensland for a few months. He moved to Sydney in late 2001. Between that date and the date of his arrest he worked as a truckie’s offsider with two different councils where he did landscaping. He was employed in the demolition industry and has washed trucks. He also did some security work. In 2004 he started working as a car-park attendant and was doing that type of work on and off until the date of his arrest. 
     
      
    33 His first significant relationship occurred in 2002 and lasted for about four months. His second significant relationship was with the deceased and that commenced on 26 June 2003. Dylan his son from this relationship is his only child. 
     
      
    34 This is the first time that the offender has been in custody. He is in the main section of the prison and says that he gets on with the officers and other inmates. In the past he received visits from friends and from some family members but these have ceased in more recent times. His father is aware of this offence and there has been some contact. He has lost contact with his mother who remains in New Zealand. 
     
      
    35 The offender was referred to Dr Bruce Westmore, psychiatrist, by his legal advisers. He saw Dr Westmore on three occasions: 1 September 2006, 29 August 2007 and 15 January 2008. 
     
      
    36 It is clear from what the offender told Dr Westmore and from his police interviews that before the offence he was abusing drugs and alcohol. Before the offence he was using heroin, amphetamines and ice. He often combined cannabis with alcoholic consumption. He used cannabis on a daily basis. His pattern of drinking was of a binge kind. He did not drink every day but when he did drink, the quantities involved were large and he usually had little or no recollection of what he had been doing. He engaged in episodes of violence which were usually associated with alcohol abuse. 
     
      
    37 The offender told Dr Westmore that he had been hearing voices since he was about 17. He described the voices as female and internal. They spoke to him in his own language. They told him to hurt people and to do specific things. Sometimes he could not understand what the voices were saying. He did not tell anyone about these voices until after he was placed in custody. He said “No, I kept it to myself. I didn’t want people to know”. The voices were not present all the time, but only sometimes. He said that he used drugs and alcohol to get rid of the voices. 
     
      
    38 The offender commenced receiving treatment for those voices at the end of 2006 and the voices had stopped by May or June 2007. Those hallucinations have continued to be under control. Dr Westmore diagnosed a psychotic illness such as schizophrenia or a drug related induced psychosis. 
     
      
    39 The circumstances of the offence as described to Dr Westmore by the offender are set out in his report of 21 January 2008 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “I then asked him why did he think this tragedy occurred. He stated “I was just bottling up too much, emotions and excess use of alcohol. It wasn’t a good mix. I snapped on the wrong person and the voices were bothering me too much.” 
        
       
       
        
        I asked Mr Thompson to confirm that he had been concerned that his girlfriend had been having an affair with her ex boyfriend. He nodded in the affirmative. He then spoke spontaneously and stated “Not only that, but a lot of other things were on my mind”. I asked him about those other things and he said he was stressed at work and “stressed from life”. He confirmed on the night of the incident he had had a fight with his girlfriend’s ex boyfriend, he said it was an argument rather than a fight. I asked him what they’d argued about and he said “He thought I was going around talking shit about him”.” 
        
       
      
    40 The offender told Dr Westmore that he had used illicit drugs in prison including heroin, cocaine and “bupe”. He had been taking those drugs intravenously and had used them about twenty times between August 2006 and August 2007. He said that he had stopped drug use when he commenced a methadone program in 2007. 
     
      
    41 In January 2008 when Dr Westmore asked about his drug abuse in prison the offender said he had taken cannabis, heroin and buprenorphrine. He said that he had last used drugs a few months before. The offender told Dr Westmore that he had attended about six drug and alcohol courses while in prison and that he wanted to do more courses to help with his drug problem. In relation to his drug behaviour generally he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “At present there is nothing in the world that can take away the pain except drugs. I know if I get out I will use drugs again to get away from the pain. I used to use a lot of ice on the outside.” 
        
       
      
    42 When Dr Westmore asked the offender did he feel sorry for what he had done he said “Yes”. He said: “Sometimes I wish I was dead so I could be with her”. Dr Westmore asked him to confirm that he had no active thoughts of harming himself despite that last statement and the offender said: “No, because I have to live for my son”. 
     
      
    43 Dr Westmore expressed his conclusion in relation to the offender as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “This tragic incident has occurred as a result of a combination of factors. It would seem that Mr Thompson had a belief that his girlfriend was being unfaithful, he was heavily intoxicated at the time of the incident. While he describes the presence of auditory perceptual disturbances on the day of the incident, he could not remember whether he heard voices during the night leading up to when the offence occurred. He was not able to give a detailed or specific account about the presence of auditory hallucinations or their possible impact on him and his behaviour. I offered the view previously that it was not possible to determine whether his act of aggression occurred as a result of alcohol abuse and jealousy as opposed to an act of aggression which may have arisen as a result of mental illness. I thought that if he had a past history of alcohol generated violence towards the deceased or others, then on the balance of probability his actions towards the deceased were generated primarily by alcohol. I did not think he had a psychiatric defence to the charges. 
        
       
       
        
        As can be seen from this report, Mr Thompson continues to struggle with his drug abuse problems. His risk of re-offending will be significantly reduced if he can enter into and maintain sobriety from drugs and alcohol. He has some insight into his continuing vulnerability regarding drug use and any long-term treatment plan necessarily will include an extended period of community based drug rehabilitation. He also needs to attend further drug and alcohol rehabilitation courses in custody. This man probably does not have an antisocial personality disorder and the offending behaviour is unlikely to have arisen from personality traits of that type either. As in most homicides, a combination of factors were involved leading up to the tragedy with alcohol and/or drug abuse playing a principal role in this particular case.” 
        
       
      
    44 The Probation and Parole Service presentence report prepared by Ms Bentham is to similar effect to the reports of Dr Westmore. She identified the need to deal with the offender’s poly-substance abuse if re-offending was to be avoided. She also recommended participation in a Violent Offenders’ Therapeutic Program and ongoing psychiatric treatment. 
     
      
    45 Exhibit 2 comprised a handwritten letter from the offender to the court expressing his remorse and sorrow at the offence and his hope that one day Dylan would forgive him. 
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statements 
       
      
    46 A victim impact statement from the deceased’s mother Raema Baker was read to the Court by a support person and victim impact statements from the deceased’s brothers Todd, Caine, Aaron, Owen and Steven Baker were read to the Court. Those statements provide eloquent testimony to the love which her family had for the deceased. Despite her young age, it is clear that the deceased had a calming and restraining influence upon her brothers and provided support for her mother. She had a strong relationship and bond with her brothers’ children and those children have suffered deeply as a result of her death. The statements refer to the loss which Dylan has experienced in having lost a loving mother and being forced to live his life without ever knowing her.  
     
      
    47 These statements afford clear evidence of the value of the life of the deceased and the grief her death has occasioned to all her loved ones. It is appropriate that the loss of the deceased and its consequences for the family and for the community is here acknowledged. 
     
      
    48 Nevertheless I must heed the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the decisions in R v Previtera (1977) 94 A Crim R 76; R v Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [43] and R v King [2004] NSWCCA 444 at [171] and approach my sentencing task objectively and dispassionately. It is not appropriate, following the authorities mentioned, that I take those victim impact statements into account in determining an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
       
      Objective seriousness 
       
      
    49 The maximum penalty for the crime of murder under s 19A of the Crimes Act is imprisonment for life. The maximum penalty is intended for cases falling within the worst category for which that penalty has been prescribed (s 61 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) (the Act). It was submitted on behalf of the Crown and the offender that this offence did not fall within the worst category. I agree. Accordingly a specified term of imprisonment in accordance with s 21(1) of the Act should be imposed. 
     
      
    50 That does not end the matter. The offence was committed after 1 February 2003. Accordingly the provisions of s 54A and 54B of the Act apply. The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder is 20 years. 
     
      
    51 Those sections relevantly provide:  
     
      
       
        
        “54A (1) For the purposes of this Division, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        54B (1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence set out in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s 21A. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 
        
       
       
        
        …”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    52 There are difficulties in interpreting these sections. They were identified by Studdert J in R v White [2005] NSWSC 667 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “32 What then is an offence of murder in the middle range of objective seriousness, to which the standard non parole period relates? 
         
         
         
        33 There is no statutory definition to assist in determining this. Whilst all murders are, of course, to be regarded as extremely serious, the range of circumstances which may bear upon the objective gravity of this category of crime is widely variable. 
        
       
       
        
        34 I find it extremely difficult to determine where the boundaries of the middle range of objective seriousness of the crime of murder are to be set, but proper consideration of the significance of s 54A and s 54B requires that I endeavour to assess where the offender’s crime would lie in relation to the middle of the range, heeding what was said in  
        Way 
        , particularly at paras [72] –[102]. How else can I use the middle of the range as a guidepost as I endeavour to arrive at an appropriate sentence? 
        
       
       
        
        35 Section 54B(2) requires the Court to set the standard non parole sentence in a case to which the section applies “unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non parole period that is longer or shorter” than that standard period.  
         
         
        36 It was determined in  
        Way 
         (see para [118]) that whether there are reasons for departing from the standard period will depend upon consideration of: 
         
         
          
          “(i) the objective seriousness of the offence, considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
           
           
          (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1).”” 
          
         
        
       
      
    53 In this case my task has been made somewhat easier in that the offender entered a plea of guilty before the commencement of his trial. In accordance with the guidance in R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168, that of itself provides a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period. Nevertheless, as R v Way made clear and as Studdert J remarked in R v White, the existence of the standard non-parole period remains as a guidepost and reference point to assist the Court in formulating an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    54 As a start point in the process of reasoning recommended in R v Way, it needs to be remembered that murder is a crime which can be committed under a wide range of circumstances. There are always significant differences in the subjective circumstances. Generally an offence involving an intent to kill is more serious than one where the intention is to inflict grievous bodily harm (R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at [34]). Similarly, a murder which is not premeditated is usually regarded as less serious than one which involves planning. 
     
      
    55 The attack on the deceased was not premeditated. Until the contact between the offender and Mr Siaa and his companions at about 4-5 am, relations between the offender and the deceased were not only cordial but they appear to have been affectionate insofar as the deceased’s sister was able to judge earlier. It was the confrontation with Mr Siaa and his friends which provoked a fit of jealous rage in the offender. I should at this point make it clear that these feelings of jealousy were entirely unjustified. That combined with the offender’s heavy intake of alcohol led to his attack on the deceased when he arrived home shortly afterwards. I find that the attack on her was not premeditated, nor was it planned. 
     
      
    56 There was no issue between the Crown and the defence that at the time of the attack the offender intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the deceased but did not intend to kill her.  
     
      
    57 The offence appears to have been committed as a result of a sudden onset of rage brought about by the confrontation between the offender and Mr Siaa. The attack on the deceased appears to have been spontaneous. The offender’s advanced state of intoxication also needs to be taken into account on the question of intent. 
     
      
    58 Another consideration is the behaviour of the offender after the attack on the deceased. He did not attempt to escape nor conceal his crime but went to sleep after watching television. He was surprised and shocked when he observed the results of his actions at midday when he went to the bedroom. These circumstances are inconsistent with the actions of a person who had intended to kill the deceased and who believed he had successfully carried out that intention. 
     
      
    59 There is simply no evidence to justify a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had an intention to kill. All the available evidence indicates that the intention was to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased and I so find. 
     
      
    60 It was submitted, on behalf of the offender, that the objective gravity of the offence was reduced because of the offender’s mental health problems and in that regard general deterrence should not be given as much weight as it normally would. I do not agree. 
     
      
    61 These matters were carefully considered by Dr Westmore. It is clear from his analysis that whether or not the offender suffered from some schizophrenic condition, it made no contribution to his actions on the night of the offence. 
     
      
    62 The offender’s actions were fuelled by an unjustified belief that the deceased had been unfaithful to him and by his resentment of Mr Siaa against a background of very heavy drinking. The offender engaged in this episode of binge drinking in circumstances where he knew from previous experience that he often acted violently when he was heavily affected by alcohol. 
     
      
    63 I should say something more about the offender’s advanced state of intoxication. Clearly, as the plea of guilty concedes, it was not sufficient to prevent the offender forming the necessary intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. Nevertheless it is a matter to be properly taken into account as part of the background circumstances. It is relevant to take into account that alcohol played a significant part in causing the offender to lose control and act in such a violent way. That having been said, it was well known to the offender that when heavily affected by alcohol he was prone to behave violently and that on occasion such violent behaviour was directed against the deceased. 
     
      
    64 In those circumstances whilst it is relevant to take into account the part that alcohol played in the offence, it does not greatly reduce the objective seriousness of it. I do not accept that any mental health problems on the part of the offender should reduce the objective seriousness of the offence and accordingly general deterrence remains a significant factor to be taken into account. 
     
      
    65 As required by s 54B of the Act, I need to take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in s 21A of the Act. 
     
      
    66 There was an issue between the parties as to whether the offender used a weapon in his attack upon the deceased (s 21A(2)(c)). On behalf of the offender it was submitted that the Court could not be so satisfied because despite the objects found near the deceased, none except the fan had blood on them. In that regard it was submitted that there was no evidence of skin or congealed blood on the fan, rather the evidence was that of blood spatter. 
     
      
    67 The Crown relied upon the violence of the assault per se, the blood on the fan and the position of the objects surrounding the body of the deceased. The Crown also relied upon the opinion of Dr Ellis that “some of the injuries which were present suggested the impact and fracturing of pieces of glass”. 
     
      
    68 While I agree with the submission put on behalf of the offender, that the Court cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did use a weapon to attack the deceased, it seems to me that the question is largely academic. The attack was clearly a violent and frenzied one. The seriousness of the offence is clear when one considers the comparative size of the deceased and the offender and the nature of her injuries, particularly those to the head, and the use by the offender of his fists and feet in the attack.  
     
      
    69 The only matter of significance in the offender’s previous criminal record relates to an assault by him against the deceased in August 2005 when he was heavily intoxicated. This of itself does not count greatly against him (s 21A(2)(d)) except that it involves the same type of conduct which brought about the death of the deceased on this occasion. The real matter of aggravation, for the purposes of s 21A(2), is that this offence was committed when the offender was on conditional liberty being subject to a bond and the offence involved a breach of the apprehended violence order which was still effective (s 21A(2)(j)). 
     
      
    70 I agree with the submission of the offender that the fact that the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence (s 21A(2)(b)) and that the emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offender was substantial  
     
      
      (s 21A(2)(g)) do not amount to matters of aggravation. This is because these subsections give rise to features which are elements of the offence to which the offender has pleaded. These features were present but they are the inevitable elements in any offence of murder, it being the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. 
       
      
    71 In relation to mitigating factors, it was submitted on behalf of the offender that he was unlikely to re-offend (s 21A(3)(g)) and that he had good prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)). I am not satisfied that this can be stated in such unequivocal terms. The offending was associated with poly-substance abuse which has continued. Although Dr Westmore and the Probation and Parole Service refer to the fact that the offender has some insight into his problem, neither could offer any unqualified assurance that the offender would be unlikely to re-offend. The offender would need to first bring his substance abuse under control. There remains doubt as to whether that can be achieved. 
     
      
    72 There was no question but that the offender is genuinely remorseful about his conduct. He voluntarily surrendered himself to the police. He has substantially co-operated with the police. His plea of guilty is consistent with this genuine remorse. His letter to the Court and behaviour while in custody support that conclusion.  
     
      
    73 I have regard to and I apply the principles stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to discounts for pleas of guilty in R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The Court of Criminal Appeal there explained the reasons why a plea of guilty should attract a lower sentence. The reasons identified by the Court were firstly, the plea demonstrates remorse or contrition; secondly, the plea has a utilitarian value for the efficiency of the criminal justice system and thirdly, in particular cases there can be a value in avoiding the need to call witnesses, especially victims, to give evidence. The Court of Criminal Appeal suggested a range of 10% - 25% as a discount on sentence for a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    74 In relation to the offender’s plea of guilty, although it was made late, I am of the opinion that he is entitled to a discount because of its utilitarian value. The reason for the delay in the offender’s plea of guilty was to enable the question of mental illness to be fully explored by Dr Westmore. From the material contained in Dr Westmore’s report this was a reasonable approach on the part of the offender’s legal advisers. The Crown agreed that this was so.  
     
      
    75 The utilitarian value of the plea was real because it relieved witnesses, and in particular members of the deceased’s family, having to revisit the events leading up to the deceased’s tragic death under oath in the witness box. The Crown accepted that in the circumstances of this case the offender’s plea of guilty entitled him to a discount within the range of 15%-20%. On the facts of this matter the discount I propose to apply is 15%. 
     
      
    76 All of the above matters are relevant in considering the relative seriousness of the offence for the purposes of sections 54A and 54B of the Act. As was said in R v Way: 
     
      
       
        
        “[86] Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said “objectively” to affect the “seriousness” of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its 
         
        commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example,intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender's capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected:  
        Channon v The Queen 
         (1978) 33 FLR 433 and  
        R v Engert  
        (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. Such matters can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment. Other matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse, are more accurately described as circumstances of the offender and not the offence.  
        
       
       
        
        [87] 
          
        Questions of degree and remoteness arise which will need to be developed in the case law. There are potential areas of overlap. For example, impaired mental or intellectual functioning can go to either, or both, the seriousness of the offence and punishment, so far as deterrence is concerned. 
        
       
       
        
        [88] 
          
        In an assessment of the objective seriousness of the subject offence it seems to us that attention must accordingly be given to the factors mentioned above. Some of these relevant factors will be elements of the offence itself. Others 
         
        will fall within the list of aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(2) and (3) of the Act, so far as they relate to purely objective considerations.” 
         
        
       
      
    77 Taking those matters into account I am satisfied that this offence is not a matter which should be properly characterized as coming within the mid range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. I see the offence as being close to that standard, but below it. Accordingly, I find that the standard non-parole period ought not to apply to the offence. That is not to say that I propose to ignore the standard non-parole period of 20 years. It remains, as the authorities have pointed out, an important guidepost and reference point in the sentencing process (R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [122]). 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    78 The Court was provided by counsel for the offender with a list of cases dealing with sentences imposed for the offence of murder in factual circumstances similar to those surrounding this offence. Those cases which predated the enactment of the standard non-parole period legislation I found of little assistance but the decisions in R v Vu [2005] NSWSC 271 and R v Robinson [2007] NSWSC 460 were helpful. Fundamentally, however, each sentence matter must depend upon its own particular facts. 
     
      
    79 The sentence which I propose to pass includes in it a substantial period during which the offender will be eligible for parole. Accordingly I do not propose to alter the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term in the sentence. To extend the parole period at the expense of the non-parole period would produce a sentence which did not adequately reflect the seriousness of the offence and the purposes of s 3A of the Act. Accordingly, I decline to find special circumstances despite the fact that this will be the offender’s first time in custody (R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704). 
     
      
    80 The offender has a strong subjective case. He had a disrupted and abusive childhood and lacked any positive male role model. I accept that he has some mental illness issues, although for the reasons set out above these played no part in the offence. I accept that the offender has a genuine level of remorse and bitterly regrets what he has done. His plea of guilty is not only indicative of that remorse but has a significant utilitarian value. 
     
      
    81 I have also had regard to the particular circumstances of the offence in that it was not premeditated and that alcohol played a significant part and that there was no intent to kill but rather an intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    82 On the other hand there were serious aggravating circumstances. When the offender commenced his fatal assault upon the deceased he was at conditional liberty and bound by the terms of an apprehended violence order not to approach the deceased when he had consumed alcohol. Furthermore, this was not his first attack upon the deceased. This was but the latest in a series of assaults. The offender well knew from his previous conviction for assaulting the deceased and from his prior attacks upon her, that when he had been drinking heavily he would take out his violent tendencies on the deceased. Finally there are the circumstances of the offence involving as they do a brutal and violent attack upon a much smaller and defenseless woman. These matters significantly reduce his entitlement to leniency. 
     
      
    83 The offence of murder has always attracted the abhorrence of the community and a sentence for murder must serve the interests of punishment, including denunciation, general and personal deterrence, the protection of the community, retribution and the rehabilitation of the offender. The importance of promoting deterrence in the context of domestic violence in which females are usually subjected to a history of violence before a catastrophic event such as murder occurs, cannot be too strongly emphasized.  
     
      
    84 The Court in sentencing has to take account of the provisions of s 3A of the Act and the purposes therein identified in relation to sentencing, ie to ensure that the offender is adequately punished, to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, to protect the community from the offender, to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, to make the offender accountable for his actions, to denounce the conduct of the offender and to recognize the harm done to the victim and the community. 
     
      
    85 In this case the elements of general deterrence and retribution have considerable relevance because of the serious criminality involved in the unlawful taking of another person’s life. I also have regard to the standard non-parole period provided by s 54A as an important reference point, even though I have declined to apply it. Accordingly, I am satisfied in this case that a lengthy term of imprisonment must necessarily be imposed to give effect to the purposes expressed in s 3A of the Act and to properly reflect the circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    86 The offender has been in custody since 28 January 2006. He has been sentenced to 3 months imprisonment for the assault on Mr Presdee. I propose to allow in the offender’s favour a credit for the time which he has already served in custody, but I also need to have regard to the sentence passed on him for the assault. Accordingly, I propose to make the offender’s sentence partially concurrent with the sentence for assault and to commence from 28 February 2006. The sentence which I have determined has been arrived at with allowance being made for the 15% discount for the offender’s plea of guilty. 
     
      
    87 For the murder of Fallon Baker I sentence you to imprisonment for 20 years such sentence to commence on 28 February 2006 and to expire on 27 February 2026. I fix a non-parole period of 15 years to expire on 27 February 2021. The earliest date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 28 February 2021.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree with Mathews AJ.  
     
      
    2 HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the Reasons for Judgment of Matthews AJ and the orders proposed by her Honour. I agree with her Honour’s Reasons and proposed orders. I would, however, add the following. 
     
      
    3 The Applicant is someone who has undoubtedly had a difficult beginning in life. Such a situation is one fairly entitled to recognition by the Courts. However, he has had far more recognition of this than he could reasonably expect. On no less than three occasions, he had been placed on probation. On no less than four, he has been placed on a bond. On no less than five occasions he has been sentenced to the rising of the Court and this for fifteen separate offences a number of which from their description would by no means seem insignificant. 
     
      
    4 The community cannot reasonably be expected to accept being preyed upon by the Applicant in the way it has for the last 7 years. Persons are entitled not to be assaulted, not to have their homes broken into, not to have their motor vehicles stolen or as occurred in one of the offences with which this Court is presently concerned, destroyed at the Applicant’s whim. 
     
      
    5 One of the purposes of sentencing - see Veen v R [No.2] – (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 – is the protection of society. That and the Applicant’s recidivism argue strongly for penalties well in excess of those the subject of his appeal. Perhaps it is only harsh punishments which will teach him. 
     
      
    6 MATHEWS AJ: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed by Judge Coolahan at the Newcastle District Court on 3 April 2007. Three charges had been laid against the applicant in the Newcastle Local Court. He pleaded guilty to each of them and was committed for sentence. The charges were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Maliciously damaging property by fire pursuant to s 195(b)  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 (“the Act”), committed on 17 March 2006. 
         
         
        2. Aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence (stealing) pursuant to s 112(2), committed on 17 March 2006. 
         
         
        3. Aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence (stealing) pursuant to s 112(2), committed on 31 March 2006.  
        
       
      
    7 In addition the sentencing judge was asked to take into account ten further offences on a Form 1 document when sentencing the applicant in relation to the second of the above charges. 
     
      
    8 The maximum penalty for the first of these offences, under s 195 (1)(b), is imprisonment for ten years. The maximum penalty for the two offences under s 112(2) is imprisonment for twenty years. These offences attract a standard non-parole period of five years. 
     
      
    9 The applicant was sentenced to an effective overall sentence involving a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months commencing on 31 July 2006 with an additional term of 2 years and 7 months.10 The individual sentences were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        In relation to charge number 1 above, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months commencing on 31 July 2006 with an additional term of 6 months.  
        
       
       
        
        In relation to charge number 3 he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 1 year and 10 months commencing on 31 January 2007 with an additional term of 11 months. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the charge number 2, and taking into account the ten charges on the Form 1, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months commencing on 31 January 2008 with an additional term of 2 years and 7 months. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Factual Background 
       
      
    11 Before discussing the grounds of appeal, it is appropriate to say something about the conduct giving rise to the various charges against the applicant. 
     
      
    12 All offences were committed in February and March 2006. Most of them were inter-related and all but three involved offences committed between 13 and 31 March 2006. The exceptions to this were the first three offences on Form 1, which comprised two charges of break, enter and commit serious offence (stealing) and one of taking and driving a conveyance. These offences were committed respectively on 16 February and 10 March 2006.  
     
      
    13 The remaining offences were committed in the following circumstances. On the evening of 13 March 2006 the applicant stole a Toyota Corolla station wagon at Cooks Hill. Not long afterwards he drove the Corolla to Charlestown where he stole an oxyacetylene kit from the back of a utility in a car park and placed it into the stolen Corolla. The stealing of the motor vehicle and the larceny of the kit constituted the fourth and fifth charges in Form 1. 
     
      
    14 In the early hours of the morning on 17 March 2006 the applicant drove the stolen Corolla past a police truck in Nelson Bay. He accelerated away, at one stage turning off his headlights and driving at highly excessive speeds. This constituted the charge of driving in a manner dangerous, the sixth charge in Form 1. 
     
      
    15 The applicant managed to avoid his police pursuers. He left the main road and attempted to drive the Corolla across a dirt track. However it became irretrievably bogged. At that point the applicant lit the stolen oxyacetylene torch inside the vehicle and walked away. The vehicle was completely destroyed by fire. The applicant later told police that he did this deliberately in order to destroy evidence. This gave rise to the charge of maliciously damaging property by fire (charge 1 in paragraph [1] above). 
     
      
    16 After setting fire to the Corolla the applicant walked along a bush track and, after a short time, came across a house which he entered by opening the door. Inside the house at the time were a married couple and their three children, all of them asleep. The applicant stole various items from inside the house including cash, a wallet, credit cards, two mobile phones and various keys. This gave rise to the charge of aggravated breaking, entering and committing a serious indictable offence (charge 2 in paragraph [1]). 
     
      
    17 The applicant then used the keys he had stolen to drive away in the householder’s Toyota landcruiser. This gave rise to a charge of take and drive conveyance (charge 7 in Form 1). Not long afterwards, he removed the roof carrier from the landcruiser in order to change the appearance of the vehicle and avoid detection. This gave rise to a charge of malicious damage (charge 8 in Form 1). 
     
      
    18 The final series of offences commenced in the early hours of the morning on 31 March 2006. Between 2 and 4 am that day the applicant broke into a unit in Nelson Bay by breaking the lock of a rear door. Three men were asleep in the house at the time. One of them woke up and called out. The applicant fled, taking with him three mobile phones and a wallet. This constituted the offence of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence (charge 3 in paragraph [1]). 
     
      
    19 Later that day the applicant gave one of the stolen mobile phones to an acquaintance in exchange for amphetamines. This constituted the offence of disposing of stolen property (charge 9 in Form 1). 
     
      
    20 The applicant was arrested later that day, 31 March. At the time he was found to be in possession of a knife in his back pocket. This gave rise to the charge of being in custody of a knife in a public place (charge 10 in Form 1). 
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Background 
       
      
    21 The applicant is now nearly 25 years old, having been born on 18 March 1983. He has a very lengthy criminal history which commenced in the Children’s Court in 2000 when he was 17 years old. In that year he was dealt with for numerous offences, including various assaults, break enter and steals and an assault with intent to rob whilst armed with an offensive weapon. His offences since then are too numerous to list. Amongst many others, there are numerous offences of assault and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. He has served several terms of imprisonment and was on a bond at the time of committing these offences.  
     
      
    22 Judge Coolahan had before him a report from Katy Seidler, a clinical psychologist. She reported that the applicant identified himself as an Aboriginal through his mother’s line. His father worked as a warrant officer in the Army which required the family to make frequent moves when he was young. His parents separated when he was 13 years old. He left home at the age of 14 and has lived independently ever since. He has a long history of alcohol abuse: he started drinking at about the age of 10 and by the age of 15 was becoming intoxicated on a daily basis. Later his alcohol intake decreased whilst his use of illicit drugs such as cannabis and amphetamines increased.  
     
      
    23 It is unnecessary for present purposes to describe the details of Ms Seidler’s report. It was referred to at length in Judge Coolahan’s Reasons for Sentence. His Honour took the various subjective matters into account in finding that special circumstances existed so as to break the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the additional term. His Honour took into account the applicant’s plea of guilty. In addition, the applicant had made admissions to police during his ERISP on 1 April 2006 which identified himself as the offender in relation to some offences as to which the police did not otherwise have sufficient evidence to charge him. Pursuant to R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 Judge Coolahan determined that a further discount should be given on account of this assistance. He concluded that an overall discount of 40% to cover both the plea of guilty and the assistance given to the authorities was appropriate. 
     
      
       
      The Submissions on Appeal 
       
      
    24 The applicant relied on the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
    (i) The sentences are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
      (ii) The sentencing judge erred in the approach to pre-sentence custody. 
       
      
    25 In support of the first ground of appeal the applicant submitted that the starting point for the sentences imposed by his Honour, before applying the 40% discount, were manifestly excessive. In particular, it was submitted that the two offences of aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence were at a low range of objective seriousness. This was because stealing is one of the lesser “serious indictable offences”. Moreover, the circumstances of aggravation in each case were at the low end of the scale. The aggravation was constituted by the fact that people were in the houses when the applicant broke into them. However no harm arose from this. In the first offence the occupants were unaware of the applicant’s entry into the premises. In the second offence one of the occupants woke while he was there, upon which he immediately fled. Applicant’s counsel pointed out that the starting point for the overall non-parole period imposed in relation to all offences, before applying the 40% discount, was 6 years and 3 months with an additional term of a little over 4 years and 3 months. It was submitted that this was excessive in the circumstances, and that it led to the imposition of actual sentences which were similarly excessive. 
     
      
    26 The second ground of appeal was that Judge Coolahan erred in his approach to pre-sentence custody. The applicant was arrested in respect of the current offences on 31 March 2006 and remained in custody thereafter. However on 30 October 2006 he was sentenced in the Local Court for unrelated matters to a total of 4 months imprisonment commencing on 17 May 2006. Judge Coolahan took this into account by ordering that the sentences imposed by him should commence on 31 July 2006, four months after the applicant went into custody. The applicant submitted that his Honour erroneously failed to consider the issue of totality when determining the commencement date for the sentences he imposed.  
     
      
    27 As to the first ground of appeal, the respondent disputed that either the starting points or the discounted sentences imposed by Judge Coolahan was excessive. It was submitted that the objective seriousness of the offences amply warranted the sentences imposed in each case. Moreover the applicant’s substantial criminal record meant that significant emphasis needed to be placed on specific deterrence, retribution and denunciation. 
     
      
    28 As to the second ground of appeal, the respondent pointed out that the aggregate term of the pre-existing sentences commenced on 17 May and expired on 22 September 2006. Accordingly, the sentences imposed by Judge Coolahan were partially concurrent with the pre-existing sentences. This indicates that his Honour did take account of the principle of totality. 
     
      
       
      Findings 
       
      
    29 I accept the Crown’s submissions in relation to both grounds of appeal. In my opinion, Judge Coolahan in his very comprehensive Reasons for Sentence, took account of all relevant matters. The starting point for the sentences which he ultimately imposed were not only within the range available in the circumstances, but in my view were eminently reasonable. So too were the sentences ultimately imposed after the discount of 40% 
     
      
    30 Similarly, I can find no error in relation to the manner in which his Honour accumulated the various sentences, nor as to the dates upon which they were specified to commence.  
     
      
    31 In my view neither ground of appeal has been made out. I would propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Lewis Arthur KERR v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    2 KIRBY J: Lewis Arthur Kerr (""the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on 23 February 2007 by the Chief Judge of the District Court, Justice Blanch. Mr Kerr entered an early plea to an indictment which may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : That on 8 November 2005, he did cultivate not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited plant (cannabis) (s23(2)(a) and s33(2)(b)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985: maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000). 
        
       
       
        
      Count 2 
      : That on 8 November 2005, he supplied not less than a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (cannabis) (s25(2) and s33(2)(b)  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        
      1985: maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $385,000). 
       
       
        
      Count 3 
      : That he dealt with the proceeds of crime (s193B(2)  
      Crimes Act 
       1900: maximum penalty 15 years imprisonment). 
       
      
    3 When sentencing on count 1, his Honour was asked to take into account a matter on a Form 1, namely that, at his property near Glen Innes, he had at the time of his arrest, $5,700 cash reasonably suspected of having been stolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained. 
     
      
    4 Taking that matter into account on count 1, his Honour imposed three identical sentences in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3, each concurrent. The sentences were as follows: 
     
      
       
       Imprisonment comprising a non parole period of 3 years to commence on 4 January 2007 and to expire on 3 January 2010; with an additional term of 2 years to commence on 4 January 2010 and to expire on 3 January 2012. 
       
      
    5 The selection of the commencement date took account of the time Mr Kerr had spent in custody after his arrest and before being released to bail (between 9.11.05 and 22.12.05). 
     
      
    6 The applicant relies upon a single ground of appeal, that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Before considering that ground, I should describe the circumstances in which the offences were committed and say something about Mr Kerr's subjective case, as presented to the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
       
      The offences. 
       
      
    7 Mr Kerr was a farmer with a number of properties in the Glen Innes area. On 8 November 2005, the police obtained a warrant to search one of these properties. The warrant was executed at 11.15 pm. Within the main bedroom of the homestead, the police found $5,700 cash, which became the offence on the Form 1. Adjacent to the homestead was a locked shed. Inside the shed there was a coolroom used as a ""sophisticated hydroponic setup"". There were high-powered lights and water trays with a drip feed system attached. Growing under the lights were a number of plants which appeared to be cannabis. The plants were later tested and confirmed to be cannabis. Outside the coolroom there were seedlings, which were also later tested and confirmed as cannabis. They were covered with black plastic and were growing under a lighting system. 
     
      
    8 The police continued their search, examining what was described as a ""chicken shed"". They found blue and yellow drums and a number of hydroponic troughs, as well as multiple pairs of scissors. There was also a large gas powered lamp. Suspended from the ceiling were lengths of bailing wire. Outside the chicken shed, the police noticed black polypipe running from the creek. They followed the pipe which led to a pump and a large crop site. The crop site consisted of three separate plots, each fenced with a six foot high chicken wire fence. Polypipe drip lines fed water to each plot. The area was covered with fawn coloured bird netting. Altogether 366 cannabis plants were found during the search (count 1).  
     
      
    9 The police had information that items may be buried on the property. They found an area covered by dirt and a number of logs. The dirt and logs were removed, revealing 16 grey 200 litre plastic drums with screw top lids. Within four of the drums there were 166 sealed bags containing what was later tested and found to be cannabis heads. The combined weight of the cannabis was 44.86 kilograms (count 2). 
     
      
    10 The search resumed the next day. The police noticed an area where the rock pattern appeared to have been disturbed. It was covered by a branch. The branch was removed as well as soil, revealing the plastic lid of a drum. Within the drum were bags which contained $79,700 in cash (count 3). 
     
      
    11 The applicant gave evidence on sentence. He said that he had been conducting the operation for about three years before his arrest (T13). He was approached by a person, whom he named, with the idea. That person received a share of the proceeds. He employed four or five others who, likewise, obtained a share (T13). He gave the following evidence, which was relevant to count 2, the supply count: (T8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Now there was 44 kilograms approximately of cannabis found in drums on your property. How long had that been there? 
         
        A. Well some of it had only been put there that year but some of it has been accumulated over the last three years."" 
        
       
      
    12 The matter came to light as a result of an operation by the New South Wales Crime Commission. The police interviewed a number of persons said to have been involved, obtaining ""induced statements"" from them. As a consequence, as the sentencing Judge remarked, ""nobody else was prosecuted"". That plainly rankled with Mr Kerr since one of those involved was a woman with whom he had been having an affair, Ms Michelle Griffith. Mr Kerr told the parole officer who compiled the Probation and Parole Report (30.10.06), and repeated to a psychologist (Gorrell: report 20.11.06), that Ms Griffith had been involved in the distribution of cannabis, from which she derived income. At a time when he was ambivalent about continuing with the enterprise, she effectively blackmailed him into pressing on by threatening to advise the police and expose their affair to his wife. Counsel for the applicant, in written submissions, said that Mr Kerr was ""not cross examined to controvert these facts"" (at [5]). 
     
      
    13 The sentencing Judge dealt with this aspect as follows: (ROS: 5) 
     
      
       
        
        "" … he and his wife had not been enjoying a happy relationship for a good period of time. She was working but not contributing anything to the property itself, and he ended up forming a relationship with another woman, and it is this woman who he says encouraged him to keep growing cannabis and selling it at a time when he thought that he would like to stop. She apparently is one of the persons who was induced to make a statement."" 
        
       
      
    14 His affair with Ms Griffith ended some time before his arrest. Indeed, he began a relationship with another woman who gave evidence on his behalf at the sentencing hearing (T19). Notwithstanding the role of Ms Griffith, Mr Kerr acknowledged responsibility. The report from the psychologist included the following: (p10) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He takes full responsibility for his offences and at no time did he seek to water down his offences or pass responsibility onto anyone else."" 
        
       
      
    15 It was, as his Honour remarked, clearly a ""commercial venture for gain"" (ROS: 3). Mr Kerr gave the following evidence concerning his role in that venture: (T13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So it'd be fair to say you were the principal in this matter, it's your cannabis grown on your property and you're paying other people to cultivate for you, which you're paying them to do? 
         
        A. Yeah, you could say that."" 
        
       
      
    16 Let me turn from the offence to the offender. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    17 A very strong subjective case was presented on behalf of Mr Kerr. He was born in May 1954 in Glen Innes. He came from a large family. He was still very young when his father was injured at the saw mill. His father, thereafter, could not work. He left school at the age of 14 years. He began working as a cook with a shearing shed. He ultimately worked as a cook for the University of New England and the Menzies Hotel. He opened restaurants in Glen Innes and was involved in catering. He married and had four children, all now adults apart from his youngest, who was seven years old at the date of the trial. 
     
      
    18 His Honour accepted that Mr Kerr had no criminal convictions, noting that a s10 Bond had been imposed after his arrest, arising from a charge of malicious damage. The charge related to a dispute with Ms Griffith, the person with whom he had an affair at the time of the offence. His Honour said: (ROS 4) 
     
      
       
        
        "" … I believe the offender is entitled to have me deal with him on the basis that he has got no prior criminal history."" 
        
       
      
    19 In 1992, Mr Kerr purchased a farm. He was described by the sentencing Judge as a ""hard working dedicated farmer"" who had been, until these offences, regarded as ""one of the pillars of the community in the country"" (ROS 4). Indeed, he was still so regarded by many who provided references which were placed before the sentencing Judge. His Honour included in his remarks one episode, the subject of evidence before him, which demonstrated his ""good qualities"". His Honour said this: (ROS 7) 
     
      
       
        
        "" … when he was arrested he and spent almost two months in custody he found it very hard being in prison, and when he was in prison he met a young prisoner called Reid who has had a long history of drinking and violence and has a long criminal record. Mr Reid, as is the case with so many people who end up in gaol in that situation had nowhere to go when he got out. The offender offered him the chance to go and live on his farm, Mr Reid took that up and he has been on the farm now for a period of 18 months, and he says that he believes that learning to be a farmer, and the work involved in it, and living by the natural limits of daylight and dark and the hard work involved has made a significant change to his life, and he has been out of trouble. … "" 
        
       
      
    20 There was, in addition, evidence which furnished an explanation (although not an excuse) for the serious criminal conduct of Mr Kerr. The 16 years he had spent as a farmer coincided with a prolonged and severe drought. His brother-in-law, who had worked on the property, described it as ""a dustbowl"". Mr Kerr told the psychologist that, during those 16 years, he had only earned ""a respectable profit"" in two years (Gorrell report p5). He attempted to combat the drought by diversification, including grain growing, superfine wool and free range eggs. One gathers that each of these ventures had been unsuccessful. More recently, and on a fairly large scale, he had begun breeding dogs and had at last found a business which held some promise. However, at the time he began growing cannabis, financially it was a struggle to survive. He participated successfully in farm debt mediation with his bank and avoided foreclosure. At the time of his arrest, he was supplementing his income by working two days a week as a cook. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing Judge, having referred to this hardship, said this: (ROS 3/4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is no doubt, therefore, that a prison sentence has to be imposed, and that prison sentence must be one which contains significant elements of general deterrence. That is so because farmers cannot solve their problems by embarking on illegal activities such as this. The distribution of drugs in our community is a major scourge, and although cannabis is seen as being a less serious drug than many of the other drugs in the community nonetheless it is regarded as a harmful drug, and the distribution of it must be deterred."" 
        
       
      
    22 Later in his remarks, his Honour again underlined the importance of general deterrence, saying this: (ROS 8) 
     
      
       
        
        "" … it is regarded as important for courts when imposing sentences such as this to pass a sentence which clearly gives a message to the community, and in this case to the community of farmers that even though you get into problems, problems that everyone can understand and sympathise with, it does not excuse embarking upon a course of criminality such as this which has wider ramifications in the rest of the community in respect of the distribution of drugs. For that reason there has to be a gaol sentence imposed which does reflect the principles of general deterrence."" 
        
       
      
    23 His Honour noted that there was an early plea of guilty and unquestionably Mr Kerr was remorseful. The sentencing Judge was confident that Mr Kerr would never commit another criminal offence. He noted that, at least after his arrest, he was found to be severely depressed when assessed by a psychologist. 
     
      
    24 His Honour found special circumstances arising from the fact that this was Mr Kerr's first time in gaol and that, when released, he would require a longer period under supervision. 
     
      
       
      Submissions by the parties. 
       
      
    25 Mr Boulten SC, for the applicant, did not suggest patent error. His Honour had correctly stated the sentencing principles to be applied. Counsel acknowledged that the offences were serious and that the need for general deterrence ""was high"". Yet, an examination of the sentencing statistics, maintained by the Judicial Commission, and of cases recently decided by this Court, demonstrated, it was submitted, that the sentences imposed were excessively severe. 
     
      
    26 Counsel then analysed each count. The statistics and decided cases were to be considered against the background of an early plea of guilty (attracting a 25% discount) and a very strong subjective case. Count 1 was the charge of cultivating a commercial quantity of cannabis plants. A ""commercial quantity"" is defined by the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (""the Act"") as 250 plants. The threshold for a ""large commercial quantity"" was 1,000 plants. Here there were 366 plants. Assuming a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty, the starting point must have been about 6 years 8 months. That, it was suggested, was simply too high when compared either to the statistics or the principles enunciated in recent cases. Reference was made to R v Godden [2005] NSWCCA 160, a case where the offender was charged with the cultivation of a commercial quantity of cannabis plants (319 plants). The sentence under appeal, imposed in the District Court after a plea of guilty (attracting a discount of 20%), was 3 years and 2 months, with a non parole period of 2 years. That sentence was set aside as too severe, even though the offender had been on a bond at the time of the offence. Hall J (Hunt AJA and Grove J agreeing), after an extensive examination of the statistics and caselaw, said this: (at [35]) 
     
      
       
        
        "" … I am of the opinion that a conclusion that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive is inescapable."" 
        
       
      
    27 The Court substituted a sentence of 2 years and 2 months, with a non parole period of 1 year 3 months, taking account of a Form 1 offence involving a quantity of loose marijuana (cf R v Giammaria & Karagiannis [2006] NSWCCA 63; R v Quan [2006] NSWCCA 382; Hantzis v R  [2006] NSWCCA 387). 
     
      
    28 Moving to count 2, the charge of having supplied a commercial quantity of cannabis, many of the same comments can be made. In determining whether the sentence was excessive, one must take account of the early plea of guilty and the very strong subjective case. Under the Act, a ""commercial quantity"" of cannabis, in the context of a charge of deemed supply, is defined as 25 kilograms. A ""large commercial quantity"" involves the supply of 100 kilograms. Here the cannabis weighed 44.86 kilograms. The statistics in respect of all offenders suggested that most received sentences of 3 years or less. Less than 18% received more than 4-1/2 years. Again it was submitted that his Honour's starting point (6 years 8 months) was simply too high. 
     
      
    29 In responding to these submissions, the Crown drew attention to the fact that his Honour was dealing with three serious offences. He approached the matter in what was termed ""the old fashioned way"", that is, adopting the sentencing practice used before Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. According to the Crown, if the offences were looked at individually, as Pearce required, and appropriate consideration given to questions of accumulation and concurrence, the overall sentence was appropriate. This Court would not be persuaded, therefore, that a lesser sentence was warranted in law (s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912).  
     
      
    30 His Honour, shortly before passing sentence, said this: (ROS 8/9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I should also say that in respect of these offences although there are three separate offences they are really all part of the one commercial operation and for that reason I believe that the same sentence should be passed in respect of each of them, and the sentences should be concurrent."" 
        
       
      
    31 It should be acknowledged at once that, looked at individually, divorced from the companion offences, the sentences imposed appear to be manifestly excessive. However, his Honour chose to make all sentences concurrent. Did this involve a departure from Pearce v The Queen, as the Crown suggested? Should he have fixed lesser sentences on each count and then partially accumulated such sentences? If so, is a lesser sentence than the sentence imposed (5 years with a non parole period of 3 years) warranted in law? 
     
      
    32 Pearce v The Queen certainly marked a departure from previous sentencing practice. Before Pearce, where there were multiple offences, it was customary to select the most serious offence and use it as the vehicle for reflecting the totality of the offender's criminality. Concurrent sentences would be then imposed in respect of the remaining offences. 
     
      
    33 The effect of Pearce v The Queen upon that practice was summarised in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 by Simpson J (Mason P agreeing): (at 67) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[7] … Whether or not to accumulate sentences imposed in relation to multiple offences is, in the end, an exercise of discretion to be made in accordance with established principle. Features common to two or more offences are all matters relevant to be taken into account (pointing towards concurrence) as are features indicating the disparate nature of the offences (pointing the other way). There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong. 
        
       
       
        
        [8] As a result of the decision of the High Court in  
        Pearce 
        , the question of whether to accumulate sentences for multiple offences has taken on a new dimension. Following  
        Pearce 
        , a judge is required to fix 'an appropriate sentence' for each offence, before considering questions of accumulation, concurrence or totality. I take this to mean that, except perhaps in cases of multiple offences committed as part of a single, discrete, episode of criminality, the sentence for an individual offence is the reflect the criminality involved in the offence untainted by reference to the other offences for which that offender is to be sentenced."" 
         
        (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    34 Here, count 1 (cultivation of a commercial quantity of cannabis plants) involved the seizure of 366 cannabis plants on 8 November 2005 during the course of the police search. The plants represented future profits of the commercial venture. Count 2, the seizure of 44.86 kilograms of cannabis, represented a harvest from previous crops. It was available for supply and was, under the Act, deemed to have been supplied. Count 3, the $79,700 cash, one would infer, was the product of cannabis that had been supplied. These offences, although part of the same commercial operation, represented quite different stages of production, and different aspects of Mr Kerr's criminality. After Pearce v The Queen it was not appropriate, I believe, to simply make the sentences concurrent. 
     
      
    35 The applicant was sentenced in respect of three serious charges, each carrying a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The cases and the statistics referred to by counsel for the applicant are of limited assistance, since they do not combine three serious offences, as this case does. The nature and timing of each offence suggested there ought to have been accumulation. In my view, no lesser sentence than imprisonment for 5 years with a non parole period of 3 years was warranted in law. There seems to me no purpose in restructuring the sentences to achieve the same overall result (cf AJO v R [2008] NSWCCA 28 at [33]). 
     
      
       
      Order. 
       
      
    36 I therefore propose that leave to appeal against sentence should be granted, but the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    37 BUDDIN J: I agree with Kirby J.

    2 JAMES J: I also agree with Kirby J. 
     
      
    3 KIRBY J: In October 2006, Jorge Perez (""the appellant"") stood trial before O'Reilly ADCJ and a jury. The Crown alleged that he had a sexual relationship with the complainant, then a child, during a four year period (28 March 2000 to 13 June 2004). According to the Crown, the relationship began when the complainant was 10 years old and continued until she was 14 years. 
     
      
    4 The Crown relied upon five incidents, the last (on 13 June 2004) giving rise to count 5, an alternative count 5A, and count 6. The indictment against Mr Perez can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        That between 28.3.00 and 31.12.00 he committed an aggravated indecent assault against a child aged 10 years, contrary to s 61M(1)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900; maximum penalty: imprisonment for 7 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2 
        : That between 28.3.01 and 28.3.02 he committed an aggravated indecent assault against a child aged 11 years, contrary to s 61M(1)

        1900. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 
        : That between 28.3.01 and 31.12.01 he committed aggravated sexual intercourse (that is,  
        without consent 
        ) with a child aged 11 years, contrary to s 61J  
        Crimes Act 
         1900; maximum penalty: imprisonment for 20 years. 
         
         
        Count 3A: (in the alternative) 
         
        That between 28.3.01 and 31.12.01 he had sexual intercourse with a child aged 11 years, contrary to s 66C(1)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900; maximum penalty: imprisonment for 8 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4 
        : That between 28.3.02 and 30.6.03 he committed aggravated sexual intercourse (that is,  
        without consent 
        ) with a child aged 12 years, contrary to s 61J  
        Crimes Act  
        1900. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 4A: (in the alternative) 
         
         That between 28.3.02 and 30.6.03 he had sexual intercourse with a child aged about 12 years, contrary to s 66C(1)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5 
        : That on 13.6.04 he attempted sexual intercourse with a child aged 14 years, contrary to s 66D

         That on 13.6.04 he committed an aggravated indecent assault upon a child aged 14 years, contrary to s 61M(1)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 6 
        : That on 13.6.04 he committed a further aggravated indecent assault upon a child aged 14 years, contrary to s 61M(1)  
        Crimes Act 
          
        1900. 
        
       
      
    5 Mr Perez pleaded not guilty to each count. After a trial lasting about one week he was found not guilty of counts 3, 4, 5, 5A and 6. He was convicted on the remaining counts (counts 1, 2, 3A and 4A). He was thereafter sentenced by O'Reilly ADCJ to a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non parole period of 5-1/2 years, the sentence being as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Counts 1 and 2 
         (aggravated indecent assault): 
         
        Imprisonment for 7 years commencing 26.6.06 and expiring on 25.6.13, with a non parole period of 5 years between 26.6.06 and 25.6.11. 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 3A and 4A 
         (sexual intercourse with a child) 
         
        Imprisonment for 6 years commencing 25.12.06, with a non parole period of 5 years (25.12.06 to 24.12.11). 
        
       
      
    6 Before dealing with the grounds of appeal, I should describe the evidence presented during the trial, including the evidence in respect of counts where the appellant was acquitted. 
     
      
       
      The evidence at trial. 
       
      
    7 The appellant came to Australia approximately 20 years ago. His native tongue is Spanish. Once in Australia, he met the complainant's family, who likewise spoke Spanish, they having come to Australia some years before. Mr Perez and the complainant's parents became friends. He frequently visited their home. The complainant knew him as ""a family friend"".  
     
      
    8 During the year 2000, when the complainant was 10 years old, her parents separated. Her father left the family home. The complainant and her mother remained at the family home, as did her brother who was much older. In the years that followed (before June 2004) others periodically moved into and out of the house for short periods, including a cousin and her partner, as well as the complainant's maternal grandmother. The complainant's brother also moved out for a time and later returned. 
     
      
    9 After the complainant's parents separated, Mr Perez continued to come to the family home. He worked for a building company operated by the father. The complainant's brother worked for the same company. According to Mr Perez (ERISP Q85), throughout 2000 and until December 2001, the truck he was required to drive for the company was parked at the family home. Each day he would pick it up from that location and return it at the end of the day. It was also common ground that, even when that job finished (in December 2001), and before mid June 2004, he came to the family home regularly. 
     
      
    10 The allegations against Mr Perez came to the notice of the police on Wednesday 16 June 2004, as a result of a telephone call from the complainant's brother. The complainant wrote an undated note to her brother, which was in these terms: (Ex D) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I hope you don't get angry with me but I have something important to tell you. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I have had sex with Jorge since I was ten, please don't tell mom or dad & don't kill him just cause of rage. Your (sic) the only one I have told & please don't be upset with me. 
         
        please help me, I feel so alone & helples (sic)."" 
        
       
      
    11 Arrangements were made the same day (16.6.04) for a medical examination by Dr Norrie, a doctor experienced in the examination of persons said to have been sexually assaulted. Dr Norrie obtained a history from the complainant. The history suggested that the last assault by Mr Perez was on Sunday 13 June 2004, although it had not involved penetration. 
     
      
    12 The complainant, however, said that there had been penetration on earlier occasions. A physical examination was then undertaken. Dr Norrie's report included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""This genital medical examination, 3 days after an alleged sexual assault, showed there was a healed partial thickness hymeneal transection. This may have occurred as a postpubertal traumatic injury but may have occurred prepubertally. There were no acute changes except for some non-specific genital redness. This medical examination is consistent with the history given by (the complainant) of vaginal penetration by a blunt object such as a penis."" 
        
       
      
    13 The complainant told Dr Norrie that there had been no accidental injury to the external genitalia, which was confirmed by the complainant's mother`. In cross examination Dr Norrie said she thought that the injury to the hymen was an ""old injury"". The reddening was probably caused by irritation or inflammation or a chemical allergy. 
     
      
    14 On 23 June 2004, the complainant was interviewed by the police. The interview was recorded by video. The video became the complainant's evidence in chief at trial. The complainant was able to fix the time of five incidents, which became the subject of the various counts in the indictment set out above. 
     
      
    15 On 22 July 2004, the police interviewed Mr Perez. They put to him the complainant's allegations, which he denied. The ERISP of that interview was played as part of the Crown case. The appellant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    16 The complainant said that the first incident occurred between her tenth birthday (28 March 2000) and Christmas that year (count 1). The appellant came to the house whilst her family was out. He took her by the arm and led her to the study. Once in the study he pulled down her pants. He then rubbed his erect penis on the outside of her vagina. Shortly after, he put his hand under her top and touched her breasts. The interview included the following questions: (p26) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q215 Right. How did you feel when he was doing this? 
         
        A. Weird. 
        
       
       
        
        Q216 In what way? 
         
        A I don't, I didn't know what was going on, I didn't know what the hell he was doing, I just felt, like a bit shocked and didn't know what was going on."" 
        
       
      
    17 This episode became the charge of aggravated indecent assault in count 1 in respect of which Mr Perez was convicted. 
     
      
    18 The second incident occurred when the complainant was 11 years old. She said that the appellant came to her home. No-one else was at home. They were outside in an area which she referred to as ""the foyer"" or ""the garage"". She told the police that he removed her pants and pushed her up against a brick wall. He undid his trousers and began rubbing his erect penis against her vagina, holding her by the waist, simulating intercourse. Again, on her account, he told her not to tell anyone what had happened, or indeed that he had been there. The episode was the aggravated indecent assault in count 2. The appellant was found guilty. 
     
      
    19 The third incident, according to the complainant, also occurred when she was 11 years old. She thought that it happened during term 4, towards the end of the school year. Again no-one was home. She said she and the appellant were in the garage. She was standing alongside her brother's ute, which she said was white. The appellant was in front of her and pulled her pants down. He took a condom from his pocket, which he put on his erect penis. He then guided his penis towards her vagina which he penetrated, moving back and forth (Q369-370). The complainant described what happened in these words: (p44) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q371 OK. How long did that go for? 
         
        A. Not long really, because it hurt and I went, no, and tried to push him. 
        
       
       
        
        Q372 M'mm. And what happened when you said no and tried to push him? 
         
        A. He had a puzzled look on his face. 
        
       
       
        
        Q373 M'mm. 
         
        A And --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q374 Did he do anything? 
         
        A. Hm? 
        
       
       
        
        Q375 Did you do anything? 
         
        A. I was crying, so he held me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q376 M'mm. 
         
        A. And he was trying to calm me down."" 
        
       
      
    20 This incident became the subject of the charge of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child (that is, without consent) in count 3, and the alternative charge of sexual intercourse with a child, count 3A (where consent is not an element). The jury returned a verdict of not guilty in respect of count 3 and guilty of count 3A. 
     
      
    21 The fourth incident was said to have occurred when the complainant was about 12 years old. She was in year 7 at school. She and the appellant were at home alone. However, she said her mother was out shopping and was expected home. The appellant guided her to a couch from which he could look out the window. He wished to check whether the mother had returned. She said he pulled her pants down. He lay on top of her and inserted his penis in her vagina (Q408). Intercourse took place for about five minutes. The incident occurred at a time when her brother had moved out of home. 
     
      
    22 The fourth incident was the foundation for count 4, aggravated sexual intercourse with a child (that is, without consent) and count 4A, sexual intercourse with a child. The jury, as with count 3, was clearly not satisfied on the issue of consent. It returned a verdict of not guilty in respect of count 4 and guilty in respect of count 4A. 
     
      
    23 According to the complainant, the appellant had a girlfriend when the complainant was about 13 years old and therefore left her alone. 
     
      
    24 The final incident was date specific. On the Crown case, a series of assaults occurred on Sunday 13 June 2004, the indictment so alleged. The assaults were said to have occurred shortly before the complainant wrote the note to her brother, who then drew the matter to the attention of the police. The complainant was 14 years old at the time. She explained that her mother was at the hospital because the complainant's grandmother was gravely ill. No-one else was home apart from Mario Ferero, who was fixing gyprock on an extension to the house. The extension was separate from the house. Mario Ferero, incidentally, was not called to give evidence. Evidence was given that he had left Australia and was overseas. 
     
      
    25 The complainant alleged that the appellant took her to her mother's bedroom. He then removed her pants and told her to lie on the bed. He then rubbed his erect penis against her vagina. In the police interview, the complainant described what happened in these terms: (p58) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A491 And he just, after, like two minutes of him just putting his penis outside and up and down --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q492 M'mm. 
         
        A --- he, no, yeah, he was, like against, he, he was trying to put it in. 
        
       
       
        
        Q493 M'mm. 
         
        A That time, but he, he just ended up getting at the skin on the outside and he kept on dragging it."" 
        
       
      
    26 This was the assault, on the Crown case, giving rise to count 5, the attempted sexual intercourse with a child, and the alternative, count 5A, aggravated indecent assault upon a child. It will remembered that the appellant was acquitted of both charges. 
     
      
    27 The complainant asserted that, having failed to have intercourse, the appellant then rolled her over so that she was on her stomach. He put his penis between her buttocks and ultimately ejaculated. This allegation gave rise to count 6, aggravated indecent assault upon a child, in respect of which the appellant was also acquitted. 
     
      
    28 The complainant's mother gave evidence that she had received a telephone call from the hospital that her mother was dying. She got the call, on her recollection, on 13 June 2004, the day before her mother died. Before leaving for the hospital she phoned the appellant. She asked him to come to the house to keep an eye on the complainant because her son was out playing soccer. The mother gave evidence that she arrived home at 10.00 pm that day, Sunday 13 June 2004. 
     
      
    29 The appellant, when interviewed by the police, acknowledged that the complainant's mother had called him. He said this: (ERISP p16) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q96 OK. Well, it's alleged that you were at the house on the 13th of June, because (the complainant's) mother rang you and said, 'I'm at the hospital and you go to our house and look after (the complainant) because there's a handyman there working.' Do you remember that? Did you go to the house then? 
         
        A. When the mother, grandmother die, you know, yeah, (the mother), she, she call me from the hospital, you know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q97. Yeah. 
         
        A. Grandmother die at 1.30, she call me maybe 2 o'clock and she, she told me, you know, 'Go to, to my house, you know, because Mario is a carpenter working, doing some renovation. And I said (the complainant) there and my son, …, you know.'"" 
        
       
      
    30 The grandmother died at about 1.00 pm on Monday 14 June 2004. If the appellant's version were accurate, his visit to the house and the suggested offence, must have occurred on Monday 14 June, not Sunday 13 June as alleged in the indictment. This was an important issue during the trial, which I will come back to when examining one of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    31 Let me turn to the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal. 
       
      
    32 The notice of appeal is a lengthy document identifying four alleged grounds referable to the convictions and two grounds relating to sentence. In substance the grounds can be paraphrased as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 
        : The trial miscarried because the Crown prosecutor incorrectly and unfairly misdescribed one of the exhibits, suggesting that the appellant had lied in respect of it. 
        
       
       
        
      Ground 2 
      : The  
      Longman 
        
      warning concerning delay was inadequate. 
       
       
        
      Ground 3 
      : The  
      Markuleski 
       direction concerning the complainant's credibility was wrong and misleading. 
       
       
        
      Ground 4 
      : The verdicts were inconsistent, such that the guilty verdicts cannot stand. 
       
       
        
      Ground 5 
      : (on sentence) The trial Judge wrongly assumed that there was a standard non parole period in respect of the offences in counts 1 and 2. 
       
       
        
      Ground 6 
      : (on sentence) The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    33 I will deal with each ground in turn. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Misstatement by the Crown suggesting the appellant had lied. 
       
      
    34 It will be remembered that, on the Crown case, the first three incidents occurred in the period between 28 March 2000 and 31 December 2001 (counts 1, 2, 3 and 3A). The appellant, when interviewed by the police in relation to these offences, denied any wrongdoing saying, in effect, that he was working seven days a week and very long hours. He therefore had no opportunity to commit these crimes. He said this: (ERISP p11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A80. Because I have thought I lost my shop you know, in, yeah, in January 2000, I think, you know. I don't go for 3 months, I start working 14 hour a day with his father in that time, in March or April, I can't remember exactly what month."" 
        
       
      
    35 After a description of the complainant's allegations in respect of the third incident been had provided to him, Mr Perez said this: (ERISP p13) 
     
      
       
        
        ""A84 No. I'm very confused with this story. This here story, I don't know, how something, a book or something like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q85 And what is it that confuses you about it? 
         
        A. First thing, first thing when I just start working with (the complainant's) father was in March or April 2001. OK. I, I workin' 10 hour, 12 hour, 14 hour sometimes, I pass too many everyday for his house, … because I need my ute in that house, in (the complainant's) house, no. In the morning I pick it up the truck I working all day with the truck, in the afternoon I leave the truck and pick up my ute, you know, well, his father, his mother, too many people and I don't know, I don't know."" 
        
       
      
    36 The complainant's brother was the manager of his father's building company. When he was cross examined, he was shown 14 payslips of Mr Perez', seven relating to the year 2000 and seven relating to the year 2001. The earliest from 2000 was dated 27 April 2000 (Exhibit 2) and the last for 2001 was dated 6 December 2001 (Exhibit 3). They recorded irregular hours, usually seven days a week. According to the appellant, the mean number of hours each week was 68.17. The complainant's brother agreed at first that the appellant had worked for his father's company from mid April 2000 until the company ran out of work in December 2001. Once shown the documents, however, he doubted their authenticity, pointing out that they were not signed (although provision was made for a signature) and that the company logo was different. He stated that, on reflection, he was ""fairly certain"" that Mr Perez was no longer working for the company in 2001. The Crown, in his final address, made the following submission in relation to this material: (31.10.06: T4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In my submission you would not accept what the accused has said in his record of interview as being sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt. …"" 
        
       
      
    37 The Crown continued: (T4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In my submission to you he was untruthful in that record of interview.  
        It may only be a minor matter 
        , but he says he worked for (the complainant's father) in 2001, says that at question 85. Well you know from the records that have been put into evidence through (the brother) that he actually worked there in 2000.  
        You may think that's not a big thing but it's clearly untrue 
        . He was at pains to say that he had no opportunity to be with (the complainant). Early on he said 'Well look how could I? I was working ten, 12, 14 hour days. Maybe it was 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning I might have had time.' I mean he puts up as his explanation he didn't have time to commit the offences. … "" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    38 It was submitted that the Crown prosecutor had misstated the evidence (suggesting he had not worked for the company in 2001) and his misstatement was fundamental. The misstatement was the basis for the suggestion that the appellant had lied in his answers to the police. It was acknowledged that, since no complaint had been made to the trial Judge, leave would be required under Rule 4. It was submitted that leave should be given because the misstatement had caused the trial to miscarry. 
     
      
    39 The Crown answered these submissions by suggesting, first, that the Crown had not misstated the evidence. The brother, when cross examined, had ultimately doubted that the appellant had been working for his father's company in 2001, notwithstanding the payslips. Alternatively, the Crown said that if there had been a misstatement, it was a minor matter, and had been so described by the Crown prosecutor in his address. It certainly did not cause the trial to miscarry. Leave should be refused (R4). 
     
      
    40 Here, the payslips, Exhibits 2 and 3, appear to be authentic, notwithstanding the brother's evidence. I am prepared to assume that the Crown inadvertently misstated the evidence, and incorrectly suggested that the material provided a basis for inferring that the appellant had lied about working in 2001 for the father's company. Was the mistake fundamental, as the appellant has suggested, or was it, as the Crown said to the jury, ""only a minor matter"" and that the jury may think ""that's not a big thing""? Was there the possibility of a miscarriage of justice? 
     
      
    41 A number of observations should be made concerning the payslips and their relevance to the question of the appellant having no opportunity to commit the offences charged. First, Mr Perez' case, at its highest, suggested that he had been employed and was working long hours in the years 2000/2001, whereas the indictment extended from March 2000 to 13 June 2004. Secondly, the records of the company, relied upon to prove the absence of opportunity, did not cover the whole period 2000/2001. They were a sample, with seven payslips from each year. Thirdly, the payslips, far from establishing no opportunity, demonstrated that on many occasions Mr Perez finished work quite early and, often finished after only two or three hours work. It was clear that he had not worked 10 or 12 hours a day, as suggested in the record of interview. There were opportunities, in terms of his working hours, to visit the complainant's home, had he wished. Further, he had said to the police that he picked up his truck from outside the complainant's home each day and parked it there each night. He also acknowledged in the same interview that he did work at the complainant's house, which included cleaning, cutting the grass, tiling and other jobs (Q181-185). On any view, therefore, the wage material did not exclude opportunity, although it was relevant to counts 1, 2 and 3A in respect of which Mr Perez was convicted. 
     
      
    42 That being the context, it is significant that counsel for Mr Perez immediately answered and corrected the Crown misstatement. He said this: (31.10.06: T9) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Now the Crown said something which I must say I'm a little confused about in terms of the accused's record of interview. In the accused's record of interview as was the case when (the brother) was being cross-examined by me it was suggested to him, and indeed shown to him in the form of exhibits 2 and 3, that the accused worked for (the father's company) from 2000 until the end of 2001.  
        Now I may have misheard the Crown when he referred to page 5 of the interview that he ceased work in 2001 but when you examine, and no doubt you will examine, the invoices or the working records it shows that the first invoice in 2001 commences the week 5/1/01 and goes through to the end of 6 December 2001. 
         Now this was a document produced by the accused to counter any suggestion that he had carte blanche access to her, as it were. He worked with the father of (sic) the company, he worked with (the brother), the hours speak for themselves. This was either an individual who was able to synchronise his movements in and out of the house to make sure that it was the right time that (the complainant) was home, and again we don't know these times, the right time that she was at home on a particular day of the week, and if it wasn't the day of the week, the right time during the weekend when no-one would be home, when grandma wouldn't be home perhaps. This was a person that was able to synchronise so that he wouldn't be caught out by the father who utilised the foyer/garage area for storage of building material."" (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    43 The jury was provided with the exhibit. It would have been immediately apparent that Exhibit 3 contained payslips for 2001. Counsel for Mr Perez sought no further direction from the trial Judge. The prosecutor's mistake did not, in my view, give rise to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    44 I would refuse leave under Rule 4 in respect of ground 1.

        "" 
        Appeal Against Conviction: 
         There was a miscarriage of justice as a result of the learned Trial Judge's failure to relate and link his direction warning the jury of the need to be persuaded of the truth and accuracy of the evidence of the complainant to his comment to the jury as to the effect of delay in the trial, the trial Judge failed to use language of warning in delivering the portion of his summing up concerning the disadvantages suffered by the accused where there as delay in complaint. 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The Trial Judge failed to use language which showed that his words in the issue bore the weight and authority of the court, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) The Trial Judge failed to adequately inform the jury of the inability of the accused to test the evidence of the complainant caused by such delay in the circumstances of the trial which included: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) The inability of the complainant at trial to provide a time frame for the said offences, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) The uncertainty of the periods of unemployment and hours of work performed by the Appellant on behalf of the complainant's brother in the relevant periods and the lack of records relating thereto, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) The inability, due to the effluxion of time to ascertain the precise times that other persons resided at premises occupied by the complainant during the timeframe of the alleged offences."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    46 Let me first examine what was said by his Honour in the summing up. He drew attention to the fundamental importance of the complainant's evidence. He said this: (SU: 5/6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""As a matter of commonsense, you will appreciate that there is one witness in this case who is essential to the proof of the crown case and that is (the complainant). There are - subject to two other matters which I will mention shortly. One is the letter to the brother, I will come back to that and the other is the evidence given by Doctor Norrie but those other matters, in a sense, pale into insignificance when one considers the fundamental question."" 
        
       
      
    47 There followed what may be termed a ""Murray direction"" (R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19), given in conventional terms: (SU: 6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There is no doubt that (the complainant's) evidence is essential to the proof of the crown case. You would need to, and you should, examine and scrutinise her evidence with great care before you decide whether you accept her evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Since it is for the crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the evidence given by that witness, is the only evidence relating to essential matters which the crown must prove and it follows that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you should accept the evidence of (the complainant) otherwise the accused must be found not guilty."" 
        
       
      
    48 His Honour reminded the jury that it must examine, not only the complainant's honesty, but her reliability (SU: 6). He then foreshadowed a direction on delay, which he would come to shortly. He said this: (SU: 6/7) 
     
      
       
        
        ""On the other hand, the defence argues that there has been a long delay and I will give you a direction about that. Most of these events happened some three or four years before the police came into it. I will give you a direction about that and the crown submits that you would, as I have said, you would rely on (the complainant). It is not for the accused to show that she is either dishonest or unreliable."" 
        
       
      
    49 His Honour then dealt with other issues, including the fact that the appellant had not given evidence, and that the complainant had given her evidence in chief by video. He then returned to the issue of delay. The summing up proceeded as follows: (SU: 11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""You have heard evidence then that on or about that date I just mentioned, 14 June 04, the complainant wrote that letter to her brother. Mr Nematalla (counsel for Mr Perez) has made some submissions to you about delay and its result on his case and I will come to that in a moment."" 
         
        (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    50 The summing up continued: (SU: 11/12) 
     
      
       
        
        ""So far as the events charged in relation to 13 June 04 are concerned, you can have regard to the terms of that complaint as being consistent, if that is the view you take, as being consistent with the complainant's evidence. That approach does not come into operation in respect of the four earlier events, that is to say events charged in counts 1, 2, 3, 3A, 4 and 4A because of the delay factor and the reason for that is that the complaints were made so long after the event and it is the law that late complaint in this particular case has deprived Mr Perez of the ability to test (the complainant's) truthfulness by reference to recent events. 
        
       
       
        
        For example, had there been an immediate complaint, there could well have been medical examination which would have assisted in up-to-date objective evidence about whether there was any sign of injury - fresh injury to the genitalia. 
        
       
       
        
        Additionally, of course, where there is a delay of some years, one loses the opportunity to turn up diaries and other contemporaneous material which might assist in cross examination. It might also assist in alibi defences I suppose or assist in at least determining where the accused was from time to time."" 
        
       
      
    51 His Honour thereafter began dealing with each count. Before concluding the summing up there was an adjournment (SU: 17). During the adjournment, counsel for Mr Perez raised a number of issues. He was well prepared. He had a document which was marked MFI 6, which set out the directions he was seeking. These directions included a Longman direction. Counsel raised with his Honour the need for a direction concerning the failure of the complainant to complain in respect of all but the last incident. In that context, the following exchange occurred: (SU: 18) 
     
      
       
        
        ""HIS HONOUR: I thought I'd said that -- 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: In very great detail, you told them you wouldn't be able to turn up documents, check diary entries, check witnesses. You said it very clearly your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: -- Longman, isn't it? 
        
       
       
        
        NEMATALLA: Well that's a Longman your Honour. What I'm asking is, in terms of Johnson. We're talking about credibility as opposed to disadvantages your Honour and this is not just splitting hairs, the Court of Criminal Appeal specifically turned its mind to the issue of credibility in Johnson's case. 
        
       
       
        
        Now if your Honour's obviously of the same view as my friend, I can't take the matter further but  
        you certainly gave the Longman direction 
         but not in terms of what I've requested in point 2."" 
         
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    52 Point 2 of MFI 6 was concerned not with Longman, but Johnson. Counsel's note was in these terms: (MFI 6) 
     
      
       
        
        ""2. In addition to the statutory direction as to the absence or delay in complaint (s294  
        Criminal Procedure Act 
         1986) the Jury should be directed that in evaluating the evidence of the Complainant and in determining whether to believe her, it could take into account her failure to make a complaint at the earliest reasonable opportunity as reducing her credibility (see  
        Johnson 
         (1998) 45 NSWLR 362)."" 
        
       
      
    53 His Honour thereafter resumed the summing up. He gave the Johnson direction as requested. He also included a commentary upon counsel's submissions. In the context of the defence submissions, he said this: (SU: 22/23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Mr Nematalla (counsel for Mr Perez) said to you, quite accurately, that suspicion plays no part in these matters, put that completely aside. The onus rests on the crown and the standard of proof required is beyond reasonable doubt.  
        He made the criticisms based on delay, I think I have dealt with that already, I do not think I need go through that again. There is no doubt that where there is a delay of some years in reporting these matters there is no doubt whatever that the accused is under a disadvantage in a number of respects, not the least of which is being able to turn up diary entries and the like, perhaps locating alibi type witnesses, et cetera.  
         He made the criticism based on the number of comings and goings of other people around the house, that what seemed to be happening was that the accused would need to synchronise his movements to perhaps reverse correspond with the arrivals and departures of others into and around the house."" 
         
        (parenthesis and emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    54 His Honour added: (SU: 23) 
     
      
       
        
        ""He criticised the complainant for her lack of recollection of the events which are the subject of count 3 because this was the first occasion where full intercourse apparently took place. In his submission the complainant should have been able to provide more detail in that respect. … "" 
        
       
      
    55 Against that background, the appellant says that the Longman direction was not adequate. It fell far short of the suggested direction in the Bench Book. There was no real warning. His Honour did not tell the jury how delay was relevant to their assessment of the Crown case. The written submissions of the appellant included the following: (Appellant's Subs: p11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""In short such a warning needs to focus the Jury on an examination and assessment of the complaints evidence and have regard to the limitations that now exist to test or contradict the same because of the effluxion of time. It is submitted the essential link was missing in the Trial Judge's comment."" 
        
       
      
    56 The delay in respect of count 1 was approximately four years. It was submitted that the appellant had been disadvantaged by delay in a number of ways that made a warning appropriate. First, the opportunity to commit the crime depended, in part, upon his working hours four years before, which were uncertain. Secondly, there was the related issue, also relevant to opportunity, concerned with those living in the house at any given time. People moved in and out of the house, including the complainant's father and brother. It was difficult after so many years to be precise as to their movements. Thirdly, there was uncertainty as to when each offence had been committed, again in part the product of delay. The prosecution had been obliged to frame all counts, apart from the last three, as covering a span of time. The complainant frankly acknowledged in cross examination that she ""was not good at remembering dates"". The fourth aspect concerned the evidence of Dr Norrie. Dr Norrie said the partially ruptured hymen was an old injury. However, she was unable to say when it had occurred (26.10.06: T33).  
     
      
    57 The Crown responded by drawing attention to the relatively short delay between the alleged offences and the time Mr Perez had been apprised of the complainant's allegations, the latter date being important to the potential prejudice suffered by him (Crampton v The Queen [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161 at 211 at [140]; JJB v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 126; (2006) 161 A Crim R 187 at [64]). The delay, expressed in approximate terms because all but counts 5, 5A and 6 involved a span of time, can be summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1 
        : About 4 years. 
        
       
       
        
      Counts 2 & 3 
      : About 3 years. 
       
       
        
      Count 4 
      : Between 1 and 2 years. 
       
       
        
      Counts 5 & 6 
      : Prompt complaint. 
       
      
    58 The jury, according to the Crown, was warned. His Honour said, ""It is the law that late complaint in this particular case has deprived Mr Perez of the ability to test (the complainant's) truthfulness by reference to recent events"" (SU: 11). ""Recent events"", in that context, meant ""contemporaneous events"". The jury had already been told of the need for caution (""You should examine and scrutinise her evidence with great care."") shortly before, although not immediately before. His Honour described particular difficulties which Mr Perez faced caused by delay. According to the Crown, the warning his Honour gave was stronger than that in other cases where there had been comparable delay, such as DPW v R [2006] NSWCCA 295; (2006) 164 A Crim R 583 (where the delay was one month short of four years). 
     
      
    59 Finally, the Crown emphasised that counsel for Mr Perez made no complaint at the trial. Counsel was in a much better position to judge the ""temperature"" of the trial and the need for further directions. Indeed, counsel said to his Honour during the summing up that he was satisfied with the Longman directions that had been given. Rule 4 applies. There was, according to the Crown, no miscarriage. Leave should be refused. 
     
      
    60 Three issues should be examined: 
     
      
    · First, was a Longman warning necessary having regard to the delay in respect of counts 1 to 4A? 
     
      
    · Secondly, assuming a warning was required, or required in respect of one or more counts, what needed to be said? 
     
      
    · Thirdly, having regard to these requirements, did the summing up involve error? 
     
      
    61 Dealing with the first of these issues, it should be noted that the Longman warning was formulated in the context of gross delay, that is, delay of more than 20 years (Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79). In the cases that followed, where the High Court re-emphasised the importance of the warning, the delay in each case was at least significant (Crampton v The Queen (19 years delay) [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161; Doggett v The Queen (12 to 19 years delay) [2001] HCA 46; (2001) 208 CLR 343). The court emphasised that a warning was important because the disadvantage to the accused may be obvious to a judge, who had the benefit of the accumulated experience of courts, but not obvious to a jury (Longman (supra) at 91 (Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ)). The jury therefore needed to be told of that experience. 
     
      
    62 It is worth pausing, momentarily, to consider the nature of the disadvantage to the accused where there is significant delay. In Crampton v The Queen, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ said this: (at 181) 
     
      
       
        
        ""45. … An accused's defence will frequently be an outright denial of the allegations. That is not a reason for disparaging the relevance and importance of a timely opportunity to test the evidence of a complainant, to locate other witnesses, and to try to recollect precisely what the accused was doing on the occasion in question. In short, the denial to an accused of the forensic weapons that reasonable contemporaneity provides constitutes a significant disadvantage which a judge must recognise and to which an unmistakable and firm voice must be given by appropriate directions. …"" 
        
       
      
    63 In R v WRC [2002] NSWCCA 210; (2002) 130 A Crim R 89, the following was said: (at 138) 
     
      
       
        
        "" The potency of cross examination as a means of exposing unreliable evidence diminishes significantly with time. In 
         Saporen  
        (1939) 205 Minn 358 (quoted in  
        McCormick on Evidence 
        , 2nd Ed (1972), page 602), the following was said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'The chief merit of cross-examination is not that at some future time it gives the party opponent the right to dissect adverse testimony. Its principal virtue is the immediate application of the testing process. Its strokes fall while the iron is hot. False testimony is apt to harden and become unyielding to the blows of truth in proportion as the witness has opportunity for reconsideration and influence by the suggestions of others. ...' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The method of cross examination is an attack upon detail, exposing contradictions and unreliability. If the trial is undertaken within a reasonable time, the excuse for unreliability of fading memory is unlikely to be persuasive. However, where the trial is delayed, the accused is disadvantaged in two ways. First, the testimony is likely to be more vague, bereft of the detail which may be used to expose unreliability. Secondly, that absence of detail, and any contradiction that may happen to emerge, can the more easily be explained by reference to the passage of time. The jury therefore is more likely to be forgiving of shortcomings in the complainant's evidence, especially in the context of charges which arouse strong feelings of prejudice or revulsion: (compare Kirby J in  
        Doggett 
         (at 440, [118]))."" 
         
        
       
      
    64 In DRE v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 280; (2006) 164 A Crim R 400, the delay was a matter of months on some counts and up to three years on others. Spigelman CJ described the case as ""at best a borderline case for a Longman warning"" (at [4]). In DPW v R [2006] NSWCCA 295; (2006) 164 A Crim R 583, the appellant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault upon a 12 year old girl. At the time of the alleged offence, the appellant had a relationship with the girl's mother and was living in the same house. It was the Crown case that the offence had taken place on 25 October 2000 after the complainant had attended a school dance. She said the appellant came into her room, took off her shorts, and as he did so inserted his finger into her vagina. She did not, however, tell her mother until March 2004. There was further delay before the allegation was brought to the appellant's attention. The delay was one month short of four years. The trial judge purported to give a Longman warning. It was submitted by the appellant that the direction fell so far short of the requirements of Longman that there had been a miscarriage of justice. The Court (Hunt AJA, Barr and Johnson JJ), however, dismissed the appeal. It approached the matter upon the assumption that a Longman direction was required. However, the extent of the delay was material to the terms of the warning which was necessary. I will return to the Court's reasoning when considering ""the second issue"", that is, the content of the warning. 
     
      
    65 Shortly after DPW v R, the High Court handed down its decision in Tully v The Queen [2006] HCA 56; (2006) 167 A Crim R 192. It was an appeal against conviction in respect of a number of sexual offences where the complainant was aged between nine and ten years at the time of each alleged offence. She had not complained for some two and a quarter years. The trial was then delayed for several years so that it took place four to five years after the conduct giving rise to the charges. No Longman direction was sought, nor given. On appeal, it was argued that the particular facts, involving such a young complainant, required a warning both in terms of Longman v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 79 and Robinson v The Queen [1999] HCA 42; (1999) 197 CLR 162. The majority (Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ) dismissed the appeal. Kirby and Hayne JJ would have allowed the appeal, although Kirby J agreed that a Longman warning was not required. Callinan J said this: (at [132]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[132] … I am unable, however, to find that there were facts or circumstances in this case, or in the conduct of it, and having regard particularly to the appellant's failure to ask for it, that demanded that a  
        Longman 
         direction be given. … "" 
        
       
      
    66 Crennan J (Heydon J agreeing) emphasised that, in circumstances of delay, not being gross delay, the calculus for determining whether a warning was required was rather more complex. Her Honour said this: (at [179]-[180]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[179] Not unnaturally, the practical application of  
        Longman 
         in some trial situations has not always proved easy, particularly in respect of clarifying how great a delay might give rise to an imperative to give a warning. As stated in  
        Doggett 
         this is not a question purely of mathematical precision. Further, there is a distinction to be made between an inexplicable delay in reporting (as in  
        Robinson 
        ) and an explicable delay as here, which may elicit comment but not necessarily require a warning ( 
        Longman 
        ). Intermediate courts of appeal have essayed various distillations of the principles to be applied to particular cases at hand. 
        
       
       
        
        [180] As the reasons of the majority in  
        Longman 
         make clear, it is not imperative to give a warning because the circumstances include allegations of sexual misconduct or because the complainant is young at the time of the events alleged (or at trial) or because there is some delay in complaint to, for example, a mother. While the purpose of a warning in accordance with  
        Longman 
         is to ensure a fair trial and to avoid a miscarriage of justice, the purpose of the relevant legislation is to ensure balance in jury instruction, without proscribing warnings when it is in the interests of justice to give them."" 
         
        (footnotes omitted) 
         
        
       
      
    67 Her Honour added: (at [184]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[184] No forensic disadvantage of a kind which a jury may not appreciate arises automatically because of delay, or because the evidence is uncorroborated evidence of sexual misconduct, or because of the complainant's youth."" 
         
        (footnotes omitted) 
        
       
      
    68 Part of the explanation for the delay was that the appellant had threatened the complainant on a number of occasions, even showing her guns. The complainant said that, but for these threats, she would have told her mother earlier (at [183]). Crennan J, in this context, concluded her judgment as follows: (at [186]-[187]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[186] There was no forensic disadvantage to the appellant, arising out of the explained delay, which would have been palpable or obvious to the trial judge, but would not have been apparent to the jury. The concatenation of circumstances, being the age of the complainant at the time of the offences and at trial, the sexual nature of the offences, the explained delay between the offences and report, and trial, and inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence, could all be evaluated by the jury in the light of their own experiences. Therefore, it was not necessary for the trial judge to give a warning to avoid a miscarriage of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        Conclusions 
        
       
       
        
        [187] I agree with Callinan J that there was nothing in the circumstances of this case which made it imperative for the trial judge to give a warning in accordance with  
        Longman 
        . I also agree with his Honour that there were no errors in relation to the trial judge's directions which could have led to a miscarriage of justice and I agree that the appeal should be dismissed."" 
        
       
      
    69 Turning to the minority judgments, Kirby J believed that there was a need for a warning in accordance with Robinson v The Queen (which was concerned with a complaint by an eight year old child). On the question of a Longman warning, his Honour said this: (at [60])  
     
      
       
        
        ""[60]  
          
        Inapplicability of  
        Longman 
         warning 
        : 
         In this appeal, I would not have disturbed the jury's verdicts, or the convictions that followed, on the basis of an omission on the part of the trial judge to give a warning to the jury of the kind required by  
        Longman v The Queen 
        . That is a decision that concerns (as many others have) the particular problem, in certain cases of complaints of sexual offences, of very long delays between the time of the alleged offences and the first complaint and subsequent trial. Such was not this case.  
        Longman 
         is thus a distracting red herring. Whatever directions were sought at trial, at the hearing of the appeal in this court the appellant's counsel agreed that the appeal was  
        not 
         about a  
        Longman 
         warning. Accordingly,  
        Longman 
        , as such, was not an issue before this court."" 
        
       
       (footnotes omitted) 
       
      
    70 Hayne J likewise believed a warning was appropriate. He said this: (at [89]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[89] … What  
        Robinson 
        , and  
        Longman 
        , hold is that there are cases where there is a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice if the jury is not warned of the need to scrutinise the evidence of a complainant with care before arriving at a conclusion of guilt. … "" 
        
       
       (footnotes omitted) 
       
      
    71 His Honour added the following: (at [90]) 
     
      
       
        
        ""[90] Lengthy delay in making a complaint is often an important reason for concluding that a warning should be given. But as  
        Robinson 
         shows, delay measured in decades (as it was in  
        Longman 
        ) is not the only reason for concluding that it is appropriate in the interests of justice to warn a jury of the dangers of acting on the uncorroborated evidence of a complainant. That is why the convenient shorthand description of a warning as a ' 
        Longman 
         direction' will mislead if it is understood as requiring that a warning be given only if the facts of the instant case are generally similar to those that were considered in  
        Longman 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    72 Approaching the matter in the manner suggested by Crennan J, the delay here was relatively short, and akin to that in Tully (two and a quarter years) and DPW v R (almost four years). Whilst the explanation for the delay was not as dramatic as in Tully v The Queen, an explanation, nonetheless, was given. The complainant said that the appellant had asked her to remain silent, which she did for four years until she wrote the note to her brother. When interviewed by the police, she said this: (p26) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q217 Did you tell anyone what happened this first time? 
         
        A. No, Afterwards, like before he left, he, he always tells me not to tell anyone that he was there, so I never tell anyone that he was there. Because I like to keep my promises."" 
        
       
      
    73 Was there disadvantage arising from delay which would not have been obvious to the jury? The appellant, in submissions, argued that there had been prejudice in various ways (supra at [54]). However, I am not persuaded there was disadvantage, apart from the inability to carry out medical examinations in a timely way, a matter which his Honour emphasised. The appellant had employment records which, on his case, showed the pattern and intensity of his hours. There was no evidence that he had attempted to obtain the complete employment records on subpoena, only to find that they had been destroyed or were unavailable because of delay. It was the Crown case that the offences (except in respect of counts 5, 5A and 6) were committed when the appellant was alone in the house with the complainant. It was the defence case that the complainant was deliberately fabricating her account. Who was living in the house was relevant to opportunity, but of limited importance, and certainly not determinative. The complainant, her mother and brother, readily acknowledged in cross examination that there were others living in the house at various times. No-one else from the house was called. There was no evidence of an attempt to locate those who had lived in the house, who, through delay, were no longer available. More precise information was unlikely, whenever the prosecution was brought. Further, it was unsurprising that the complainant was unable to identify a particular date in respect of each incident, apart from the last. On the Crown case, the offences were committed by an adult against a child, who had been told not to tell anyone. They were committed in the context of a sexual relationship, where there were other uncharged acts (cf Crennan J in Tully v The Queen (supra at [187]). Such prejudice as there was arising from delay was either obvious or the subject of a specific direction (in the case of the medical examination) by his Honour (SU: 11) (supra at [48]) and (SU: 22) (supra at [51]). 
     
      
    74 It is questionable, in these circumstances, whether a Longman warning was required. Nonetheless, the parties and the trial Judge approached the matter upon an assumption that such a direction was required. I will therefore make the same assumption. 
     
      
    75 I pass to the second issue, the content of the warning. The formulation by the High Court in Longman v The Queen (supra) was analysed by Sully J in R v BWT [2002] NSWCCA 60; (2002) 54 NSWLR 241 (Wood CJ at CL and Dowd J agreeing), where the following was said: (at 273) 
     
      
       
        
        ""… first, that because of the passage of time the evidence of the complainant cannot be adequately tested; secondly, that it would be, therefore, dangerous to convict on that evidence alone; thirdly, that the jury is entitled, nevertheless, to act upon that evidence alone if satisfied of its truth and accuracy; fourthly, that the jury cannot be so satisfied without having first scrutinised the evidence with great care; fifthly, that the carrying out of that scrutiny must take into careful account any circumstances which are peculiar to the particular case and which have a logical bearing upon the truth and accuracy of the complainant's evidence; and sixthly, that every stage of the carrying out of that scrutiny of the complainant's evidence must take serious account of the warning as to the dangers of conviction."" 
        
       
      
    76 In R v WSP [2005] NSWCCA 427, Spigelman CJ pointed out that Longman was not a statute. The warning must be fashioned to reflect the circumstances of the particular case. In JJB v R [2006] NSWCCA 126; (2006) 161 A Crim R 187, it was said that in the years following R v BWT a number of courts in varous states had seen the need for greater flexibility in applying Longman v The Queen, that the formulation of Sully J in R v BWT would appear to allow (at [43]). In DRE v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 280; (2006) 164 A Crim R 400, Simpson J observed that no definitive statements as to the minimum requirements of a Longman direction had yet emerged (at [59]). Barr J in DPW v The Queen (supra) said, nonetheless, that a number of comments could be made with confidence. One was that the length of the delay will affect the content and strength of the warning. His Honour said this: (at 588) 
     
      
       
        
        "" … the charge to the jury should take into account all the relevant circumstances of the case before the jury. One circumstance will be the length of time which elapsed between the events and the accused's appreciation of the accusation. In cases of gross delay, the charge will need to be strong. It is not irrelevant that the strong warnings called for in  
        Longman 
         and  
        Crampton 
         resulted from delays approaching and exceeding twenty years. See also  
        Sheehan v The Queen 
         (2006) 163 A Crim R 397, another case in this Court calling for a strong direction, which was concerned with delays varying between seventeen and twenty-two years."" 
        
       
      
    77 In that case, it was relevant that the trial Judge had given a ""strong Murray direction"" on the need for caution when examining the complainant's evidence, and that counsel then appearing for the accused had not objected, nor sought any further or stronger direction (at [33]). 
     
      
    78 Turning to the third issue, the adequacy in this trial of the Longman warning, his Honour (accepting the invitation of counsel for Mr Perez) characterised a number of matters as ""disadvantages to Mr Perez arising from delay"". For the reasons I have given, I do not believe that some of these matters were, in fact, disadvantageous or, if they were, that it was not obvious. To that extent, the directions given by his Honour were favourable. As in DPW v The Queen, a Murray direction was given, warning the jury that there was a need to scrutinise the complainant's evidence with great care. Whilst it would have been better had the Murray warning been immediately followed by a discussion of delay, and the difficulties it created for Mr Perez, no complaint was made by counsel. No further direction was sought. In my view there was, in these circumstances, no error.79 I would dismiss ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The  
      Markuleski 
       direction. 
       
      
    80 In R v Markuleski ([2001] NSWCCA 290; (2001) 52 NSWLR 82), Spigelman CJ said this: (at 121) 
     
      
       
        
        ""186 In the light of the number of cases it is desirable that the traditional direction as to treating each count separately is supplemented in a word against word case. Some reference ought to be made to the effect upon the assessment of the credibility of a complainant if the jury finds itself unable to accept the complainant's evidence with respect to any count."" 
        
       
      
    81 The Chief Justice added: (at 122) 
     
      
       
        
        ""191 The precise terminology must remain a matter for the trial judge in all the particular circumstances of the specific case. The crucial matter is to indicate to the jury that any doubt they may form with respect to one aspect of the complainant's evidence, ought to be considered by them when assessing the overall credibility of the complainant and, therefore, when deciding whether or not there was a reasonable doubt about the complainant's evidence with respect to other counts."" 
        
       
      
    82 Wood CJ at CL added the following comment: (at 134/135) 
     
      
       
        
        ""257 On the other hand, there is merit, as a matter of common sense, in reminding the jury that the existence of a question mark in their minds concerning the credibility, or reliability of the evidence given by a complainant or central witness in relation to one count, may properly be taken into account, in conjunction with all the other circumstances of the case, when they consider the reliability or credibility of the evidence of that complainant or witness in relation to the other counts."" 
        
       
      
    83 Grove J, said this in respect of the proposed directions: (at 138) 
     
      
       
        
        ""280 … Whilst I consider that it would be prudent to give such a direction in some cases I am apprehensive that language incorporating the concept of cruciality will be interpreted as mandatory. For my part I would refrain from expression in any terms which might be so interpreted. There may be cases in which it could be necessary to assist a jury by way of an instruction such as is under discussion but in some way it may not. In my view it would suffice to commend the matter for consideration of trial judges."" 
        
       
      
    84 Simpson J dissented and Carruthers AJ agreed with the Chief Justice.  
     
      
    85 Here, the appellant's complaint arose out of the following passage in the summing up: (SU: 20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""I think I have said something already about the delay in complaining about the earlier matters, I have given you some directions about that. I should add to that in this form, regarding those, I will call them the four events, that give rise to those early counts in the indictment, you are entitled to take those matters, that is the delay in complaining, you are entitled to take that into account when you are assessing the complainant's credibility, that is in relation to the earlier charges, that is up to and including count 4A. 
        
       
       
        
        You are also entitled to take into account, if you get to the stage, for example if you find that you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the crown has proved its case in respect of one count, leading to a verdict of not guilty, you are entitled to take that finding into account when you are assessing the complainant's reliability generally on the other counts."" 
        
       
      
    86 These directions were given immediately after the adjournment, which was taken part way through the summing up. During the adjournment, counsel for Mr Perez handed his Honour a document (MFI 6) setting out the directions he sought. The first paragraph of the summing up, set out above, reflected the direction based upon R v Johnston (1998) 45 NSWLR 362 which counsel had sought on the appellant's behalf. The second paragraph was the Markuleski direction. 
     
      
    87 His Honour did not, as such, tell the jury that they must consider each count separately, although it was implicit in the instructions he gave on onus, and his commentary upon each count. This was clearly an oversight, since the standard direction had been discussed with counsel, and his Honour had said that he intended to give it. Neither counsel referred to the matter at the end of the summing up. However, in his preliminary instructions to the jury, at the beginning of the trial, his Honour said this, having referred to the indictment: (24.10.06: T11) 
     
      
       
        
        ""There'll be discussion as to the various components of these charges during the trial, but you'll have to consider each one separately. They're all individual charges. Don't draw any inference against the accused because of the number of charges. Each one needs to be looked at separately and at the end of the day, you'll be invited to consider whether the Crown has made out its case beyond reasonable doubt in relation to each charge."" 
        
       
      
    88 Counsel for the Crown, in opening, said much the same thing: (T14) 
     
      
       
        
        ""You all have a copy of the indictment which is just the charges that the accused faces. When you look at it, there are six counts on the indictment. Of those, three of the counts have alternative counts. That's - the alternative counts being 3A, 4A and 5A. As his Honour said to you, you have to consider each count individually. They're being run together as a matter of convenience. You can't use the evidence in one in deciding about the evidence in the other. You have to look at them separately … "" 
        
       
      
    89 The final addresses of counsel were framed with this requirement in mind, dealing separately with the evidence in relation to each count. 
     
      
    90 Two complaints were made by the appellant, concerning the Markuleski direction. First, attention was drawn to the limitation in the first paragraph (the Johnston direction). It related to ""the four events, that give rise to those early counts in the indictment"". Coupling that direction with the paragraph that followed, the Markuleski direction, meant that it would not have been apparent to the jury that the Markuleski direction related to the whole indictment, including counts 5, 5A and 6. The appellant, of course, was acquitted in respect of counts 5, 5A and 6, and that finding was available to the jury when considering the remaining counts. It was important that the jury appreciate that they could take those acquittals into account when considering the earlier counts. 
     
      
    91 I am quite unpersuaded by this argument. As the Crown pointed out, the subject matter in the two paragraphs of the summing up was quite different. The early paragraph was talking about delay by the complainant in making her complaint. There had been no delay in respect of the last incident, so that the instruction to the jury was appropriately limited to the first four episodes. The Markuleski direction, on the other hand, was not dealing with delay. It was dealing with whether the Crown had proved its case in respect of each particular count. The direction was of general application. His Honour expressly said so. A reasonable doubt on one count, leading to a verdict of not guilty, could be taken into account when ""assessing the complainant's reliability generally on the other counts"". No complaint was made by counsel for Mr Perez. No request was made for a redirection. 
     
      
    92 Moving to the second complaint, attention was drawn by the appellant to the insertion in the Markuleski direction of the words ""for example"". Counsel said, correctly, that these words were not part of the direction and should not have been used. It was acknowledged that the instruction given to the jury was otherwise appropriate. However, the inclusion of these words, according to the appellant, meant his Honour had opened up an impermissible line of reasoning. The jury could have reasoned that it was appropriate to use a guilty verdict in respect of one count when considering other counts. 
     
      
    93 However, again I am not persuaded that the intrusion of the words ""for example"" carried that danger. Again, no complaint was made by counsel that his Honour's words carried that implication or that danger. That is a reasonably reliable indicator that there was no reasonable cause for concern (R v Saffron (1989) 17 NSWLR 395 (at 434); R v Ita [2003] NSWCCA 174;  (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [90]; Tekely and Nagle v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89]). Had the jury resorted to that mode of reasoning, you would have expected a conviction on counts 5 or 5A and 6, whereas the appellant was acquitted of those charges.  
     
      
    94 Again, I would refuse leave to argue this ground under Rule 4. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Inconsistent verdicts. 
       
      
    95 The notice of appeal expressed ground 4 in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The jury, acting reasonably in all the circumstances should have entertained a sufficient doubt as to the guilt of the appellant upon Count 1, 2, 3a and 4a especially having regard to the acquittals by the jury on counts 3, 4, 5, 5a and 6."" 
        
       
      
    96 The appellant suggests that, in accordance with s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the ""verdict of the jury should be set aside on the grounds that it was unreasonable"". The issue for this Court was expressed by Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487, as follows: (at 493) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty."" 
        
       
       (footnotes omitted) 
       
      
    97 The appellant acknowledged that the test was one of ""logic and reasonableness"" (MacKenzie v The Queen (1996) 190 CLR 348, per Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ at 366). In that case, the following was said: (at 367) 
     
      
       
        
        ""… Thus, if there is a proper way by which the appellate court may reconcile the verdicts, allowing it to conclude that the jury performed their functions as required, that conclusion will generally be accepted ( 
        R v Wilkinson  
        [1970] Crim LR 176). If there is some evidence to support the verdict said to be inconsistent, it is not the role of the appellate court, upon this ground, to substitute its opinion of the facts for one which was open to the jury ( 
        Hayes v The Queen 
         (1973) 47 ALJR 603 at 604-605)."" 
        
       
      
    98 Did the not guilty verdicts damage the credibility of the complainant, such that the only reasonable conclusion is that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truth of her evidence in those counts where a verdict of not guilty was returned? (Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439, per Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ at 453). 
     
      
    99 Here the jury was not satisfied on the issue of consent in counts 3 and 4, returning a guilty verdict in respect of counts 3A and 4A, where consent was not an issue. On that aspect, counsel for the appellant, in written submissions, made the following concession: (Appellant's submissions: p20) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is conceded that the acquittal by the jury of counts 3 and 4 and the conviction to counts (3a) and (4a) may simply reflect that the jury were not satisfied to the requisite standard that (the) Appellant knew the complainant was not consenting to the sexual intercourse or was reckless in relation to his state of mind."" 
        
       
      
    100 Although there was some retreat from that concession in argument, I believe the concession was properly made. The real issue concerned the not guilty verdicts returned on counts 5, 5A and count 6. On those counts, as the appellant submitted, the evidence was more precise and detailed, the incident having occurred immediately before the matter was drawn to the attention of the police. The complainant's account was supported by a recent complaint to her brother and the history she had provided to Dr Norrie. In these circumstances, the appellant, in written submission, said this: (p24) 
     
      
       
        
        ""It is submitted that there is no rational explanation available on the evidence which could explain the Jury convicting on counts 1, 2, 3a and 4a while acquitting on counts 5, 5a and 6. The position of the Jury being not satisfied in regard to the later date specific counts, it is submitted, would mean that they should have also held a reasonable doubt regarding counts 1, 2, 3a and 4a."" 
        
       
      
    101 The Crown answered these submissions by drawing attention to the terms of the indictment, which was date specific in respect of counts 5, 5A and 6 (13 June 2004). His Honour had expressly directed the jury (at SU: 1), ""… as you look at each count you would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the events occurred within the time frame indicated in each count"". Here, according to the Crown, the evidence revealed great uncertainty as to the date of the last incident. 
     
      
    102 It will be remembered that the complainant's note to her brother was undated. The brother gave evidence that he got the note ""a couple of days before his grandmother's death"" (25.10.06: T59). He then corrected that evidence saying that he meant a couple of days after his grandmother's death (T60). His grandmother died on Monday 14 June 2004 at about 1.00 pm. The brother said he came home at about midnight and saw the envelope containing the note. He contacted the police the next morning. The following was put to him: (T76) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Yes. Could you be wrong about that date? 
         
        A. Not really, no, again it has all been documented and the police turned up that day and that's what happened."" 
        
       
      
    103 The police came on Wednesday 16 June 2004, which would suggest that the brother got the note at midnight on Tuesday 15 June 2004, the day after his grandmother died. 
     
      
    104 The account given by the complainant's mother in her evidence in chief suggested that she had been summoned to the hospital by her cousin on Sunday 13 June 2004, having been told that her mother was dying (25.10.06: T88). She immediately called Mr Perez and asked him to keep an eye on the complainant (T89). Her mother, as mentioned, died the next day, Monday 14 June 2004 (T88).  
     
      
    105 However, when cross examined, the position became much less certain. She acknowledged that her mother had been admitted to hospital on Thursday 10 June 2004. She accepted that she would have visited her each day. It was put to her in cross examination that Mr Perez had been at the family home on Saturday 12 June 2004 and again after her mother's death. The cross examination included the following: (26.10.06: T15) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. … you are just simply mistaken about the 12th and the 13th because it was a distressing time? That's what I'm suggesting to you? 
         
        A. Well I can't say, I can't say that I was mistaken in anything because it was a very, very - a very stressful situation yes it was because I was coping with my mother's death and also what was happening on the assault of my daughter … and it was taking its toll. How can I remember exactly every day time and everything?"" 
         
        (parenthesis added) 
        
       
      
    106 The complainant's evidence was no more certain as to the date, although she did give a history to the police and Dr Norrie on 16 June, suggesting that the fifth incident had occurred on Sunday 13 June 2004. In cross examination, the complainant said this: (25.10.06: T39) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. … in fact this allegation occurs on 13 June according to you, is that right, 2004? 
         
        A. I can't remember the date. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You tell the police when you were being interviewed, which is 23 June 2004 that it occurred a couple of weeks prior to being interviewed? 
         
        A. Yeah."" 
        
       
      
    107 The cross examination continued: (T48) 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Well is there any significant event, was there an anniversary, a birthday, anything unusual, a cartoon programme that allows you to remember this event on that particular weekend? 
         
        A. The death of my grandma. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When did that occur in relation to this event? 
         
        A. I don't know. I can't remember the exact --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was it days before, the day that it happened, days after? 
         
        A. I don't know."" 
        
       
      
    108 The appellant, as mentioned, did not give evidence. However, his answer to the police in the ERISP suggested that he had been called by the complainant's mother on the day the grandmother died, Monday 14 June 2004. It is convenient to set out again part of his answer: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A96 When the mother, grandmother die, you know, yeah, (the mother), she, she call me from the hospital, you know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q97. Yeah. 
         
        A. Grandmother die at 1.30, she call me maybe 2 o'clock and she, she told me, you know, 'Go to, to my house, you know, because Mario is a carpenter working, doing some renovation. And I said (the complainant) there and my son, …, you know.'"" 
        
       
      
    109 The only witness called in the appellant's case, Jorge Saliadarra, gave evidence that he had known the appellant for five or six years within the Spanish community. He said they were not friends. He had been to the appellant's house on two or three occasions. He recalled the long weekend in June 2004. On Sunday 13 June 2004, he and a friend drove to the appellant's home, arriving at about 2.00 pm. They picked oranges for about 45 minutes. The appellant was at home. That evidence did not, as such, furnish an alibi, since the complainant had suggested that the last assault occurred after 5.00 pm. Nonetheless, it was evidence inconsistent with the account given by the complainant's mother, who had said that she had summoned the appellant shortly after 1.00 pm on Sunday 13 June 2004, the day before her mother had died. 
     
      
    110 Counsel for Mr Perez, when addressing the jury, dealt at some length with the uncertainty surrounding the date of the alleged assault. He submitted that the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant had been assaulted on Sunday 13 June 2004, as suggested by counts 5, 5A and 6. 
     
      
    111 Having concluded his address and before the judge began summing up, the jury sent a note. The note was in these terms: (SU: 1) 
     
      
       
        
        ""(As) a matter of law if we believed an act occurred but the allegations give the wrong date can we find the accused guilty?"" 
        
       
      
    112 The Crown, on this appeal, attached great importance to that note. It provided, in the Crown's submission, a logical and plausible explanation for the rejection by the jury of counts 5, 5A and 6, which did not reflect adversely upon the complainant's credit. 
     
      
    113 I accept the Crown's submission. I believe the jury verdicts were not inconsistent. The guilty verdicts in counts 1, 2, 3A and 4A were not unreasonable. 
     
      
    114 I would dismiss ground 4. Accordingly, the appeal against conviction fails. I therefore turn to the application for leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Appeal against sentence. 
       
      
    115 It will be remembered that the appellant relied upon two grounds in the appeal against sentence: 
     
      
       
        
      Ground 5 
      : The trial Judge wrongly assumed that there was a standard non parole period in respect of the offences in counts 1 and 2. 
       
       
        
      Ground 6 
      : The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    116 Mr Perez was convicted on two counts of aggravated indecent assault, s 61M(1) Crimes Act. Count 1 related to the period 28.3.00 to 31.12.00, when the complainant was 10 years old. Count 2 was referable to the period 28.3.01 to 28.3.02, when the complainant was 11 years. 
     
      
    117 The maximum penalty was 7 years imprisonment. His Honour was informed by the Crown that there was a standard non parole period of 5 years. In fact, the amendments to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, introducing Div 1A of Pt 4 and standard non parole periods for certain offences, did not begin operation until 1 February 2003. It had no application to counts 1 and 2. 
     
      
    118 The error plainly affected the sentences imposed. His Honour said this: (ROS: 4) 
     
      
       
        
        ""The most difficult part of the whole exercise, to my mind, is the fact that a standard non-parole period of five years applies in respect of what I will call the indecent assault charges, whereas there is no standard non-parole period in respect of the charges which deal with actual penile vaginal intercourse."" 
        
       
      
    119 His Honour added: (ROS: 8) 
     
      
       
        
        ""… Now, I have endeavoured to look carefully at that - all the material in the case and certainly if it were within my power, I would have imposed a less non-parole period than five years. In fact, probably more of the order of two and a half to three years, but it seems - as I have indicated, it seems to me that I am simply compelled to impose a five year non-parole period in relation to counts 1 and 2."" 
        
       
      
    120 His Honour then imposed the maximum penalty in respect of counts 1 and 2, that is 7 years imprisonment with a non parole of 5 years, both sentences concurrent. 
     
      
    121 The Crown on this appeal conceded error. However, it drew attention to the sentences imposed in respect of counts 3A and 4A (sexual intercourse with a child contrary to s 66C(1)), where the maximum penalty was 8 years imprisonment. On each count his Honour imposed a sentence of 6 years, with a non parole period of 5 years, both sentences to be concurrent. He fixed a starting date for the sentences on counts 1 and 2 of 25 June 2006 and a commencement date in respect of counts 3A and 4A of 25 December 2006. The accumulation was only 6 months. The overall sentence was 7 years, with a non parole period of 5 -1/2 years. The Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted (s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912). 
     
      
    122 It is clear, in my view, that the sentencing discretion miscarried. There is a need to resentence, if only to restructure the sentences imposed. The issue is whether, in resentencing, a lesser sentence is warranted. 
     
      
    123 I turn, then, to ground 6 and the submission that the sentences were manifestly excessive. The offences have been described. Count 1 was committed against the complainant when she was 10 years old. Section 61M(1) of the Crimes Act concerns an offence against children aged between 10 and 16 years. As a generality, the younger the child, the more serious the offence (FV v R [2006] NSWCCA 237 at [59]). At the time the offence was committed, Mr Perez was 45 years old. There was an enormous difference in age and maturity between the appellant and the complainant. He removed her pants. He then rubbed his penis against her vagina. He also put his hands under her top and felt her breasts. Count 2 was a distinct offence, later in time. The complainant was 11 years old. Again, the appellant removed her pants. He simulated intercourse with his erect penis against her vagina. The Crown argued that, being distinct offences, there should be some accumulation. 
     
      
    124 The offence in count 3A was also committed when the complainant was 11 years old. It involved penile penetration and was plainly serious. There was some planning. The appellant had a condom. He caused the complainant pain, although he desisted immediately she complained. Count 4A occurred at a time when the complainant was 12 years old. It will be remembered that the appellant guided the complainant to the couch so that he could keep watch through a window because the complainant's mother was expected home. The offence involved penile penetration. The maximum penalty in respect of each count is 8 years imprisonment (s 66C(1) Crimes Act 1900).  
     
      
    125 Turning to the subjective case, the appellant did not give evidence on sentence. He was a married man, although he had since separated from his wife. He came to Australia from Uruguay as a refugee in 1984. He had convictions for stealing (1987) and larceny (1999), as well as mid range PCA. The Crown conceded that these convictions had little relevance. There was no evidence of remorse (ROS: 6). His Honour did not feel that he had material before him which would allow a finding that it was unlikely Mr Perez would re-offend or that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. This is Mr Perez' first custodial sentence. 
     
      
    126 The offence of aggravated indecent assault of a child (counts 1 and 2) covers a broad range of sexual misconduct. It comprehends inappropriate touching of a child who still has his or her clothes on, to much more serious misbehaviour. Here the misconduct in each count was at least mid range in terms of seriousness. Counts 3A and 4A, where there was penile penetration of a child aged 11 and then 12 years, were plainly very serious. 
     
      
    127 Whilst the appeal should be allowed, and the sentence restructured, I do not believe that a lesser term of imprisonment than 7 years (being the effective total term) is warranted. His Honour fixed a non parole period of 5-1/2 years, which was a small departure (3 months) from the usual statutory ratio (s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). No reasons were given or required. However, but for the misinformation provided to the sentencing Judge, and the distortion it caused to the sentencing discretion, it is reasonable to suppose that the usual ratio would have been fixed. I think that, in fairness to the appellant, in re-sentencing an adjustment (which in other circumstances would amount to ""tinkering""), should be made and the statutory ratio should be restored. 
     
      
       
      Order. 
       
      
    128 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      3. Appeal allowed and sentence imposed on 5 December 2006 quashed and, in lieu thereof, the appellant is sentenced as follows: 
       
       
        
      On counts 1 and 2 
      : Imprisonment for 4 years commencing on 26.6.06 and expiring on 25.6.10, with a non parole period of 3 years commencing on 26.6.06 and expiring on 25.6.09; both sentences to be served concurrently. 
       
       
        
      On count 3A 
      : Imprisonment for 6 years commencing on 26.6.07 and expiring on 25.6.13, with a non parole period of 4 years and 3 months commencing on 26.6.07 and expiring on 25.9.11. 
       
       
        
      On count 4A 
      : A term of imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of 4 years and 3 months, commencing on 26.6.07 and expiring on 25.9.11, with a balance of term of 1 year 9 months commencing on 26.9.11 and expiring on 25.6.13; such term to be concurrent with the term in respect of count 3A. 
       
       
       The first day on which he shall be eligible for parole will be 26 September 2011.

      IN THE MATTER OF AN APPLICATION BY MARTIN LUDWIG KLUSKA PURSUANT TO SCHEDULE 4 OF THE CRIMES (SENTENCING PROCEDURE) ACT 1999 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Martin Ludwig Kluska (the applicant) was indicted upon a charge that on or about 20 July 1988 he murdered Bruce John Mannion. On 22 May 1990, following a lengthy trial, he was found guilty of that crime by the jury. On 10 August 1990, in the absence of finding any significant diminution in culpability for the murder, I imposed a sentence of penal servitude for life dating from his arrest on 28 July 1988. It was imposed in accordance with the applicable statutory sentencing regime.  
     
      
    2 I do not repeat the remarks which I made on that occasion. After the service of eight years in custody, the applicant sought redetermination of that life sentence and the setting of a determinate sentence pursuant to s 13A of the Sentencing Act 1989. That application was heard on 27 November 1998 and on 18 December 1998, for reasons then published, I declined the application and directed that no further application be lodged until three years had expired thereafter.  
     
      
    3 Since then, the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 has been passed and existing life sentences such as that being served by the applicant became subject to the provisions set out in Schedule 4 to that Act. The application now before the Court is therefore governed thereby. 
     
      
    4 Some relevant clauses in the Schedule should be recited: 
     
      
       
        
        “3 (1) In considering an application in relation to an existing life sentence, the Supreme Court is to have regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) all of the circumstances surrounding the offence for which the sentence was imposed, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) all offences, wherever and whenever committed, of which the offender has been convicted, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        so far as this information is reasonably available to the Supreme Court. 
        
       
       
        
        ... 
        
       
       
        
         
        4 (1) The Supreme Court may dispose of an application in relation to an existing life sentence: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) by setting a specified term for the sentence together with a non-parole period for the sentence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) by declining to set a specified term for the sentence but setting a non-parole period for the sentence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) by declining to set a specified term for the sentence and declining to set a non-parole period for the sentence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        7 (1) In considering an application referred to in clause 2 (1), the Supreme Court is to have regard to: 
        
       
       
       
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any reports on the offender made by the Review Council, and any other relevant reports prepared after the offender was sentenced, that are available to the Supreme Court, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the need to preserve the safety of the community, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the age of the offender (at the time the offender committed the offence and also at the time the Supreme Court deals with the application), and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) in the case of an offender sentenced before 12 January 1990 (the date on which section 463 of the Crimes Act 1900 was repealed by section 5 of the Prisons (Serious Offenders Review Board) Amendment Act 1989), the fact that the sentencing court: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) would have been aware that an offender sentenced to imprisonment for life was eligible to be released on licence under section 463 of the Crimes Act 1900, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) would have been aware of the practice relating to the issue of such licences, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) any other relevant matter.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 In accordance with the procedures which have been adopted for dealing with these applications, a statement of facts has been prepared. Paragraphs 12 to 34 provide an overview and a formal notice signed by the solicitor for the applicant accepts that these (as well as other matters) provide an accurate summary of the prosecution case. 
     
      
    6 I extract therefrom: 
     
      
       
        
        “12 The 37 years old victim Bruce John MANNION graduated from the University of New South Wales with a Bachelor of Science (Wool and Pastoral Science) degree and joined the Department of Agriculture. At the time of his murder he was an advisory officer with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries at Dubbo. 
        
       
       
        
        13 He was involved in other pursuits in the Dubbo community including: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Platoon Commander of the Dubbo Army Reserve Unit; 
           
          (2) Secretary of the Dubbo Railway Historical Society; and 
           
          (3) A member of the Anglican Community of the Good Shepherd. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        14 The applicant was released to parole from Long Bay Prison Complex (sic - Parramatta) on 14 July 1987 after serving sentences for kidnapping, armed robbery, escape from lawful custody, being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. The parole was extant until September 1989. 
        
       
       
        
        15 Through arrangements made by the Anglican Chaplain at Long Bay the applicant went to reside at the farm of Mrs Lola FOGARTY, a member of the Anglican Community of the Good Shepherd. 
        
       
       
        
        16 During the ensuing ten months he changed his place of residence on a number of occasions mainly through contacts in the Anglican Community, including two periods when he lived with the Weingarth family at St Faith’s House of Prayer in Dubbo. 
        
       
       
        
        17 The applicant came into contact with Bruce MANNION through their involvement with the Community and from late May 1988 until the murder he resided at the house of Mr Mannion at 34 Dalton Street, Dubbo. 
        
       
       
        
        18 One female member of the community recalled that about March/April 1988 the applicant informed her that he was really sick of being poor and wished he could get his hands on a lot of money. If he did so he would really like a car as he was sick of riding his push bike. 
        
       
       
        
        19 On or about 28 June 1988 a break and enter occurred at St Faith’s House of Prayer during which a number of items, including a Browning trombone action .22 rifle were stolen. The items were the property of Mr and Mrs Weingarth. 
        
       
       
        
        20 At this point it can be mentioned that Bruce MANNION owned a yellow Holden Camira sedan and also a Kawasaki 750CC motor cycle. He also had the use of a Nissan Pintara sedan in the course of his field work with the Agriculture Department. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Events of Wednesday, 20 July 1988 et seq 
        
       
       
        
        21 Bruce MANNION was last seen alive, by persons who knew him, in the applicant’s company at the Dubbo RSL at about 9.30pm on 20 July 1988. The applicant was heard to ask the victim whether he was ready to go home but the reply to the query was not heard. 
        
       
       
        
        22 Mr MANNION failed to attend for work on either 21 or 22 July 1988, did not arrive at his parents Sydney home by arrangement on the evening of Friday 22 July 1988 and when he had not appeared the next day on which he was to participate in a Regimental dinner that evening his father reported him missing to police. 
        
       
       
        
        23 The applicant was seen by a number of persons in Dubbo and adjoining areas on 21 July 1988 from about 7am when he was observed to be in the victim’s yellow Camira. Other sightings had him riding the victim’s Kawasaki motor cycle. 
        
       
       
        
        24 Shortly after midday on 21 July the applicant returned the Nissan Pintara, which Mr Mannion had been using, to the parking area at the Department of Agriculture and handed in the keys to the vehicle to a receptionist. On Monday 25 July an inspection of the front seat of the vehicle located what purported to be a letter of resignation signed by Bruce Mannion which was subsequently found to be a forgery – see paragraph 38 of this Statement. 
        
       
       
        
        25 Late in the evening of 21 July 1988 the applicant drove the victim’s Camira to Sydney where at about 2am on Friday 22 July he met up with two young females, MB and TJ at Chinatown. 
        
       
       
        
        26 At about 3am on 22 July the applicant, using the name Bruce Mannion booked into the Boulevarde Hotel Kings Cross with his female companions. 
        
       
       
        
        27 During the course of that day he withdrew $2000 from Mannion’s Westpac Bank account and used the money to purchase items of jewellery over the weekend. He also arranged by telephone for a removalist to go to Dubbo on Tuesday, 26 July and remove the furniture from 34 Dalton Street and take it to Surfers Paradise where it was to be placed in storage for a couple of weeks. The keys to the house were to be left at the Boulevarde Hotel for collection by the removalist. 
        
       
       
        
        28 On Monday, 25 July he withdrew another $1000 from the Westpac account of his victim before driving to Dubbo with MB late in the afternoon. As he did not have the keys with him he secured the services of a locksmith to gain entry to the Dalton Street premises from which he removed, inter alia, a stereo recorder. The couple then drove back to Sydney arriving at about midnight at the Boulevarde Hotel. 
        
       
       
        
        29 On 26 July the applicant again using the name of Bruce Mannion, arranged for a counter cheque for $10,000 to be made out at a Sydney Branch of the Westpac Bank which cheque was then cashed. 
        
       
       
        
        30 On Wednesday 27 July he scrubbed out the boot of the Camira before driving with MB and LJ to Parramatta where he left the girls in the vehicle while he took a motor cycle from Action Motor Cycles for a test ride to Concord. 
        
       
       
        
        31 When he reached Concord he went to Garrick O’Neill Motors in Parramatta Road where he had been the previous day to pay a deposit of $2000 on a Ford Fairlane. 
        
       
       
        
        32 While he was at the Motor dealers he was at about 11.15am approached by detectives to whom he gave the name of Bruce Mannion and produced identification from his victim’s wallet which also contained the sum of $5200. 
        
       
       
        
        33 He was told that he was to be taken to Burwood Police Station to be questioned about the disappearance of Mannion. On arrival at the Station he requested the Detectives to inform the two girls at Parramatta of his whereabouts. 
        
       
       
        
        34 Shortly after 1pm the arresting police handed over to Detectives McNevin and Allen the conduct of questioning of the applicant who admitted he was not Bruce Mannion but Kluska.” 
        
       
       
      Included in the above was a reference to paragraph numbered 38 of the statement of facts which reads: 
       
       
        
        “38 It might be noted that the applicant made no admission of responsibility for the disappearance and murder of Bruce Mannion but he did admit assuming his identity and withdrawing funds from his accounts, using his Holden Camira motor vehicle, arranging for furniture to be removed from Mannion’s Dalton Street house for storage and for signing the purported letter of resignation from the Department of Agriculture.” 
        
       
      
    7 In 1990 in my remarks on sentence I referred to a report by Dr Hugh Jolly, a psychiatrist, who had in 1985 opined that the applicant had a personality disorder of such severity, in the instance a form of psychopathy, as to be close to being a defect of reason. No issue of mental illness had been raised at trial but as I noted in 1998 when dealing with the previous application, the applicant had by 1997 been certified as a mentally ill person and classified as a forensic patient. He was then detained in a prison hospital. 
     
      
    8 There is no present need to detail aspects of history relating to assessed mental status from time to time since then. An up to date report (21 February 2008) from Dr Jeremy O’Dea is in evidence. Dr O’Dea was one of the two psychiatrists who certified the applicant in 1997.  
     
      
    9 Dr O’Dea records that the applicant is currently prescribed oral anti-psychotic medication (Amisulpride solrain 800 mg daily) and other medications for physical ailments. At various times the applicant has asserted that he has no need of antipsychotic medication but whilst in custody he can be compelled to take it. I would have serious concerns about the risk that the applicant would present to the community if he were to cease medication. 
     
      
    10 I have taken into account all of the material but specifically the whole of Dr O’Dea’s report and I recite his final conclusions and recommendations: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Kluska is suffering from a chronic severe paranoid schizophrenic illness characterized by long standing paranoid and somatic delusions, auditory hallucinations, and disorder in the form of his thinking, accompanied by mood and behavioural disturbance. He has limited insight into his illness and has a history of non compliance with psychiatric treatment. 
        
       
       
        
        That being said, it would appear that his schizophrenic illness has responded at least to some extent over the recent past to his current oral antipsychotic medication and management at Junee Correctional Centre. However, his schizophrenic illness has yet to come under adequate control with at least ongoing paranoia and thought disorder. I could not convince myself that he no longer held his paranoid and somatic delusions or that he (was) now (no) longer concerned about these beliefs. 
        
       
       
        
        I could not draw a direct causal link between Mr Kluska’s schizophrenic illness and the index offence or his forensic history. I note reference in the documentation made available to me to Mr Kluska’s personality. It is likely that he would satisfy the psychiatric diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of a personality disorder. However, I would consider that his primary psychiatric diagnosis is of a schizophrenic illness and that his primary psychiatric management focus, at least in the short to medium term, should be on treatment of his schizophrenic illness, with additional focus on Mr Kluska’s personality and history of substance abuse. It would seem appropriate that Mr Kluska remain abstinent from alcohol and other drug use in the long term in order to manage and minimise the risk of relapse of his schizophrenic illness and further offending behaviour. 
        
       
       
        
        Regardless of the outcome of the re-determination of his sentence, Mr Kluska will require ongoing structured and supervised psychiatric care and treatment under the provisions of the New South Wales Mental Health Act in the long term in order to maximize his response to treatment and minimise the risk of relapse of his schizophrenic illness and minimise the risk of him engaging in further violent offending behaviour. This should involve reconsideration of antipsychotic medication via depot injection in addition to oral antipsychotic medication, with the aim of maximizing response to treatment and compliance.” 
        
       
      
    11 Even as recently as to Dr O’Dea in February this year, the applicant spoke of the time “once he has been acquitted of the murder”. As I have said previously, the proof of guilt was overwhelming but I cannot determine whether these protestations are aspects of the applicant’s mental condition or are false postures which he is deliberately presenting. Over the years the applicant has from time to time confessed his guilt and then recanted his confession. Bruce Mannion’s body has never been located. On one occasion when a confession by the applicant was “current” he took police to bushland in the Gnoo State Forest and indicated an area which was extensively cleared and excavated but no trace of Mr Mannion’s body was found.  
     
      
    12 Inter alia, the applicant has written to the then Commissioner of Police seeking to provoke missing persons action in relation to the deceased. He has also at times asserted that Bruce Mannion has in fact been found and buried in a cemetery plot in Sydney. To my observation Mr Mannion’s mother has attended the trial in 1990, the hearing in 1998 and the hearing of this application. I am informed that she is now eighty years of age. In the years that have passed since their son’s murder, Mr Mannion’s father has died but he has three surviving brothers. It is plain that the hope of Bruce Mannion’s family that his body might be found is dependent upon relevant information being forthcoming from the applicant. It is impossible for me to know the extent to which the applicant’s mental illness contributes to his unwillingness to locate it.  
     
      
    13 The applicant’s behaviour whilst in custody has not been good and there is a schedule in evidence setting out numerous disciplinary charges, but I note that misbehaviour seems to have ceased several years ago and the applicant is said to be calmer. He has engaged himself in some intensive bible study. I am satisfied that the compulsion to take medication has significantly contributed to stabilizing his situation. 
     
      
    14 The evidence also includes a series of reports from the Serious Offenders Review Council, the latest of which is dated 17 July 2007. It contains no express recommendation concerning this application but notes that classification will be reviewed in the light of whatever decision is made.  
     
      
    15 In relation to clause 7 (1)(d) of the Schedule above recited, it was agreed by counsel that I should have regard to the statistical survey which has been presented customarily in applications such as this, which show an average of approximately 11.7 years of actual custody before an offender included in the survey was released on licence. I take this into account. Great care, however, needs to be taken in using this statistic. In dealing with similar applications I have observed, and I repeat, that the survey is limited and, in addition, gives no account to the circumstance that there were offenders who were not released on licence at all. 
     
      
    16 There is also a statutory obligation in relation to this application to have regard to all prior offences (clause 3 (1)(b)). The applicant has a lengthy record, which it is not necessary to recount beyond that observation, and the observation that he was on parole when he committed the murder. In addition I must have regard to the age of the applicant, who was born on 26 June 1961 and was therefore aged twenty seven at the time of the offence and is now aged forty six. 
     
      
    17 As the records reveal, I passed remarks when originally sentencing the applicant and also when rejecting a similar application like the present in 1998. On both occasions, it being my duty in what are, in effect, extended sentencing proceedings, I delivered my remarks orally to the applicant as I shall again do on this occasion, in order to ensure, as far as I can, as a matter of practicality, that the applicant is informed of the reasons why courses are or are not taken and resentence declined or imposed. Nothing is to be gained by repetition of these previous remarks which should be regarded as incorporated herein.  
     
      
    18 As clause 4 (1) demonstrates, there are three available options.  
     
      
    19 Option 4 (1)(c) if applied, and accompanied by a prohibition on further application as authorized by clause 6 (1)(a), would have the effect of transforming the life sentence imposed in 1990 to which was impliedly attached a prospect of possible release on licence at some time, into a life sentence without that possibility. 
     
      
    20 Grave though the circumstances of the applicant’s crime are, I am unable to sustain the Crown submission that it falls into the category of a worst case. Some guidance as to what may constitute a worst case may be gained by observation of other cases where, either by imposition since 1989 or by the mechanics whereby application to redetermine existing life sentence is barred, an indeterminate sentence is to be served. It is sufficient to note that the applicant’s crime is not accompanied by the sorts of circumstances which led to those impositions.  
     
      
    21 I therefore conclude that some action in relation to the application should take place.  
     
      
    22 Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that I should implement clause 4 (1)(a) and set a determinate sentence and a non-parole period. He drew attention to the principle that sentences of mere preventive detention are impermissible at common law. Even at common law there is a distinction between extending a sentence merely to protect society and properly looking to society’s protection in the determination of sentence. That experience and discernment is required to draw the fine distinction between those concepts has been recognized by high authority. 
     
      
    23 It is to be remembered that the applicant is, upon the finding of the absence of diminished culpability, which finding is not challenged, the subject of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment pursuant to statute. In the sense that it was mandated by statute it was not an imposition exclusively at common law. The present application is also governed by statute in the terms of Schedule 4. There is therefore a statutory obligation that regard be had to “the need to preserve the safety of the community”.  
     
      
    24 A determinate sentence, as distinct from setting a non-parole period, would see the applicant entitled to enforce his release from custody upon the expiry of term. It is true that there are provisions elsewhere, for example in mental health legislation, which might see him otherwise detained, but whether that happens or not is speculative and there is a present express statutory duty to act in the terms of Schedule 4 in relation to community safety. 
     
      
    25 I would assess the risk posed by the applicant to the community as high. In reaching that conclusion I have taken into account his considerable prior record of serious offending, his record of violent outbursts from time to time whilst in custody, his mental condition which is stable to the extent it is by reason of the ability for him to be compelled to continue medication, and to the risks inherent in his apparently unpredictable changes in recognition of his responsibility for killing.  
     
      
    26 In the whole of the circumstances I decline to set a determinate sentence. 
     
      
    27 However, there is a third alternative and that is, pursuant to clause 4 (1)(b) to set a non-parole period without altering the existing life sentence. That is an approach which is not available where an offender appears for sentence at first instance, as it were, and is exclusively available in these statutory proceedings. This application is to be determined in accordance with the statute and is therefore distinguishable from a conventional imposition of sentence following conviction. The principles to be applied are set out in the Schedule. 
     
      
    28 Taking into account the matters to which I am required to have regard, I conclude that I should decline to set a specified term but should set a non-parole period. The final issue is the length of that non-parole period. It is to be emphasized that expiry of a non-parole period does not mean that the applicant will be released, it simply sets a point of time at which eligibility occurs. Actual release, if it is to occur, will require further decision at the time when it is contemplated and statutory provisions as to parole require, among other things, a determination about the danger which a person, if paroled, might then represent to the community. 
     
      
    29 The applicant has been in custody continuously for over nineteen years. The non-parole period should represent the minimum time during which custody should continue. Some guidance can be extracted from sentencing patterns, including the average time prior to release on licence abovementioned, but the individuality of the applicant’s offence, its circumstances and his antecedents are set out in the accumulated material which I will not further summarize. I assess an appropriate non-parole period at twenty two years.  
     
      
    30 The application is granted to the extent of the following orders and directions: 
     
      
       
      (1) I decline to set a specified term of sentence for the offence of murder upon which the applicant stands convicted. 
       
       
      (2) I set a non-parole period in respect of the existing and continuing sentence of penal servitude for life of twenty two years commencing on 28 July 1988 and expiring on 27 July 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: I agree with Bell JA. 
     
      
    2 BASTEN JA: The primary question which arises in this appeal is whether the respondent, who was towing a heavy vehicle on a freeway, should have provided additional warning to draw attention to the fact that he was travelling at a speed well below that to be expected of such a vehicle in the circumstances. The question relates to an ‘additional warning’ because it was common ground that the sign on the back of the vehicle, which read 
     
      
       
        
        “OVERSIZE 
         
        TOWED VEHICLE” 
        
       
      implicitly gave a warning that the vehicle was travelling slowly. 
       
      
    3 If it could be said that the respondent was negligent in that regard, it is also necessary to assess contributory negligence, which must exceed 50%, the appellant being the driver of a semitrailer, which collided with the rear of the towed vehicle in daylight hours, and in conditions of good visibility. 
     
      
    4 Both the circumstances and the issues have been fully explained by Bell JA and I gratefully adopt her Honour’s exposition. There is no doubt that the driver of the towed vehicle owed a duty of care to other road users, which included a duty to give reasonable warning that the vehicle was travelling slowly. In my view there was a breach of that duty in the circumstances and the breach contributed to the accident in a significant degree. 
     
      
       
      Breach of duty 
      
    5 It is not in dispute that the speed at which the respondent’s vehicle was able to travel required some warning to following vehicles. The warning sign stating that it was a “towed vehicle” undoubtedly provided a driver approaching from behind with information suggesting that the vehicle would be travelling more slowly than might be expected. The warning that the vehicle was “oversize” no doubt indicated that it would take longer to pass the vehicle than might otherwise be anticipated. That was consistent with an expectation that most other road users would need to consider overtaking the towed vehicle because of its slow speed. 
     
      
    6 Although the vehicle was travelling at approximately 35km/h at the time of the collision, the driver’s evidence was that he had achieved that speed slowly, after leaving the Pheasant’s Nest service area and travelling for 4.3 kilometres south. The slow rate of acceleration was due in part to the weight of the vehicle being towed and to the gradual incline of the freeway to the south of the service area. Significantly, over that distance of 4.3 kilometres, the towed vehicle did not exceed 35km/h and, when it entered the freeway was travelling at between 10 and 15km/h. The only available inference is that a large vehicle travelling at such a low speed constituted a hazard on a freeway where the speed was 110km/h for ordinary vehicles and 100km/h for other heavy vehicles including the appellant’s vehicle. 
     
      
    7 It is trite to say that hazardous conditions on a freeway require advance warning to drivers. If the hazard is fixed, the warning may be given by signs when the hazard is quite a distance ahead. When the hazard constitutes a slow moving vehicle, use of hazard lights or a yellow flashing beacon are common. Road maintenance vehicles, road construction vehicles, mowers on grass verges, graders on gravel roads and break down vehicles provide well-known examples. Such lights, whether or not they can be seen at a greater distance than a sign, provide unequivocal notice of a hazard on or near the carriageway. They are often used in conjunction with a sign; they signal a warning to an inadvertent driver. 
     
      
    8 As Bell JA notes at [57]-[59], the appellant gave evidence that he had seen tow trucks displaying flashing lights; Sergeant Kane, who attended the accident, also gave evidence that he had seen vehicles under tow with hazard lights activated. Sergeant Kane stated that the unusually slow speed of the towed vehicle was a contributing factor and, at least by implication, suggested that hazard lights or a flashing yellow light might have been an appropriate warning device. 
     
      
    9 As explained by Bell JA at [64], the Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Regulation 1998 (NSW) (“the Vehicle Registration Regulation”), Schedule 4, expressly envisages that tow trucks and vehicles exceeding regulation length “may be fitted with a light or lights, at least one of which must be mounted on top of the vehicle, capable of displaying a flashing or rotating light”: cl 123(4). Other vehicles dealt with in sub-cl (4) include emergency vehicles, including ambulances and motor breakdown service vehicles, milk delivery vehicles and school buses which stop frequently. Sub-regulation (7) further states: 
     
      
       
        
        “The light from any such light mounted on the top of the vehicle must be visible in normal sunlight from a distance of at least 200 m to a driver approaching that vehicle from any direction.” 
        
       
      
    10 Regulation 55 in the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) (Road Rules) Regulation 1999 (NSW) (“the Road Rules Regulation”) is formulated as a prohibition which requires that such flashing lights or hazard lights be used only where the vehicle is “standing in a hazardous position” or “moving in hazardous circumstances”: reg 55(d)(i) at [62] below. The implication that they should be used in such circumstances no doubt leaves an assessment of need to the discretion of the driver. 
     
      
    11 In relation to hazard lights, the same regulation requires that they not be used unless the vehicle is standing in a hazardous position or “moving in hazardous conditions”. The change in language is unlikely to be significant, but the trial judge took the view that “hazardous conditions” was a phrase which referred to factors such as “road surface (condition), weather, and climatic conditions affecting visibility, or external features that affect the control of vehicles, such as a concealed gaps [sic], or obstacles, or hazards; or factors that restrict manoeuvrability, such as narrow, steep or treacherous carriageway”: Judgment, p 32. Her Honour took the view that “circumstances” referred “more to factors related to traffic such as congestion; speed and volume of passing or involved traffic; and features of the vehicles involved, such as weight or defect”. In any event, her Honour was prepared to consider the question on the basis that the terms were interchangeable, but held that neither phrase embraced “a very large, and obviously slow moving, vehicle”: Judgment, p 33. 
     
      
    12 With respect, I cannot accept that conclusion. Regulation 55, read with the standards set out in Sch 4, cl 123 of the Vehicle Registration Regulation, is concerned with the circumstances in which a hazard light or flashing beacon may be used. It is clear from the other parts of reg 55 that the hazard with respect to which warning should be given arises from the use of the vehicle. Thus, flashing lights may be displayed by an ambulance, police vehicle and other emergency or rescue vehicles when “being used for urgent purposes”, or when a vehicle is being used “to escort” an oversized vehicle or when a vehicle is being used “for law enforcement purposes”. A vehicle which is in a “hazardous position” may use a flashing light because of that position, without regard to circumstances or conditions. Flashing lights may be used on a bus which is moving in hazardous conditions, or while stopped for passengers. School buses which stop frequently may be seen daily with flashing yellow lights. Garbage trucks which stop frequently may carry flashing yellow lights. There is no reason to read the regulation in a restrictive fashion. If a vehicle is creating a hazardous situation, because it is moving slowly (or stopping frequently) it may, and in some cases it would seem must, display a flashing or rotating light visible from 200 metres. Other vehicles, including emergency vehicles and law enforcement vehicles, use flashing lights when travelling at high speed. 
     
      
    13 The purpose of the prohibition in the regulations is to ensure that flashing lights are not used in inappropriate circumstances. However, the prohibition should not be read so as to prevent the appropriate use of flashing lights in situations where a vehicle creates a hazard on the roadway. 
     
      
    14 Further, the Vehicle Registration and Road Rules Regulations provide support for the view that flashing yellow lights are widely recognised as a primary means of warning road users as to hazards. They thus provide support for the proposition that a large vehicle travelling at an unexpectedly slow speed on a freeway should reasonably use flashing hazard lights or a rotating yellow beacon, to warn other road users of the hazardous situation. 
     
      
    15 Once it is accepted, as it should be, that some form of flashing warning light was a reasonable response to the hazard created by the large truck under tow, it is necessary to consider whether such a response was in any sense disproportionate to the circumstances, either by way of inconvenience or cost. However, there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that that was so. Accordingly, I would conclude that the respondent was in breach of his duty to other road users, including the appellant, in driving the vehicle at low speed on a moderately busy freeway, without flashing warning lights. 
     
      
       
      Causation 
      
    16 The trial judge held that even had a flashing yellow light or hazard lights been in operation, “the evidence is clear and simple that they would have made no difference”: Judgment, p 29. The first reason given was that the appellant had stated in evidence that he had not noticed the ‘oversize towed vehicle’ sign and accordingly would not have noticed flashing hazard lights. Secondly, her Honour held that such hazard lights “would not have been visible before the point at which the plaintiff had seen the defendant’s vehicle in any event”. Her Honour’s reasoning concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any such lights, if illuminated or activated, would have been lower, smaller and less obvious than the yellow warning sign actually present; and correspondingly less effective in the circumstances. They could have added nothing. It defies common sense as well as evidence to find that a driver who did not see a towed freightliner and trailer until he was 150 m [away] and completely failed to see a very large warning sign at any point, despite literally driving straight into its rear, would have observed and responded to small and low flickering, hazard lights.” 
        
       
      
    17 One hesitates to defy commonsense and the evidence, but I am not persuaded that a contrary conclusion in the present circumstances does so. The purpose of hazard lights, and a flashing yellow beacon, is to draw attention to that which otherwise might be overlooked. Further, I would place little weight on the appellant’s concession that he would not have noticed hazard lights, when taken out of context. There is no doubt that he did notice the respondent’s vehicle: the question is whether, accepting that he failed to take reasonable care for his own safety, an additional warning might have drawn his attention earlier to its slow speed. If her Honour’s description of hazard lights were accurate, I would conclude that something more was required, namely a yellow flashing or rotating beacon on top of the respondent’s vehicle and visible to traffic approaching from the rear. 
     
      
    18 Given that the very purpose of such a flashing yellow warning light would be to alert drivers to the fact that the vehicle was travelling at an exceptionally slow speed, I would infer that such a light, visible in accordance with clause 123(7) of Schedule 4 to the Vehicle Registration Regulation, from 200 metres, would have alerted the appellant to the risk he was facing at an earlier stage and in sufficient time to allow him to take additional steps to avoid the collision. The fact that the front right corner of his truck clipped the left rear corner of the trailer in front, suggests that he was indeed trying to take evasive action by moving onto the shoulder to avoid the vehicle, when he no longer had time to slow down safely. Because he had suffered a degree of amnesia in relation to the circumstances surrounding the accident, one cannot be sure what his reaction would have been at an earlier stage if he had seen a flashing yellow light. However, I find it more probable than not that he would have taken effective evasive steps in time. There was no suggestion that he was other than a competent and experienced truck driver. 
     
      
       
      Contributory negligence 
      
    19 There can be little doubt that the appellant must bear the greater portion of responsibility for the accident. However, once it is accepted that there was a breach of duty in failing to fit a yellow flashing light to the slow moving vehicle, and that such a light would probably have drawn the appellant’s attention to the hazard caused by the vehicle, the respondent should also bear a significant proportion of the responsibility for the accident. Given the circumstances, I would apportion liability by a finding of 75% contributory negligence. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
      
    20 Having found for the respondent on the question of liability, her Honour stated that this was “not a case in which it is appropriate to assess damages”: Judgment, p 41. No explanation was given for that statement, but at least implicitly it recognises that, as a matter of general practice, it is appropriate for a trial judge to assess damages, having heard the relevant evidence, in case there be error in the finding on liability. 
     
      
    21 No doubt there are significant time pressures which militate against the assessment of damages in a case where it appears to the trial judge to be unnecessary. However, as this Court has said over many years, a trial judge who has heard the medical and other evidence with respect to the injuries suffered and the loss or damage incurred, should make an assessment, against the possibility that the finding on liability may be overturned. Where that does not occur, the parties will be put to the expense of a further hearing to assess damages, with the inevitable duplication in relation to costs which will be incurred. On the basis of the findings proposed above, it would be necessary to remit the matter to the District Court for further hearing. That is unfortunate. All that can be said in mitigation of the circumstance is that each party will be able to protect itself as to further costs by making an appropriate offer (if that has not already been done), taking into account the degree of contributory negligence. It may be hoped that some agreement will be possible as to damages so that a further hearing will be avoided. Nevertheless, this Court must make orders which will provide for a further hearing. 
     
      
    22 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Allow the appeal and set aside orders 1 and 2 made in the District Court on 29 September 2006 giving judgment with costs for the respondent. 
       
       
      (2) In lieu thereof order that there be a judgment for the plaintiff in the District Court on the question of liability together with a finding that the plaintiff was contributorily negligent to the extent of 75%. 
       
       
      (3) Remit the matter to the District Court for an assessment of damages and for orders as to the costs of the first trial and the further hearing. 
       
       
      (4) Order the respondent to pay the appellant’s costs of the appeal. 
       
       
      (5) Grant the respondent a certificate under the  
      Suitors’ Fund Act 
       1951 (NSW). 
       
      
    23 BELL JA: The appellant was injured as the result of a collision between the front of the heavy vehicle, which he was driving (a Freightliner prime mover with an articulated curtain-sided trailer) and the rear of a combination driven by the respondent (a Scania heavy salvage tow-truck with a heavy rigid tip truck and dog trailer in tow). The two vehicles were travelling south on the Hume highway in Lane 1 (the nearside lane). The respondent’s vehicle was travelling at about 35 km/h at the time of the collision.  
     
      
    24 The appellant brought an action against the respondent in the District Court claiming damages for negligence. His case was put on three bases; the rigid tip truck and dog trailer should not have been jointly towed, the respondent’s vehicle should have been driven as far off the main carriageway as possible (there was a wide sealed shoulder adjacent to Lane 1), and hazard lights and/or flashing emergency lights on the respondent’s vehicle should have been activated to alert following traffic to its slow speed.  
     
      
    25 The appellant failed at trial. The Judge found that the respondent was not negligent and that none of the matters particularised as negligent had been the cause of the collision. The appellant contends that the Judge did not approach the determination of negligence in a principled way and he challenges a number of the Judge’s findings of fact.  
     
      
    26 On appeal the appellant confined his case in negligence to the claim that the hazard lights or flashing emergency lights should have been activated on the respondent’s vehicle to alert following traffic that it was travelling very slowly, a fact which may not have been apparent to a driver approaching from a distance.  
     
      
      Factual background 
      
    27 On the morning of 2 March 2001 a Boral rigid tip truck with a dog trailer attached to it broke down at the Mobil Service Station at Pheasant’s Nest, on the Hume Highway south of Sydney. The truck and trailer were both laden with sand. The respondent attended the service centre to tow the disabled combination to Mittagong. Mittagong is approximately 30 kms south of the service centre. The respondent attached his tow-truck to the rigid truck. He ran a power lead to the dog trailer, which connected the blinkers, stop lights and tail lights of the tow-truck to the trailer. He attached a yellow reflective sign to the rear of the dog trailer. The sign was 1310mm wide and 806mm high and contained the words “OVERSIZE” in black lettering 200mm high and “TOWED VEHICLE” in black lettering 159mm high (the sign). The respondent’s tow-truck with the rigid truck and dog trailer in tow was 33m long (references to the respondent’s vehicle are to the tow-truck with the two vehicles in tow). 28 The collision occurred at a point about 4.3 kilometres south of Pheasant’s Nest near the Avon Dam Road interchange at Bargo (the Bargo exit). The Hume Highway between Pheasant’s Nest and the Bargo exit consisted of two lanes for southbound traffic separated from two lanes for northbound traffic by a wide median strip covered with foliage. The speed limit for ordinary vehicles was 110 km/h. Heavy vehicles such as the appellant’s vehicle were subject to a limit of 100 km/h. The speed limit that applied to the respondent was 80 km/h because he had a vehicle under tow. 29 By the time the respondent’s vehicle left the access lane from the service centre and joined the highway it was travelling at about 10 to 15 km/h. The highway was subject to a slight incline from the service centre to the Bargo exit. The respondent’s vehicle weighed around 70 tonnes, this and the gradient made it necessary for him to increase speed gradually. At the point of the collision the respondent was travelling at about 35 km/h. The Judge accepted that this was the fastest speed the respondent had been able to achieve in the circumstances. 
     
      
    30 The collision occurred at about 9.10am.  
     
      
    31 The respondent first became aware of the collision when he felt a jarring sensation and looked in the mirror and saw the trailer on its side with sand coming off it. He applied his brakes and stopped within a short interval. When he alighted from his tow-truck he saw that the rigid truck was upright but the dog trailer had rolled over to the left and was lying on its side.  
     
      
    32 Sergeant Kane of the Mittagong Highway Patrol attended the accident. He observed damage to the front offside of the appellant’s prime mover and to the left rear corner of the dog trailer. He measured skid marks on the surface of Lane 1. These consisted of two sets of lines running north south and measuring 14m. Sergeant Kane assumed that the marks had been made by the appellant’s vehicle since the respondent had not applied his brakes prior to the collision. In his opinion the marks were consistent with having been deposited by the dual rear wheels of the appellant’s prime mover when the appellant applied the brakes. 
     
      
    33 Approximately 4.3 kilometres south of the Pheasant’s Nest service centre the Bargo exit lane opens to the left of Lane 1 at an angle of about 30 degrees. White painted road markings separate the exit lane from the highway and can be seen in the photographs attached to the Austrace Report (Blue 331). Beyond the Bargo exit, about 4.6 kilometres from the Pheasant’s Nest service centre, there is an overpass across the highway. Sergeant Kane put the point of the collision as 350m north of the overpass. The skid marks ended at a point that was approximately in line with the apex of the V shaped road markings at the commencement of the Bargo exit. The point of impact was 5m south of this position.  
     
      
    34 The point of impact described by Sergeant Kane, and which is visible in the recording taken by a television news cameraman from a helicopter, shows that the appellant’s vehicle had passed beyond the marked point of commencement of the Bargo exit. The highway is straight for a stretch of 700m before the Bargo exit.  
     
      
    35 There were at least two witnesses to the collision. Statements made by each were in evidence. Mr Hackshall, who was travelling about 50 metres behind the appellant’s vehicle told the police at the scene that, “when near the turnoff to Bargo, I saw a truck veer to the left as if he was going to take the exit. Suddenly he veered back to the right. It wasn’t a gradual move. It was sharp move to the right.” (Black 220.F-220.G-H)36 Elizabeth Ross was driving a Jeep Cherokee south on the highway at the time. She made a statement on 27 March 2003, which was tendered in the respondent’s case (exhibit “7”, Blue 11-14). Her account of the collision was as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “About 8.45am that morning, I was about 20 minutes north of Bowral at Bargo and I believe that I was travelling in the nearside lane, that is the lane closest to the left of the road. I was travelling at a speed of about 110 kph and I had it on cruise control. The traffic was light at that part of the journey and the weather was good and it was a clear morning. It was not raining at that time and I think the road surface was dry. From reasonably far back, I saw ahead travelling in the same lane, a large vehicle but I did not realise from that distance if in fact he was towing another vehicle. I was aware that the truck was going slow and it was travelling up a slight slope. I was not aware from that distance how many vehicles were travelling in that lane at that time.  
        
       
       
        
        I can recall overtaking one or two vehicles that were travelling in the same lane that I was travelling and I believe that I then remained in the second lane. I cannot recall at this point in time, what I had seen as I came closer to the truck travelling in the left lane. I cannot recall if there were a number of vehicles. I can recall that when I was slightly to the rear of a truck, that might have been a tow-truck, I should move to the right lane to allow a truck travelling in the left lane behind the other truck to allow it to overtake the truck in front as the first truck was travelling very slowly. I believe that the first truck may have been travelling less than 40 kph.  
        
       
       
        
        I am not sure where I was in relation to these trucks and I thought that the second truck was leaving his move to the right lane rather late. It may have been that I sensed an accident was about to happen and I drove onto the grass verge in the centre of the road and slowed down my vehicle to become stationary. Before I became stationary, I heard an extremely loud bang and there was a lot of dust and dirt thrown up on my left.” (Blue 12.N-13.Q) 
        
       
      
    37 On a conservative estimate 98 vehicles would have passed the respondent’s vehicle in the course of the journey from the service centre to the Bargo exit.  
     
      
    38 The respondent did not have the hazard lights turned on as he drove. He believed that it was unlawful to drive with them switched on.  
     
      
       
      The appellant’s evidence  
      
    39 The appellant gave evidence that he had been driving south on the highway in Lane 1. The road was wet. The traffic was moderate to heavy. There were vehicles in Lanes 1 and 2 southbound. Before coming to the Bargo exit he had been travelling at around 85 to 95 kph. A car travelling in front of his vehicle pulled out in order to overtake and he then saw the respondent’s vehicle. At this point the respondent’s vehicle was about 150m in front of him and he was gaining on it. He looked to see if he could overtake it, but this was not possible as there was another vehicle either passing him or close to passing him. He was aware that he was bearing down on the truck which appeared to be “barely moving”. (Black 57.D) By the time he realised this he was somewhere less than 100m behind it. He was coming up towards the Bargo turn-off and he thought that he would be able to miss the truck and go up the left-hand side of it. He applied his brakes, but he had to be careful because the road was wet and his vehicle was moderately loaded, and there was the risk of tipping the trailer over. It developed a little bit of a wobble and he so took his foot off the brake. It was at this point that he thought his best option was to go up the left-hand side. He did not recall the collision. His last memory was, “I thought I was going to miss it”. (Black 62.D)  
     
      
    40 In cross-examination the appellant agreed that he had an elevated view from the cab of his prime mover. He simply had not seen the respondent’s vehicle over the first 550m of straight road heading towards Bargo. He had been focussing on the vehicle in front of him, looking in his mirrors and watching the traffic around him. He had not noticed the sign on the rear of the respondent’s vehicle. He acknowledged his awareness that a large yellow sign on the back of a towed unit was a warning that the vehicle was not only under tow, but was also likely to be travelling at a lesser speed than the following traffic.  
     
      
       
      The conditions of the respondent’s permit 
      
    41 Attached to the report of Mr Joy, a traffic engineer who was called in the appellant’s case, is a copy of a publication titled “Operators Guide to Oversize Vehicle Movements for non-Agricultural Vehicles and Mobile Cranes” which appears to have been issued by the Roads and Traffic Authority. The guide records that annual permits are required for the operation of heavy tow trucks (tow-trucks with a gross combination mass of 18,000 kg or more or which become oversize when towing disabled vehicles). The respondent was the holder of a heavy tow truck permit at the date of the collision (the permit). His vehicle conformed to the conditions of the permit.  
     
      
    42 The conditions of the permit provided for the display of signs and the use of flashing lights:  
     
      
       
        
        “6. A sign must be secured in a clearly visible position at the rear of the “towed vehicle” at all times whilst it is being towed. This sign must: 
        
       
      
    · be of a durable and waterproof material of minimum dimensions 1200 m x 300 mm 
     
      
    · have a yellow 10 mm edge strip and a black 20 mm wide border 
     
      
    · have black lettering complying with Australian Standards AS 1743 and 1744 on a fluorescent yellow retroreflective background complying with Australian Standard AS1906 (Part 1 – 1990 class 1 or 2)  
     
      
    · display the words “TOWED VEHICLE” in at least 150 mm high Series CN lettering  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          Note: (This sign may be combined with the “OVERSIZE” sign outlined in condition 7.) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          7. An “OVERSIZE” sign must be displayed as set out in the “Handbook for the movement of overdimension vehicles”. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Note: (This sign may be combined with the “TOWED VEHICLE” sign outlined in condition 6.) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          8. All stop and direction turn indicator signal lamps fitted to the “towed vehicle” must be operational from the towing vehicle at all times or a portable light board which is operational from the towing vehicle must be secured to the rear of the “towed vehicle”. Additionally, between sunset and sunrise and at times of restricted visibility, all operational clearance, side marker and tail lamps are to be lit and in the case of a damaged/defective vehicle, emergency side lamps must be fitted and operational at intervals no greater than 6 metres.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    43 The sign attached to the respondent’s vehicle was 2.5 times the area of the sign specified in the conditions of his permit. 
     
      
      The expert evidence 
      
    44 The appellant’s particulars of negligence included the failure to warn sufficiently or at all of the presence of the tow-truck and its load on the motorway. (emphasis added) (Red 3.T) Mr Joy and Mr Johnston, the two traffic engineers who were retained on the appellant’s behalf, were instructed that the respondent’s vehicle did not display a warning sign. At the trial it was accepted that the sign had been attached to the rear of the respondent’s vehicle.  
     
      
    45 Mr Joy reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the context of the incident involving Mr Kollas, the most pertinent condition is the requirement that a heavy vehicle which is under tow must be fitted with a sign of specified type and size affixed to the rear-most end of the towed unit which indicates it is being towed, and any other relevant aspects, such as if it is over- length (in combination with the tow-truck), or over-width. (Blue 124.U-W) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        There appears to be no specific requirement in respect of heavy towing regulations to display any warning lights (such as beacons or hazard warning lights) during daytime towing operations. There is a requirement that all stop and turn indicators on the towed vehicle be operational from the towing vehicle or a temporary light board operational from the towing vehicle be installed.  
        
       
       
        
        Hazard warning lights actuate all the turn signal lights simultaneously. They provide a valuable, internationally-accepted and effective means of attracting attention of other drivers to a vehicle displaying them…(Blue 125.H-K) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
        In my opinion, given the comparatively low travel speed of the tow truck and the tipper and dog trailer it was towing on a high speed freeway, it constituted a traffic hazard, which warranted the hazard warning lights of the towed vehicle being activated to draw attention of the drivers of following vehicles to it and so warn them of the hazard it posed.” (Blue 125.Q-R) 
        
       
      
    46 Mr Joy understood that the applicable rule governing the use of hazard lights was r 221 of the Australian Road Rules (the ARR). He acknowledged in cross-examination his belief that the respondent may have exposed himself to liability for breach of the rules had he driven with the hazard lights turned on. This did not alter Mr Joy’s opinion that safety required that the hazard lights be activated. 47 Mr Johnston made no reference to the need to use the hazard lights or other flashing lights in his report. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “[5.8] In my opinion, in this instance Mr Kollas was required to identify a hazard where he could see the involved vehicle for some distance, but was unable to realistically recognise it as a potential hazard until he has interpreted the large disparity in relative speeds (i.e. that he was closing on the vehicle much more rapidly than he first realised). In my experience, this would be one of a number of reasons why transport regulations require that a sign indicating “towed vehicle” and if necessary “oversize” be displayed on a fluorescent yellow sign on the rear of the trailer. It is also my experience that the rapid closure of following vehicles on slow moving vehicles (including those towing) is also the reason why such vehicles were originally prohibited from travelling on freeways. (Blue 234.R-W)” 
        
       
        
      
    48 In oral evidence Mr Johnston’s attention was directed to the concluding sentence of paragraph [5.28] of his report:  
     
      
       
        
        “[5.28] In my opinion, it is reasonable to expect the regular driver of a heavy recovery vehicle, such as Mr Scurrah, to be aware of the minimum requirements for the operation of such a vehicle in a recovery situation on a highspeed freeway. Moreover I would have expected Mr Scurrah to have been aware of the potential hazards associated with the low speed operation of his vehicle and the high differential speeds this creates with other road users. In light of these risks, I would expect it to be reasonable to assume that Mr Scurrah would have recognised the importance of meeting the minimum safety requirements at the very least and possibly have even considered the use of additional warnings for the benefit of both himself and other road users.” (Blue 243.I-O) 
        
       
       
      Mr Johnston was asked what additional warnings he had been referring to and he responded: 
       
       
        
        “The additional warnings were either the hazard lights on the truck or some sort of flashing light board which was powered from the tow vehicle.” (Black 353.J) 
        
       
       
      Mr Johnston considered that the use of additional warnings was appropriate because the highway was a high-speed environment with a high volume of traffic and because of the disparity between the speed of the traffic generally and the respondent’s vehicle.  
      
    49 Mr Johnston said that the rear of the dog trailer when viewed from behind on a straight stretch of road at a distance of about 150m would have looked much like any other vehicle. This was because the approaching driver would not have been able to see the tow-truck, which would have been blocked from view by the dog trailer. In the absence of passing vehicles Mr Johnston considered there would have been no frame of reference for the appellant to have identified the relatively slow speed of the towed combination. The only cue for the appellant in this circumstance would have been the “increasing visual size” of the rear of the trailer as he approached it. 50 Mr Johnston stated that had the respondent’s vehicle displayed a standard sign (which appears to have been a reference to a sign conforming to the minimum requirements of the permit conditions) and had a driver in the following vehicle been possessed of the minimum visual acuity required to hold a driver’s licence there would have been a sufficient distance from the position when the sign was legible to allow the driver to react and avoid collision.51 Mr McCaffrey, a traffic engineer, was called in the respondent’s case. He considered that the sign would have been legible at a distance of at least 100m. He said this:  
     
      
       
        
        “At 100 metres or more, the wording on the sign would have been legible to the driver. In this distance there was ample time for him to either position his vehicle in lane two, or if this was not possible due to faster vehicles in this lane, i.e. travelling at about 20 km/h above his speed of 90 km/h, there was ample time to using moderate braking to slow his vehicle down to the same speed of the towed vehicle. (Blue 342.R-U).  
         
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It is difficult to comprehend how an alert driver given these road conditions, could not distinguish a slow vehicle in lane one and position himself in lane two for passing purposes. If the driver decided to remain in lane one, there would have been ample distance to brake and slow down to the speed of the slower vehicle ahead, without resorting to severe braking action.” [Blue 283.S-U] 
        
       
      
    52 In Mr McCaffrey’s opinion, the activation of the hazard lights was not required. He said that in daylight the hazard lights would have been visible for around 100-150m. 53 Hazard warning lights are defined in the ARR as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        hazard warning lights  
        means a pair of yellow direction indicator lights fitted to a vehicle under another law of this jurisdiction that display regular flashes of light at the same time, and at the same rate, as each other, but does not include warning lights fitted, under another law of this jurisdiction, to a bus used for carrying children.”  
        
       
      
    54 The flashing emergency lights to which the amended particulars refer appears to be a reference to a flashing or rotating light (referred to on occasions as a beacon) mounted on the top of the vehicle as an emergency light. These are lights which may be fitted to certain types of motor vehicle under Clause 123 of Schedule 4 to the Road Transport (Vehicle Registration) Regulation 1998 (the Registration Regulation).  
     
      
    55 The respondent did not have “emergency light equipment” attached to his tow-truck. It was his practice to connect the tail-lights, brake lights and “flashers” [the indicator lights] from his tow-truck to the towed vehicle. (Black 278.P) He carried a portable light board with stoplights, tail lights and blinker lights, which could be attached to a towed vehicle whose lights were inoperable.56 The reference in Mr Johnston’s evidence to a “flashing light board which was powered from the tow vehicle” (Black 353.J) was not further explained. Mr Johnston had not known at the time of his report whether the hazard lights on the dog trailer had been connected to the respondent’s tow-truck. In the context of the examination, which the Judge sets out in her reasons, it would seem that he was referring to a portable set of lights capable of operating as hazard lights and not to a flashing light or rotating light of the kind referred to in clause 123(4) of the Registration Regulation, which I will refer to as a “flashing emergency light”.  
     
      
    57 The appellant had seen tow-trucks displaying flashing lights in daylight. His evidence appears to have been directed to the use of flashing emergency lights.  
     
      
    58 Sergeant Kane, in his report of the accident, stated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Vehicle two was travelling at an unusually slow speed in a 110 km/h area. In my opinion this is a contributing factor. There is no evidence of hazard lights operation on Veh. 2 and although this vehicle had a sign on the rear of the dog trailer I still believe it contributed to the collision.” (Blue 145.R-U) 
        
       
      
    59 Sergeant Kane had seen vehicles under tow with their hazard lights activated while travelling in the daytime.   
     
      
      The Regulations 
       
      
    60 There was some confusion at the trial concerning the regulatory regime which governs the use of hazard lights. It will be recalled that Mr Joy understood that r 221 of the ARR applied. 61 The ARR are part of a national scheme of uniform road rules. They are incorporated into the law of New South Wales by clause 6 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) (Road Rules) Regulation 1999 (the Regulation). However, by operation of clause 7 and clause 14 of Schedule 1 of the Regulation, r 221 of the ARR does not apply to the driver of any vehicle in New South Wales.  
     
      
    62 Clause 55 of the Regulation governs the use of lights on motor vehicles and deals with flashing lights in sub-clause (d) and hazard lights in sub-clause (e). Relevantly, the provision is in these terms:

          may be equipped with a device that will cause the direction indicator lights fitted to the front and rear and on both sides of the vehicle, and any trailer connected to the vehicle, to flash simultaneously and regularly at a rate of not less than 60 and not more than 120 flashes per minute. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) When all such lights fitted to a motor vehicle and trailer (if any) are flashing simultaneously, there must be an indicator that will inform the driver, by visible and audible means, that the lights are flashing.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    65 It will be noted that clause 55(d)(i), which is concerned with flashing emergency lights, speaks of moving “in hazardous circumstances” whereas clause 55(e), which is concerned with hazard lights, speaks of moving “in hazardous conditions”. The Judge considered “hazardous circumstances” to refer to factors relating to traffic such as congestion, speed and volume and features of the vehicle such as weight or defects and “hazardous conditions” to refer to factors such as road surface (condition), weather, external features affecting the control of vehicles such as concealed gaps, obstacles, or factors affecting manoeuvrability such as narrow, steep or treacherous carriageway. Nonetheless her Honour approached each formulation on the basis that it embraced “the full range of meanings that might be assigned to either”. (Red 38.T) She concluded that the respondent’s vehicle was not moving in either “hazardous circumstances” or “hazardous conditions” and was thus not exempt from the prohibition on the use of flashing emergency lights or hazard lights.  
     
      
    66 On the hearing of the appeal senior counsel for the appellant drew attention to Part 4 of Schedule 4 of the Registration Regulation which deals with the dimension of vehicles. Clause 73 governs the length of combinations. A combination is defined to mean a group of vehicles consisting of a motor vehicle connected to one or more vehicles. Relevantly, clause 73(1) prescribes a length of 19m for combinations such as the combination that the respondent was driving. The respondent’s vehicle exceeded the length limits of the Schedule. Counsel submitted that the exemption in clause 55(d)(iii) applied to the respondent’s vehicle and that he had not been subject to the prohibition on the use of flashing emergency lights. In a note submitted after the hearing senior counsel for the respondent accepted that the prohibition in clause 55(d) did not apply to the respondent’s vehicle.  
     
      
    67 Thus, contrary to the way the matter was put at trial and contrary to the Judge’s finding, the respondent was not precluded by the Regulation from the use of a flashing emergency light attached to his vehicle.  
     
      
      The grounds of appeal 
      
    68 The appellant relies on 17 grounds of appeal, many of which challenge factual findings. The principal challenge to the Judge’s approach to fact finding is Ground 1, which complains of her acceptance of the appellant’s evidence in light of her more general findings as to his reliability. This asserted error is said to infect a number of findings that are the subject of other grounds.  
     
      
    69 The factual findings that are the subject of complaint are prominent in the Judge’s consideration of causation. The anterior question is whether the appellant proved that the respondent was in breach of the duty of care, which he admittedly owed to him as a user of the highway. The Judge found that he was not. Her finding in this respect is the subject of Ground 2. 
     
      
       
      “ 
      Ground 2  
       
        
         
          
          Her Honour erred in 
          
         
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) failing to properly consider the negligence issue in the context of the duty of care which the Defendant owed to the foreseeable class of road users travelling from behind, including those who were inadvertent or themselves not taking reasonable care; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) instead determining the issue of the Defendant’s negligence by reference to the particular manner in which her Honour found the Plaintiff reacted to the risk of collision caused by the defendant’s slow moving vehicles.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    70 The Judge delivered lengthy reasons very shortly after the completion of the trial, which substantially focus on issues of causation. The analysis of breach is brief and conclusory. Her Honour identified the duty in terms which do not suggest the error asserted in (a) above. She said that the respondent owed the appellant as a driver on the highway a duty of care, which was not reduced by any failure on the appellant’s part “to exercise care in his own case”. (Red 44.T) She went on immediately to say, “But duty is not the same as causation” and to return to the evidence on that topic. (Red 44.U). The finding that the respondent was not in breach was simply stated at the end of the reasons. (Red 47.G) There is force to the criticism which is articulated in Ground 2(b). The analysis of the appellant’s case in negligence was largely directed to issues of causation.  
     
      
    71 This Court is in as good a position as the trial Judge to decide whether the inference to be drawn from the facts, which are not in issue, is that the respondent was negligent. To the extent that the expert evidence bears relevantly on the determination of this question it was not suggested that the assessment of it depended on issues of credibility. In written submissions filed on the appellant’s behalf it was stated that this Court should determine the facts (save that it should not give effect to the findings that are the subject of challenge in the grounds of appeal). (Orange 4.D-F) On the hearing of the appeal counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial had miscarried such that the proper order was for a new trial (T 18.55). Counsel subsequently acknowledged that, in so far as the determination of breach was concerned, there was no reason why the matter should not be dealt with by this Court. (T 21.1-7) It is appropriate to do so.  
     
      
    72 The respondent owed a duty to take reasonable care for the safety of the appellant as a fellow user of the highway. The question is whether the appellant established that the reasonable response of a prudent driver towing an oversize vehicle slowly on a highway to the risk (that following vehicles may not appreciate how slowly his vehicle was travelling and be unable to avoid colliding with it) required the activation of the hazard lights and/or a flashing emergency light. In approaching this determination it is to be borne in mind that the Court is concerned with the reasonableness of the response looked at prospectively and not with hindsight: State of New South Wales v Fahy [2007] HCA 20; 81 ALJR 1021 per Gummow J and Hayne J at 1034-5 [57] – [58].  
     
      
    73 The appellant submits that her Honour erred in concluding that the respondent’s vehicle was not moving in “hazardous conditions” on this day. This is the subject of Ground 12. The written submissions in support of this ground do no more than assert that there were hazardous conditions and that the Judge took an unduly narrow view of the provision. (Orange 50.H – O) Since the question of whether the respondent was permitted to drive with the hazard lights turned on is relevant to the assessment of what reasonable care required, it is appropriate to consider this ground at this point.  
     
      
    74 In my opinion, the expression “hazardous conditions” in sub clause 55(e) is directed to external factors which would include weather; road surface; road works or obstacles on the roadway and the like and not the manner in which the vehicle is being driven. In this case there was conflicting evidence about whether the road surface was wet. The Judge did not resolve the conflict. I will assume that it was. It was daylight. It was not raining. The respondent was driving on a straight stretch of dual lane highway. Accepting that he was driving slowly in comparison with the flow of traffic and that his vehicle was oversize, I do not consider that he was moving in hazardous conditions for the purposes of clause 55(e) of the Regulation. 
     
      
    75 Counsel for the respondent submitted that a flashing emergency light on the tow-truck would not have been visible to following vehicles because the rigid truck and the dog trailer would have obscured it from view. (The rigid truck was raised off its front wheels by the tow-truck’s hoist). In his submission clause 123(4) of the Regulation permitted the attachment of a flashing emergency light to the tow-truck but not to the rigid truck or dog trailer. “Vehicle” is defined in clause 15 of the ARR to include “a combination”. This definition is to be read as if forming part of the Regulation. In my opinion clause 123(4) permitted the attachment of a flashing emergency light to any part of the respondent’s vehicle: sub-clause (k) refers to vehicles exceeding the length limits of Schedule 4.76 I approach consideration of the reasonable response of the driver of a vehicle such as this on the basis that the respondent was prohibited from driving with the hazard lights activated and that he was permitted to drive with a flashing emergency light attached to the top of his vehicle. The determination of what reasonable care requires in a given case is not resolved by asking whether the omission is, or is not, prohibited by the ARR or the Regulation. However the fact that conduct is prohibited may be one factor pointing to the conclusion that reasonable care did not require it. 77 There is no minimum speed for vehicles travelling on the highway and slow vehicles travel on it from time to time. Some slow-moving vehicles such as bicycles or vintage cars are readily identifiable as such. The feature of the respondent’s vehicle, which is said to have required the activation of the hazard or flashing emergency lights is that at a distance there was nothing to alert a following driver to its slow speed (apart from the sign). 78 Counsel for the respondent submitted that the hazard lights on the dog trailer were unlikely to have any greater impact from the perspective of an approaching driver than the sign. This is because the hazard lights were located just above the mudguards in a position that was considerably less prominent than the sign. The hazard lights were visible in daylight at a distance of 100 to 150m. The sign was legible at a distance of at least 100m. In these circumstances reasonable care, it is said, did not require their activation. There is merit in that submission. 79 The particulars of negligence were amended at the end of the trial to include the failure to use flashing emergency lights. There was little attention directed to flashing emergency lights in the course of the evidence. The appellant challenges the Judge’s assessment of the evidence of Mr Joy and Mr Johnston insofar as she considered that each supported the use of the hazard lights but not flashing emergency lights (Ground 10). Mr Joy did not refer to flashing lights. The Judge’s reasons for concluding that Mr Johnston’s evidence which I have set out at [48] was directed to a portable light board and not to flashing emergency lights is compelling. (Red 40.L-41.J) 
     
      
    80 The appellant’s counsel submitted that Mr Kelly, the driver of the disabled rigid truck, had given evidence which was supportive of the use of flashing emergency lights. I do not read Mr Kelly’s evidence going so far. His evidence on this topic was as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. As an experienced truck driver, do you from time to time on the highway and have you from time to time on the highway, come across situations where you see flashing emergency lights? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. I won’t deal with the whole range of situations where that may occur, but do you agree that to any experienced driver such as yourself, that puts you on immediate alert as to a hazardous situation where you have to be particularly careful. Is that right? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you agree that the advantage of having emergency lights – let’s forget about whatever the situation is, is that it is a very common method – it’s clear that your attention has to be directed to the situation immediately? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that the source of any hazard is where the flashing lights are. Correct? 
         
        A. Yes.” (Black 300.V-Y-301.B-H) 
        
       
      
    81 As I have noted, the appellant gave evidence of his experience of seeing tow-trucks with flashing emergency lights operating in daylight. As I understand the appellant’s counsel’s submission it is that Mr Joy and Mr Johnston both supported the need for some form of flashing light because a flashing light (be it a hazard light or an flashing emergency light of the type contemplated by clause 55(d) of the Regulation) is a well recognised means of alerting road users to a danger. I approach the expert evidence on that footing and mindful that a flashing emergency light conforming to the requirements of clause 123(7) of the Registration Regulation would have been visible in daylight at a distance of 200m whereas the sign was legible at least 100m. 82 I do not find that the appellant established that the respondent was in breach of his duty of care by his failure to have a flashing emergency light on his vehicle or to activate the hazard lights. (I am of this opinion even if, contrary to the conclusion stated in [74], the Regulation did not prohibit the use of hazard lights in these conditions.) In coming to this conclusion I have regard to the following considerations. 
     
      
    83 The respondent’s vehicle conformed to the conditions of his permit. Those conditions required that a reflective sign be displayed on the rear of the vehicle stating that it was oversize and under tow. The sign which the respondent attached to his vehicle was 2.5 times the area of the sign that the condition of his permit required.  
     
      
    84 The conditions of the permit with respect to the use of flashing lights were directed to night-time driving and this was a daylight tow.  
     
      
    85 The road was wet but it was not raining and there was no obstacle to visibility. 
     
      
    86 The respondent was travelling slowly on a multi-lane highway in moderate traffic such that his vehicle was regularly being passed by vehicles that were travelling at a faster speed. This is significant because Mr Johnston’s opinion, that approaching drivers would not have a frame of reference to judge the respondent’s speed from a distance, was posited on the absence of passing traffic.  
     
      
    87 I do not agree that the sign did not serve to alert following traffic to the fact that the respondent’s vehicle was travelling slowly. Information that a vehicle is oversize and under tow as a matter of common sense is information suggestive of the probability that it is travelling slowly.  
     
      
    88 The appearance and dimensions of the sign were such as to put following drivers on notice of the features of the respondent’s vehicle that made it a potential hazard including that it was likely to be travelling at a speed considerably less than the 110km/h speed limit.  
     
      
    89 At a distance of 100m a driver had ample opportunity to take steps to avoid colliding with the respondent’s vehicle.  
     
      
    90 Taking into account these considerations I have concluded that driving on this road in the conditions on this day did not require a reasonably prudent driver do more to alert following drivers to the risk posed by reason of the vehicle’s slow speed relative to other traffic than the respondent did.  
     
      
      Causation 
      
    91 In case I am wrong in my conclusion that the respondent was not in breach of the duty that he owed to the appellant, I will address the Judge’s finding on causation, which is the subject of a number of the remaining grounds of appeal. 92 The Judge’s reasons for holding that the respondent’s failure to activate the hazard lights and/or to use an emergency flashing light was not in law a cause of the collision, may be summarised as follows. The appellant had been travelling on a straight stretch of highway, behind the respondent’s vehicle over a considerable distance before he first observed it. He was seated in an elevated position in the cabin of his prime mover and there was no obstacle to him seeing the back of the respondent’s vehicle over the top of the car, which was immediately in front of him. He concentrated his attention on that car and did not see the respondent’s vehicle until the car pulled out into Lane 2 to overtake it. At this point the appellant was around 150m behind the respondent’s vehicle. He appreciated that the vehicle was travelling slowly and that he was closing on it. He was familiar with signs, such as the sign which was attached to the respondent’s vehicle and he understood that a vehicle displaying such a sign was likely to be travelling slowly. He had not seen the sign. His failure to see the sign was unexplained. In these circumstances it was unlikely that he would have noticed hazard lights or a flashing light on the respondent’s vehicle.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
        
        “1. Her Honour, having found that the Plaintiff had: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) ‘fallacy of memory’; 
           
           
          (b) an erratic, disorganised and unreliable recollection of the events involved in the accident; 
           
           
          (c) a memory which was a composition of assumptions from his general practice, what he was told and what he had come to believe in his personal attempt to understand what had happened to him, and 
           
           
          (d) effectively no relevant recollection of the circumstances of the actual collision; and 
           
           
          (e) a version of events into which distortions had entered over time as he has tried to make sense of that which he cannot recall and cannot explain, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        erred in then proceeding to make findings of fact which were adverse to the Plaintiff, as to how the accident happened, and which were based upon reasoning which used the evidence and instructions the Plaintiff gave as to the circumstances of the accident (including his observations, estimated distances, the sequence of events, time intervals and his thoughts prior to the accident), when such findings of fact and reasoning were inconsistent with findings (a)-(e) inclusive above.”  
        
       
      
    93 The Judge’s reasons that give rise to this ground are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Witnesses and reliability  
        
       
       
        
        The evidence of witnesses must be assessed with care having regard to their reliability. Particular need for that assessment is inspired by the fallacy of memory, in the case of the plaintiff; and by lack of expertise in the case of Mr McCaw. I am, however, satisfied that all the witnesses were honest and frank and each was doing his level best to be candid with the Court.  
        
       
       
        
        The plaintiff says that he has a recollection of events up to a certain point, but that it cuts out before the actual collision. He admits to various gaps in his recollection of events earlier in the day, including his time of departure. That has always been so. As early as the day after the accident, the plaintiff was conscious of his gaps in his recollection, and commented on this in the hospital. On various occasions in hospital, the plaintiff professed no recollection of events, and he failed some of the post-traumatic amnesia testing. When he spoke with the police the day after the accident, he had no recollection. Sergeant Kane recorded in his notebook:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘8.50am on the 3/3/01, I attend Liverpool District Hospital. Speak to Bill Kollas. Unable to recall what happened.’  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The plaintiff is frank about these gaps in his recollection. In cross-examination he agreed that he is unsure as to when he left home; when he arrived at the Flemington Markets; when he left to start the trip on which he came to grief. To some extent he believes that he set out from Flemington because “I must have went there”, and saying that “I don’t have a recollection but I’m assuming that I was there.” He does not recall the start of the trip, nor any telephone call he had made to his parents the night before. His recollection of the actual trip is patchy at best.  
        
       
       
        
        He does not recall precisely where he collided with the rear of the defendant’ towed vehicle. It is implicit in the plaintiff’s evidence that he believes that the point of impact was just short of the Bargo exit, to which he says he was heading in the attempt to avoid running into the rear of the defendant’s conglomerate vehicle:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘I was coming up towards the Bargo turn-off and there’s an off-ramp and I thought I’d be able to miss the vehicle, go up the left-hand side of it. … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I thought the best option was to go up the left-hand side. … I went to the left.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          However, that is not in fact where the collision occurred. The plaintiff's vehicle had passed the mouth of the Bargo exit when he ran into the rear of the defendant’s vehicle; and the point of impact was some five metres to the south of the southern side of the Bargo exit. He was not “coming up towards the Bargo turn-off.” He missed it. He does not recall the actual collision or the contact between his vehicle and the rear of the defendant’ towed vehicle. He does not recall being trapped in his own vehicle, or the helicopter trip to the hospital and on the day of the accident he did not know that he had even been in an accident.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I find that the plaintiff’s recollection is patchy and erratic to the point of being unreliable. I find that the plaintiff has, to a large degree, pieced together what he thinks happened from a composite of what other people have told him (including what they tell him he told them) and his rather patchy recollections. I find no dishonesty in that. I accept that he was doing his best frankly to relate that which he believes he now recalls. However, I find that his memory is a composition of that which he assumes from his general practice, that which he has been told and that which over time he has come to believe in his personal attempt to understand what happened to him. Some parts of that recollection may be derived from that which he himself narrated. For example, although he does not have any actual recollection of this, his father has told him that he made a telephone call to him (his father) from the vehicle after the accident while still trapped in the vehicle.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Although, for the reasons discussed below, I do not accept that the plaintiff's recollection is reliable, I do find that he is a frank and honest witness who did his utmost to testify as to that which he believed occurred. He was a frank witness, within the confines of his unreliable recollection; and underplayed rather than exaggerated any resulting pain, suffering, restriction or incapacity, being stoic, and simply getting on with the job despite the difficulties he faces. However, he was involved in a very serious accident, in which he sustained significant injuries. I find that his recollection of the events involved in the accident is erratic, disorganised and unreliable.’” (Red 10.I-11.H) 
          
         
        
       
      
    94 In written submissions the challenge is put this way:  
     
      
       
        
        “Her Honour found that because of the head injuries the Plaintiff sustained, he was an unreliable witness and had no actual memory of the events of the accident. However, notwithstanding this finding, her Honour then based her reasons and findings against the Plaintiff’s case upon what the Plaintiff stated in evidence that he remembered doing. This involved her Honour treating (unconsciously) false evidence as true, and unreliable evidence as reliable. If the Plaintiff was unreliable and had no memory, it was obvious error to make findings against him by relying upon his false memory of what had occurred.” (Orange 2.L-S) 
        
       
      
    95 The appellant gave this evidence in chief:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. As you came up along lane one you say you saw a truck? 
         
        A. I just – I was following the traffic; there were vehicles beside me, vehicles in front of me. A vehicle pulled out and then I’ve spotted a truck in front of me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you say a vehicle has pulled out, where was that vehicle? 
         
        A. It was in front of me further ahead.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. In lane one? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. So a vehicle pulled out in front of you and went – lane two? 
         
        A. Yes, to overtake.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall what sort of vehicle that was? 
         
        A. Just a car; I’m not very sure.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. When that moved out of the way what did you see? 
         
        A. The rear of a truck. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Approximately how far away were you from that truck? 
         
        A. About 150 metres.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you saw that truck – what could you see? 
         
        A. Just the rear – I was gaining on the rear of a truck. There was nothing that really stuck out in my mind. Yes – and that it was going slow.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was it travelling wholly within lane one? 
         
        A. Yes, only in lane one.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you do? 
         
        A. First, I looked in my right-hand mirror to see if I could overtake. That wasn’t possible, there was another vehicle that was either passing me or close to passing me. Then I more or less looked ahead again and I’m bearing down on this thing that’s barely moving.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. So by the stage when you saw that vehicle barely moving, approximately how far away were you from it? 
         
        A. I was closing on it very quickly. Somewhere – less than a hundred metres to go.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when you saw it barely moving, what did you do? 
         
        A. The first thing I did – once I knew I couldn’t pass I applied my brakes as much as I could without putting my combination into a wobble, and then I thought I would be able to shoot up the left-hand side of the vehicle.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. What do you mean “shoot up the left-hand side of the vehicle”? 
         
        A. I was coming up towards the Bargo turn-off and there’s an off ramp and I thought I’d be able to miss the vehicle, go up the left-hand side of it.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. You said that you applied the brakes. What was the problem about applying the brakes there? 
         
        A. Because the road was wet and because I was moderately loaded, if you apply the brakes too hard in a sort of combination there’s a chance that you tip the trailer over. (Black 56.L – 57.N) 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you endeavoured to take what I call the Bargo turnoff …  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: It’s more the runoff, isn’t it? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Like an off ramp it is actually.  
        
       
       
        
        GROSS: I’ll call it the off ramp. When you endeavoured to take the Bargo off ramp, did that involve much of a deviation to the left? 
         
        A. A little bit, yes.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. You can take it that there was contact between you and the …  
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION Question not pressed.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember the impact itself, or any impact between your vehicle and any other vehicle? 
         
        A. No.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. What is your next recollection of matters in terms of where you were – when you were next aware of where you were? 
         
        A. When I was in hospital.” (Black 57.S-58.E) 
        
       
      
    96 In cross-examination the appellant confirmed that he had an actual memory of driving along in the left-hand lane doing between 85 to 95 km/h. (Black 142.E) 
     
      
    97 The appellant’s evidence that he had seen the respondent’s vehicle when he was about 150 metres behind it was not challenged. He was however challenged along these lines: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can I suggest to you that your entire memory of the events of this collision is very uncertain? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. You have a very certain memory of it all, do you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Not all of it.” (Black 144.H-J) 
        
       
      
    98 The cross-examination continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. On the day of the accident, when you had your accident, you can’t remember the actual collision itself, can you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. What part do you mean?  
        
       
       
        
        Q. The contact between the two vehicles. You don’t remember that happening, do you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No. The last thing I remember was thinking I missed it.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t remember being trapped in the vehicle, do you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t remember the helicopter trip to the hospital, do you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. So on the day of your accident you didn’t know that you’d even been in an accident. Isn’t that right? You only worked that out some time later? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, that’s correct.  
        
       
       
        
        Q. Certainly on the day of the accident you didn’t know that you’d been involved in an accident with a towed vehicle that was travelling in front of you, did you? 
        
       
       
        
        A. No, that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Someone must have told you that later on? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes.” (Black 147.F-R) 
        
       
      
    99 The injuries that the appellant suffered in the collision were abdominal injuries, the fracture of his right leg and lacerations to his nose. The medical evidence was consistent with him suffering a period of amnesia from just before the impact. (Blue 82)100 The Judge rejected those parts of the appellant’s evidence that related to events immediately before the collision and which were inconsistent with other evidence; that he had been heading to the Bargo exit at the time of the collision and that he had released the brakes of his vehicle in an endeavour to stop it becoming unstable. The Judge found that were some eight seconds between the time the appellant said that he saw the respondent’s vehicle and the impact. (Red 16.C) It is only if one reads the Judge’s reference to “the events involved in the accident” as embracing events eights seconds earlier, when the appellant was 150m or thereabouts behind the respondent’s vehicle, that her findings may be thought inconsistent. 101 Reading her reasons as a whole I understand the Judge to have accepted the appellant’s evidence that he had a recollection of events up to a point and that his recollection cut out before the actual collision. This is consistent with her finding that “the plaintiff does not recall the collision as such” at the commencement of the judgment (Red 8.G) and the later finding, “I find that the plaintiff has effectively no relevant recollection of the circumstances of the actual collision, believing that the accident occurred short of the Bargo exit, not just past it”. (emphasis added). (Red 39.E-F) It was open to the Judge to accept the appellant’s evidence of his observations at the time he first saw the respondent’s vehicle and to reject his evidence of the events immediately prior to the collision.  
     
      
    102 An alternative submission advanced by counsel for the appellant on the hearing was that the Judge’s reasons were inadequate in that they did not serve to explain why she accepted parts of the appellant’s account of events around the time of the collision given her finding that his recollection was patchy, erratic and that his evidence was unreliable. That criticism needs to be assessed in light of the issues that were live in the trial. The appellant’s evidence on matters, such as the distance at which he had first seen the respondent’s vehicle, was not the subject of challenge. Counsel for the appellant opened on the basis that the appellant had first become aware of the respondent’s vehicle and when it was about 150m ahead of him and that it was a slow-moving vehicle. (Black 14.L) Counsel went on to give an account that the appellant had attempted to take the run off [to Bargo] and that his vehicle had clipped the respondent’s vehicle. Counsel said (at Blue 15.J-P): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is some inconsistency of recollection expressed by the plaintiff, concerning those matters. Ultimately, he doesn’t remember the events from when he collides with the other vehicle – he doesn’t actually remember the collision itself and he doesn’t remember up to when he is in hospital. Your Honour, he suffers very severe abdominal injuries, his leg is trapped, he can’t bring to mind in effect … It’s not a brain injury case or anything like that, your Honour.”  
        
       
      
    103 The Judge’s reasons were directed to explaining why, notwithstanding her assessment that the appellant was an honest witness, she did not accept his evidence on matters immediately preceding the collision. She may not have seen the need to explain her acceptance of those parts of his case that he had invited her to accept and which the respondent had not put in issue. Ground 1 should be rejected.  
     
      
    104 The balance of the 17 grounds of appeal involve challenges to the Judge’s fact finding, variously asserting failure to accord significance to matters that the appellant submits were significant or according too much significance to matters that the appellant submits did not deserve weight. They challenge the Judge’s determination of the issue of causation. None raise a ground for successful challenge to the findings, which I have summarised at paragraph [92] upon which the Judge concluded this issue against the appellant. That conclusion was well open on the facts that the Judge found. If the complaint in ground 1 were made good, in my opinion it would not alter the result. This is because the circumstances giving rise to the collision would be unexplained. All that would be known are the physical facts of the collision – taken with such inferences as may be drawn from the accounts of Mr Hackshall and Ms Ross. The front right-hand section of the cabin of the appellant’s vehicle clipped the left-hand rear side of the dog trailer at a point just beyond the opening of the left exit lane for traffic travelling to Bargo. The skid marks would suggest that the appellant first reacted to the imminent risk of collision when considerably less than 50m from the rear of the respondent’s vehicle. The respondent’s vehicle was displaying a large reflective sign, which should have been visible to the appellant at a distance of around 100m. There would not be a basis for drawing an inference as a matter of probability that had the hazard lights on the dog trailer or a flashing emergency light been activated the appellant would have taken action in sufficient time to avoid colliding with the respondent’s vehicle.  
     
      
    105 For these reasons I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The appeal is dismissed; 
        
       
       
        
        2. The appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 18 February 2008 Mark Anthony Collon pleaded guilty to a charge that on 27 October 2006 he murdered Daryl Ogden. 
     
      
    2 The background of the matter is as follows: In October 2006 the offender, who was then 21 years old, shared a home unit in Redfern with the deceased, then aged 24. The unit was owned by the Department of Housing and subcontracted to the South Sydney Youth Service. The offender had lived there since late 2005, through the services of an organisation called Open Family Australia, which provides assistance and accommodation to homeless people. The deceased moved into the unit in August 2006. The two of them did not get on well together. They had a number of differences, mainly about domestic matters. Both of them told officers from Open Family Australia that they did not want to continue staying in the unit. Various attempts were made to resolve the issues between them. Meetings were arranged for 25 and 26 October 2006. The deceased attended these appointments but the offender failed to attend. The deceased was apparently apprehensive about the offender’s behaviour. He told a friend that he placed his bar fridge across his bedroom at night so that the offender could not come in. 
     
      
    3 On the morning of 27 October 2006 a third meeting was scheduled between the offender and the deceased. Yet again the deceased arrived at the meeting but the offender failed to attend. Later that day the offender was telephoned and told that his non-attendance meant that he might be asked to leave the unit. That evening, between 7.00 and 7.30, the occupant of a neighbouring unit heard yelling. At 7.26 that evening the offender made a 000 call to ambulance emergency. He said “I just stabbed a guy, man.” A little later the operator asked if the patient was conscious, he said “I fucking killed him.” Later when asked to put pressure on the patient’s bleeding he said “I can’t, I slit his throat. I stabbed him first.” 
     
      
    4 The tape of these calls was played in court during the sentencing proceedings. They showed that the offender was extremely stressed at the time and on the verge of panicking. Indeed the telephone operator had to get him to moderate his rapid breathing. During the course of the call the ambulance officers arrived at the premises. The offender sent them upstairs saying “I’ve stabbed him, he’s dead.” 
     
      
    5 The police arrived very shortly afterwards. At that time the offender was seated at the entrance to the block of units, rocking backwards and forwards, covered in blood, with tears running down his face. He was making a humming noise. He told the police that he had started sniffing butane at about 9.00 or 10.00 that morning and had been drinking wine from 2.00 pm. He said “Daryl came home about 7.30pm and we had a fight. Daryl had stolen a pack of my cigarettes and damaged my bedroom door. Daryl also accused me of taking his play station too. I went into the kitchen and grabbed a long carving knife and then I stabbed him in the eye then cut his throat.” 
     
      
    6 The offender was taken to Redfern Police Station where an ERISP was conducted later that night. The offender told police that he and the deceased had an argument which degenerated into a fight. He, the offender, was the first to throw a punch. After a short time he, the offender, went into the kitchen, took a long carving knife and went back into the deceased’s bedroom where he stabbed him “in a few places”, he was not sure precisely where. Police later went to the unit where they found two knives in the kitchen sink, a large one and a smaller one. The larger knife had obvious signs of blood on the blade. A pair of scissors was found in the deceased’s bedroom with blood on both blades. All three items tested positive for blood which had the same DNA profile as that of the deceased.  
     
      
    7 A post mortem examination was conducted on the deceased by Dr Paul Morrow. The significant wounds included:· A stab wound to the right side of the neck that passed downwards through the structures of the side of the neck.· A stab wound to the left side of the back that entered the left pleural cavity and the upper lobe of the left lung.· A large incised wound that passed across the neck. · In addition there were 15 superficial wounds to the head and neck, at least 4 wounds to the hands and 8 relatively superficial wounds to the deceased’s back. 
     
      
    8 I turn now to discuss the offender’s personal background. This comes from several psychiatric and psychological reports, but principally from the report of Dr Rosalie Wilcox, forensic psychiatrist, dated 17 December 2007. 
     
      
    9 The offender is 22 years old, having been born on 16 September 1985. The offender had an extremely disturbed and disrupted childhood. When he was 3 or 4 years old his mother left the family home leaving the offender and his older brother in their father’s care. For the next two years or so the offender lived with his paternal grandparents. Then his father remarried and he and his brother returned to live with their father and step-mother. It is apparent that the offender suffered a great deal of physical and mental abuse at the hands of both his father and his step-mother. The first official notification of child abuse occurred in 1992 when he was 7 years old. Many more followed. At the age of 10 the offender was placed into Glenfield Park Special School for children with behavioural problems and learning difficulties. At about that time he was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder and placed on medication. When he was 12 years old his father, saying that he was unable to control him, handed him over to the care of DOCS and he was made a State ward. He has had minimal contact with his father since then. He was put into various placements but foster care was always unsuccessful, with the offender generally running away after a relatively short time. He spent a great deal of time on the streets, saying that he preferred this type of existence. 
     
      
    10 Starting at about the age of 12 the offender has been a consistent substance abuser. He has regularly sniffed significant quantities of butane and has been a binge drinker. He has also been a marijuana user, which he described as his drug of choice. However his principal drug has been butane, because it was cheap and easily available. The offender’s schooling was extremely disrupted. He had no secondary schooling and has acquired no further skills since then. 
     
      
    11 The offender has an extremely long criminal history. The material before me does not reveal the full extent of his various attendances before the Children’s Court. However the documents do indicate the following offences. As early as August 1998, when he was not yet 13, he was charged with assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty, and malicious damage to property. In February of the following year he committed several assaults. At that time he was approximately thirteen and a half years old. He was described as already having a “lengthy criminal history.” Very significantly, there have been two previous incidents in which he has threatened to use a knife: once in March 1999 and again in May 2003 when he was placed under a Control Order for 12 months in relation to two charges of robbery being armed with an offensive weapon, namely a knife.  
     
      
    12 Dr Wilcox had access to documentation from Juvenile Justice. She noted that there were 98 pages that related to the offender’s prior contact with the police. There were multiple reports of the offender’s poor impulse control and both threats and acts of violence. 
     
      
    13 Dr Wilcox did not consider that the offender continued to suffer from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. She noted that it was generally a condition of childhood or adolescence. She diagnosed him as primarily suffering from poly-substance abuse/dependence. She said “I believe his poor impulse control; difficulty controlling his temper and his aggressive outburst can be explained on the basis of his impaired personality with the progression of his conduct disorder of childhood to an Anti-social Personality Disorder.” 
     
      
    14 As to the offender’s state of mind at the time of this offence, Dr Wilcox considered that his capacity to control his actions was impaired by an abnormality of mind. That abnormality in turn arose from a combination of his anti-social personality disorder, his substance abuse and his borderline mild intellectual disability. 
     
      
    15 The offender professed to have no memory of the killing itself. Dr Wilcox did not consider that he suffered an alcoholic blackout at the time. Either he was dissembling about this matter or he had deliberately tried to erase the matter from his memory.  
     
      
    16 Dr Jonathon Carne, forensic psychiatrist, assessed the offender at Long Bay Gaol on 22 August 2007. In his report dated 24 August 2007 he expressed the view that the offender suffered from a number of psychiatric disorders. These included Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and mild intellectual disability characterised by, amongst other things, poor organisation, increased impulsivity and significant poly-drug abuse problem. At the time of the offence he considered that the offender’s mental functioning was further impaired by acute intoxication. In a subsequent report dated 18 February 2008, after reviewing more documentation about the case, Dr Carne expressed the view that the offender was not suffering from a psychopathic personality disorder. He set out a recommended treatment plan for him, the first step being that he abstain from all recreational drugs. 
     
      
    17 Counsel for the Crown and the offender both provided detailed written submissions. The following aggravating factors in relation to the offence, as opposed to the offender, were relied upon by the Crown and not disputed by Mr Winch, who appeared for the offender. 
     
      
       
      First that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon and secondly that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. 
       
      
    18 I regard the first of these factors as by far the most significant. Not only did the offence involve the use of one weapon, but the forensic evidence clearly shows that two separate knives and a pair of scissors must have been wielded by the offender against the deceased. The number and extent of the injuries revealed in the autopsy report bear testament to the ferocity of this attack. Because of this factor, the Crown has submitted that this offence falls well above the mid-range of objective seriousness for the offence of murder. 
     
      
    19 I accept that the ferocity and violence of the attack upon the deceased is a serious aggravating factor, as is the fact that no less than three weapons were used. On the other hand, the killing itself was neither planned nor premeditated. There was a background of friction between the two men, but the evidence reveals no previous serious violence between them. The sequence of events which all parties accept as the most likely is this: After the deceased arrived home on the evening of 27th, the offender took a knife intending to threaten him with it. At some point in the confrontation between them, the offender lost control of himself and launched into his ferocious attack on the deceased. He nevertheless had enough self-awareness, and consciousness of the horror of the consequences of his actions, to make the 000 call shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    20 Given the lack of planning involved, I do not consider that the objective seriousness of this offence is as high as the Crown would put it. In my view it is in the mid-range of seriousness for the offence of murder. 
     
      
    21 I turn to consider the aggravating or mitigating factors relating to the offender himself. The most important of the potential aggravating factors is the offender’s long record of prior convictions, some of them involving offences of violence. However all of these were committed when the offender was still subject to the jurisdiction of the Children’s Court. He has no serious convictions at all as an adult. Mr Winch submits that in these circumstances his criminal history is insufficient to raise considerations of retribution, deterrence or protection of society. The Crown submits that issues of specific deterrence need to be taken into account on sentence. 
     
      
    22 It is very difficult to take account of matters such as specific deterrence or danger to the public in relation to an offender who is going to spend a very long time in custody, given the nature of the offence he has committed. 
     
      
    23 The offender is still only 22 years old. By the time he is eligible for parole he will be in his mid to late thirties. It is appears that his pattern of offending has been closely linked to his substance abuse. It certainly was on this occasion. When he becomes intoxicated, he loses his already–impaired ability to control his impulses. Therefore, it seems to me, his rehabilitation is likely to be strongly linked with whether he can be freed of his alcohol and drug dependence.  
     
      
    24 It follows from all this that although the offender’s prior record is clearly a material factor, I do not propose to use it as a substantial aggravating factor in relation to the sentence I am about to impose. It is certainly relevant to the issue of special circumstances. 
     
      
    25 As to mitigating factors, Mr Winch submits that the offender has shown remorse, through his 000 call, his plea of guilty and also through evidence which he gave in the sentencing proceedings when he expressed his feelings of guilt for his actions. I accept that there is a degree of remorse and I take that into account. Much more significant is the offender’s plea of guilty. Submissions have been made by both parties as to the timing of this plea, whether it was made at a reasonably early opportunity and the extent of its utilitarian value. I do not propose to go through these in detail. In realistic terms, the plea was made fairly late in the day. In my view a discount of 15% is appropriate.  
     
      
    26 The youth of the offender is a further significant matter to be taken into account. Although this offence is a gravely serious one – the most serious offence in the criminal calendar – rehabilitation is still a very important consideration in relation to a person of his age. In this regard, I repeat my belief that, if the offender can be cured of his alcohol and drug dependence, there is a real chance that he will not re-offend in any serious way. The offender has, as Dr Carne pointed out, suffered a lifetime of physical and emotional abuse, inconsistent and erratic parenting and role models, and alienation from mainstream society. These factors contributed, in Dr Carne’s opinion, to the offender’s behaviour and state of mind at the time of this offence. 
     
      
    27 All of this is, in my view, highly relevant on sentencing, particularly given the youth of the offender. If the offender receives appropriate counselling and educational programmes, initially in a custodial setting and later in the community, he might have a real chance, despite his dysfunctional background, of becoming a functioning member of the community. 
     
      
    28 A very moving Victim Impact Statement was read in court on behalf of the deceased’s mother Debbie Ogden. The court expresses its condolences to the deceased’s family. I take the Impact Statement into account in the manner provided in the legislation. 
     
      
    29 The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. The standard non-parole period is imprisonment for 20 years. However this has no direct application in relation to an offender who has pleaded guilty. Rather it is to be used as a guide in assessing the sentence which is appropriate to all the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    30 I have no difficulty in finding that special circumstances exist in this case given the offender’s highly deprived and dysfunctional upbringing and his need for long term assistance in order to enable him to integrate effectively into the community – particularly in relation to his alcohol and drug dependence. However the length of the overall sentence I must impose means that the offender will already have a significant period on parole, even under the statutory proportions. Therefore, the adjustment on account of special circumstances will be a relatively minor one.31 The offender has been in custody since 27 October 2006 and his sentence is to commence on that date.  
     
      
    32 Mark Anthony Collon for the murder of Daryl Ogden, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 14 years and 6 months commencing on 27 October 2006 and expiring on 26 April 2021.  
     
      
      The balance of your term of imprisonment will be 6 years and 6 months commencing on 27 April 2021 and expiring on 26 October 2027. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 26 April 2021.

      2007/2709 R v Maumaga LEIATAUA 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 29 January 2008 Maumaga Leiataua pleaded guilty, on Indictment, to the following two charges: 
     
      
       
      First: that on 11 March 2007 he murdered Sharna De-Courcey. 
       
      Second: that on the same date he threatened injury to Fou Tuavao with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  
      
    2 In addition, an offence under Form 1 is to be taken into account when sentencing the offender on the murder charge. That offence is that on the 11 March he broke and entered the dwelling house of Sharna De-Courcey with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely malicious wounding, in circumstances of aggravation, namely that he was armed with an offensive weapon being a 20 centimetres long knife. 
     
      
    3 The background of the matter is as follows. The offender is a 41 year old Samoan who arrived in Australia from New Zealand in 2006. He had been married with two young children but was separated from his family well before the events in question. 
     
      
    4 In about September 2006 the offender entered into a relationship with the deceased Sharna De-Courcey who was then 20 years old. She also had two very young children. They terminated their relationship by mutual consent in January 2007. The offender at that time was living at Tregear, a western suburb of Sydney, with his brother, Joseph and his sister-in-law, Sina. The deceased was living in Whalan, about 15 minutes walk away. Immediately opposite the deceased’s home was the home of Sina’s sister, Fou Tuavao, who is the victim in relation to the second count in the Indictment. 
     
      
    5 On the evening of Saturday 10 March 2007 the offender, together with his brother and sister-in-law, were at a friend’s home where they consumed a considerable amount of alcohol. At about one in the morning the offender, together with his sister-in-law, Sina, went to the home of Sina’s sister, Ms Tuavao where the three of them continued to drink beer and spirits. 
     
      
    6 In the meantime the deceased had been out for the night with friends. She arrived home by taxi between four and five in the morning, accompanied by a male companion. By coincidence, the offender had, not long before, ordered a taxi to take him and his sister-in-law home. Thinking that this taxi was for him, he went outside and saw the deceased with her companion. He confronted them, at first with verbal abuse, but later physically taking hold of the deceased and shaking her. His sister-in-law intervened and pulled him away. The deceased and her companion then went into her home. The offender and his sister-in-law returned to Ms Tuavao’s home, opposite, where the offender consumed more alcohol.  
     
      
    7 Not long afterwards the offender and his sister-in-law left Ms Tuavao’s house and walked back to their home in Tregear. His sister-in-law went to bed. The offender collected a hammer and a knife from the laundry, put them in a backpack and jogged back to the deceased’s home. By this time it was about 6.30 in the morning. 
     
      
    8 Once at the deceased’s home, the offender collected a set of green plastic outdoor chairs and stacked them underneath the deceased’s bedroom window. He then used them to climb up to the window. He smashed the glass in the window, cutting himself in the process, and climbed into the bedroom. The deceased was alone there, as her companion had gone to the bathroom. The offender then proceeded to stab the deceased in the stomach. It was a very serious wound, exposing her intestines. He put the deceased in a headlock and pulled her towards the front door. At this stage her companion came out and saw them. Both the offender and the deceased were covered in blood. The offender was wielding the knife, so the companion did not try to intervene. Instead he ran outside to alert the neighbours.  
     
      
    9 At about this time the deceased managed to extricate herself from the offender. She ran across the road to Ms Tuavao’s house and banged on the side door. Ms Tuavao came out and saw the deceased covered in blood. She took the deceased by her arms and tried to pull her inside the house. However the offender, who had followed the deceased, grabbed her by the hair and pulled her backwards. The deceased tried to grab hold of the edges of the door frame but she fell to the ground, lying on her back with her head towards the offender. While she was in that position the offender stabbed her numerous times in the chest and stomach. Ms Tuavao was trying to pull the deceased by her legs into the home, and at one point the offender lunged towards her with the knife saying: “If you don’t move away and leave her I’ll kill you” or words to that effect. This constitutes the second offence charged in the indictment. 
     
      
    10 Not surprisingly Ms Tuavao did move away. The offender continued to stab the deceased in the area of her heart, moving the blade of the knife around and around. Ms Tuavao’s two children, aged 3 and 13, were standing nearby watching the incident. 
     
      
    11 The offender in due course ceased his attack on the deceased. He went back over the road to her home where he washed the blood off his hands. He then walked backwards and forwards in the street, apparently mumbling to himself. 
     
      
    12 A number of people had telephoned 000. The police arrived shortly afterwards and arrested the offender. In a subsequent ERISP he admitted breaking into the deceased’s home and stabbing her. He said that he was drunk and very angry with the deceased at the time. He was then charged with murder and has been in custody ever since. 
     
      
    13 I apologise to the deceased’s family, who are present, for this recitation of the deceased’s injuries which I know they will find very distressing. However it is necessary to catalogue these injuries, for the sheer brutality of this killing is a highly relevant matter on sentence.  
     
      
    14 The post mortem report of Dr Dianne Little attests to the ferocity of the attack upon the deceased. There were no less than sixty injuries on the deceased’s body. Around the head and neck there were sixteen injuries, consisting of eleven bruises and abrasions, one puncture wound and four stab wounds. The stab wounds varied in depth between 1.5 and 5 centimetres. There were sixteen further injuries to the deceased’s trunk. These comprised six areas of abrasions, three incised wounds and seven stab wounds. The stab wounds varied from 4 centimetres to 28 centimetres in depth. One of them, in the deceased’s upper chest, passed completely through her body and exited through her back. The remaining 28 injuries were inflicted on the deceased’s arms and legs. There were seven areas of abrasions, ten incised wounds, and eleven stab wounds, four of which were exit wounds.  
     
      
    15 I turn now to say something about the offender himself. The offender is 41 years old having been born in Western Samoa on 8 August 1966. He comes from a very large family: he was the second youngest of thirteen children. On all accounts it was a very difficult childhood. His family was very poor; his father was frequently intoxicated and regularly abused his children, including the offender. He completed his schooling in year ten when he was 17 years old. He had some learning difficulties and was not a good student. His results were generally below average. Since leaving school he has obtained no further qualifications or skills. In spite of this he has been able to remain in full time employment for most of his adult life. 
     
      
    16 At the age of 19 the offender moved to New Zealand. There he worked as a machine operator for a number of years. In June 1994 he was convicted, following a jury trial, of raping a female over the age of 16. He was sentenced to imprisonment for five years. He was released from custody after three years.  
     
      
    17 The offender married in the early to mid 1990s, when he was about 27 years old. There are two children from the marriage. In January 2000 the offender was convicted of assaulting a female, apparently his wife. He told Mr. Taylor, the psychologist, that he had punched his wife because she mistreated his children. The marriage finally ended in 2001 when the offender’s wife left New Zealand and brought the two children to Australia. The offender was unable to come at that time because he was not a New Zealand citizen. He eventually came to Australia in September 2006, hoping to reunite with his family. However on his arrival his wife told him that she had formed a new relationship. This on all accounts was extremely upsetting to the offender.18 The offender has a long history of alcohol abuse. He started drinking heavily when he was in New Zealand, and on all accounts, intoxication had a large part to play in the rape offence for which he was sentenced in 1994. He told Mr Taylor that after his separation from his wife he drank to the point of intoxication almost every day. He maintained this pattern of drinking until he went into custody. It is perfectly clear that alcohol played a very large part in the commission of these offences. This is neither a mitigating nor an aggravating factor, but it probably serves to explain at least part of the offender’s extraordinary behaviour that morning. 
     
      
    19 I come now to discuss the matters relevant to sentence. I am dealing here with the primary offence of murder. I shall discuss the second charge on the indictment a little later. 
     
      
    20 My first task is to assess the objective seriousness of the offence, taking into account matters set out in s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 insofar as they relate to the offence itself rather than to the offender. 
     
      
    21 The Crown submits that the following aggravating factors in s 21A are relevant to his case: 
     
      
       
      1. The offence involved the actual use of a weapon. 
       
      2. The offence was committed in the home of the victim. 
       
      3. The offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years of age. 
       
      4. The offence was part of a planned activity. 
      
    22 Mr Smith of counsel, who appeared for the offender on sentence, did not dispute the first two matters, which are clearly applicable in this case. However in relation to the third matter, namely that the offence was committed in the presence of a child, Mr Smith submitted that this can only be relevant if the offender actually knew of the presence of the child. There was no evidence to that effect in this case, he submitted.23 It is the presence of Ms Tuavao’s children at the scene which gives rise to this issue. It would seem that her three year old daughter and thirteen year old son both witnessed the offender’s brutal stabbing of the deceased at the doorway of their home. The offender was related to Mrs Tuavao, by marriage, and he would have been well aware of the likely presence of the children within the home at that time of day. Certainly he did not choose the location of this final attack on his victim. It was she who ran to Ms Tuavao’s home in an unsuccessful endeavour to find refuge. In continuing his attack upon her at that home the offender should, in my view, have been aware,at the very least, of the real possibility that one or more or Ms Tuavao’s children would witness the attack. In my view this is a relevant aggravating factor. 
     
      
    24 The other matter disputed by Mr Smith related to the degree of planning before the offence. The intention to kill or really seriously injure the victim, he submitted, was only formed after the offender had gained entry to the victim’s house. In other words, the offender should have the benefit of the mitigating factor that the offence was not part of a planned or organised activity. I cannot accede to this submission. The fact that the offender collected a hammer and knife from his own home and took them back to the deceased’s home is crucial to this issue. One must ask what was the offender’s intention at that time if it was not to inflict injury, and probably very serious injury, having regard to the nature of the knife. The Crown does not suggest that the offender had an intention to kill the victim when he broke into her home, rather that he intended at that time to really seriously injure her. It was only when he was inside and the situation escalated that he formed an intention to kill her. 
     
      
    25 I accept this analysis. In my view the act of collecting the knife from the offender’s home and taking it back to the deceased’s home clearly shows a degree of planning and premeditation; certainly not to kill the deceased at that stage, but to inflict really serious injury upon her. This is consistent with the offence set out on Form 1, namely that the offender broke into the deceased’s home intending to commit a serious indictable offence, to wit, malicious wounding. Mr Smith submitted that the “malicious wounding” referred to in this offence falls short of inflicting grievous bodily harm. However I reject this submission: it is not consistent with the terms of s 33 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    26 I therefore accept that each of the four aggravating factors referred to in s 21A and relied upon by the Crown are applicable in this case. There are no relevant mitigating factors. 
     
      
    27 Thus far, I have mentioned only the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A. In my view, by far the most significant aggravating factor in relation to this offence arises apart from that section. I am referring to the ferocity and brutality of the killing itself. As the Crown Prosecutor said, it is difficult to imagine the horror that the deceased must have suffered during this attack. When she was already gravely injured, with the stab wound to her stomach, she managed to escape and to seek refuge in Ms Tuavao’s house opposite. Refuge was close to her, but the offender chased her, pulled her out of Ms Tuavao’s grasp and then proceeded with a frenzied attack which inflicted terrible injuries. 
     
      
    28 All these factors combine, in my opinion to place the objective seriousness of this offence above the mid-range and well above it. 
     
      
    29 I turn now to consider the aggravating and/or mitigating factors relating to the offender himself.  
     
      
    30 By way of aggravation, the Crown relies on the offender’s criminal record. This consists of the two New Zealand convictions I have already mentioned, namely the rape conviction in 1994 and the assault female in 2000. Mr. Smith acknowledges these offences, but submits that they are not such as should be treated as aggravating factors in the present case. He contrasts the offender’s record with the lengthy records which one so often sees in these courts, and points out that the one really serious offence, the rape, was committed a long time ago now. The offender has no convictions at all in this country. 
     
      
    31 I am inclined to accept this submission. The offender’s convictions deprive him of the benefit of a number of mitigating factors which he would otherwise have been able to call upon under s 21A. Given the matters referred to by Mr. Smith, I consider that it would be unduly harsh to him to also use his record as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    32 Given this finding, it is strictly not necessary to refer to the considerations of personal deterrence or danger to the public. In my view they would not in any event be significant considerations in the case of the offender. Mr. Taylor assessed him as having a low to moderate risk of recidivism. It must be remembered that by the time he is released from custody he will be approaching his sixties. There is nothing in his background to suggest that these considerations should have any real relevance to his situation at that stage.33 There are two mitigating factors: the offender’s remorse, and his plea of guilty. I accept that he is extremely remorseful for his actions. A handwritten letter from the offender was tendered on sentence, expressing profound regret for what he has done. The contrition is also expressed in his plea of guilty. Mr. Smith submitted, and the Crown agreed, that the plea of guilty should, in the circumstances, result in a 20% reduction of sentence in his case. I agree that this is an appropriate deduction, and I propose to apply it. 
     
      
    34 Victim Impact Statements were read to the Court on behalf of the deceased’s mother, Julie Helm, and her grandmother, Pat de Courcey. These attest to the vibrant, outgoing and giving nature of the deceased, and the devastating effect of her death on everyone who knew her, particularly on her family and her two very young children, Angel and Wilson. The Court acknowledges these extremely moving statements, and expresses its condolences to the deceased’s family, who have closely followed these proceedings. I take the statements into account in the manner provided by the legislation. 
     
      
    35 The standard non-parole period for murder is 20 years. However the offender’s plea of guilty means that it does not directly apply in this case. Rather, it is to be used as a guide in determining the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    36 In sentencing the offender for murder I am also obliged to take into account the Form 1 offence. The Crown submits that I should increase the sentence, albeit only slightly, to take account of this offence. However the breaking into the deceased’s home was so much a feature of the principal offence – and, in one sense, indeed was one of the aggravating factors in relation to it – that it would be inappropriate, in my view, to also take account of it under this head.  
     
      
    37 Thus far I have discussed only the principal offence of murder. I now turn to discuss, albeit briefly, the second count to which the offender has pleaded guilty. That is the offence of threatening injury to Ms Tuavao with intent to wound her and cause grievous bodily harm. It was a serious offence, which placed Ms Tuavao at personal risk of injury, and which terrified both her and the two children who witnessed it. In this regard, there are two aggravating factors under s 21A: first, that it involved the threatened use of an offensive weapon; secondly that it was committed in the presence of a child – or in this case, two children – under the age of 18. Ms Tuavao’s Victim Impact Statement testifies to the lasting effect that this offence has had on all three of them, all of whom continue to suffer from recurring nightmares. The sole mitigating factor is that it was not part of a planned or organised activity. 
     
      
    38 The Crown has submitted that the sentence for this offence should be partially cumulative on the sentence for murder. I think that this is appropriate in the circumstances. In one sense this offence was part of the offender’s continuing attack on the deceased, and was therefore related to the murder. However, unlike the Form 1 offence, this offence involved a separate victim and, in my view, requires a degree of separate punishment. However, given the length of the term that the offender will be serving in relation to the murder, the principle of totality requires that there be a much smaller degree of accumulation than would otherwise be appropriate for this offence 
     
      
    39 Affidavits by family members of the offender have been tendered, testifying to their continued support for him. I very much hope that this support continues for the long time that the offender will remain in custody. 
     
      
    40 Mr. Smith submitted that there are special circumstances in this case which should break the statutory nexus between the non-parole period and the balance of the term. In particular, the offender will benefit from a long period of supervision on his release from custody. On the other hand, as Mr. Smith himself observed, the non-parole period provided in the legislation is generally sufficient to allow for adequate supervision in the case of many homicide offenders. In many ways, I consider that this is such a case. However, because of the central importance of rehabilitation in the offender’s case, and because he will almost certainly need a great deal of support and assistance on his release from custody, I have tempered the sentence I would otherwise have imposed, by very slightly reducing the non-parole period, and correspondingly increasing the additional term. To this extent, I find that the offender’s likely need for lengthy ongoing support and assistance constitutes special circumstances. 
     
      
    41 The offender has been in custody since 11 March 2007, and his sentences must therefore commence on that date. 
     
      
    42 Maumaga Leiataua, in relation to the offence of threatening injury to Fou Tuavao with intent to commit an indictable offence, I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years, to commence on 11 March 2007 and to expire on 10 March 2009. In relation to the murder of Sharna De-Courcey, and taking into account the offence on Form 1, I sentence you to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 17 years, to commence on 11 September 2007 and to expire on 10 September 2024. The balance of your term of imprisonment will be 6 years and six months, commencing on 11 September 2024 and expiring on 10 March 2031 The first date on which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 10 September 2024.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant pleaded not guilty to a charge of persistent sexual abuse of a child contrary to s 66EA of the Crimes Act 1900. He was tried in the District Court and convicted. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7½ years imprisonment with a further term of 2½ years. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 25 years. 
     
      
    2 The indictment read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 1 January 2001 and 8 June 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales on three or more separate occasions occurring on separate days did engage in conduct in relation to [the complainant], a child under the age of 18 years, that constituted a sexual offence, namely: 
        
       
       
        
        Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002 at Dee Why, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], she being a child under the age of 10 years; 
        
       
       
        
        Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002 at Dee Why, did assault [the complainant], and at the time of the assault, did commit an act of indecency upon [the complainant], she being a child under the age of 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Between 29 April 2003 and 8 June 2004 at Hornsby, did attempt to have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, she being a child under the age of 16 years. 
        
       
       
        
        Between 1 January 2004 and 8 June 2004 at Hornsby, did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant], she being a child then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 14 years, in circumstances of aggravation, namely, she being under the authority of Mark Langbein.” 
        
       
      
    3 The appellant appeals his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 The complainant was born on 22 February 1993. She was the child of AS and SL who had divorced in 1997. The father remarried BS. The mother remarried the appellant. 
     
      
    5 After the complainant’s parents separated her mother had custody of her and her younger sister. The father had access to them pursuant to orders made in the Family Court. 
     
      
    6 After his remarriage the complainant’s father went to live with his new wife in the Hunter Valley. He was initially employed in the Navy but after a period of unemployment found employment with the Department of Corrective Services. 
     
      
    7 By agreement between the parents the children came to visit their father for a period between January and April 2003. 
     
      
    8 The complainant’s mother had problems with drugs. There was a dispute about whether she was properly caring for the children and on 8 June 2004 the father was contacted by police who informed him that his former wife had harmed herself and was in hospital. AS travelled to the school that the girls attended at Hornsby and took custody of them. He subsequently commenced proceedings in the Family Court and was granted interim custody of the children in July 2004. 
     
      
    9 After coming into the custody of their father the complainant and her sister were enrolled at a local public school. On 1 September 2004 the complainant participated in a child protection class dealing with sexual abuse which was conducted by her teacher. During the course of the lesson the teacher told the children that people who commit sexual abuse are not always strangers but could be a family member. 
     
      
    10 During the lesson the complainant raised her hand and asked the teacher who one would tell if they had been sexually abused. After some discussion the teacher said that you would definitely tell the teacher. Towards the end of the class the complainant approached the teacher and said she wished to tell her something. 
     
      
    11 The complainant spoke with the teacher and told her that she had been sexually abused. The teacher asked whether it had happened where she was now living. The complainant replied that it had occurred at her mother’s place. The teacher asked her if she could tell her father and the complainant said she did not think she could. However, the complainant said that she thought she could tell her step-mother. 
     
      
    12 The complainant’s step-mother, BS, gave evidence that when she picked the children up from school that afternoon the complainant approached her and told her that she had something very private and personal to tell her. After they had arrived home the complainant said to BS: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have got something to tell you. I have been sexually abused.” 
        
       
      
    13 The complainant told BS that the appellant was responsible for the abuse and the complainant gave some limited details of the events which she alleged had occurred. 
     
      
    14 The complainant was subsequently interviewed on 3 separate occasions by the police. The interviews were video taped and edited versions of the tapes were played to the jury as her evidence in chief. Transcripts of the interviews were provided to the jury. During these interviews 4 occasions of alleged abuse were identified by reference to the first time, second time, the worst time and the last time. 
     
      
    15 The first occasion was alleged to have been when the complainant was living at Dee Why. This was in 1999 or 2000 when the complainant was aged either 6 or 7. She alleged that the appellant had picked her up from school and taken her home. She said that her sister was asleep and the appellant had told her to go into the bedroom and take off her pants and underpants. The appellant undressed and had an erection. She alleged that they both lay on the bed and the appellant put his finger into her vagina. During the episode the complainant had said that she had kept a pillow over her face because she did not like to look. Afterwards the appellant told her not to tell anyone. 
     
      
    16 In relation to the second occasion the complainant alleged that some 2 or 3 weeks after the first occasion the appellant had again picked her up from school. Her sister was at a friend’s house. She alleged that the appellant had again directed her to go to the bedroom and remove her clothes. He removed his clothes. They lay on the bed and she alleged that the appellant rubbed his finger on the outside of her vagina. After this stopped she said she felt the appellant’s mouth and tongue on her vagina. 
     
      
    17 The complainant said that the third occasion took place towards the end of 2003 or early 2004 when she was living in Hornsby. It was a weekend and her mother and sister had gone shopping so that she was alone with the appellant. He allegedly told her to go into the bedroom where he joined her and took off his clothes. He then took off her clothes and told her to lie on the bed. She said that she felt the appellant put his mouth on her vagina and subsequently attempt on a number of occasions to place his penis inside her vagina but he was unable to do so. She said that the appellant told her not to tell anyone or he would hurt her family. He said it was “their little secret.” 
     
      
    18 She alleged that the fourth occasion was about a month before she had gone to live with her father. This would have placed it in May 2004. She said that they had been to the Westfield shopping complex in Hornsby on a weekend where they had shopped and eaten lunch. Her mother had gone to work and her sister was at a friend’s house. They returned home together. She alleged that the appellant asked her to go to the bedroom where he told her to undress. He removed his own clothes and they lay on the bed together. She said that he put his mouth and tongue on her vagina and then placed two fingers inside it. She alleged that on this occasion the appellant again threatened to hurt her family if she told anyone. 
     
      
    19 Although other witnesses were called in the Crown case, including the complainant’s parents, her step mother and the school teacher there was no independent support for the complainant’s evidence. 
     
      
    20 The appellant gave evidence in which he strenuously denied any sexual misconduct. 
     
      
    21 The complainant admitted in cross-examination that she had become disturbed and frightened by her mother’s drug taking and that she was also frightened of the appellant. She admitted that she had wished to live with her father and did not want to return to live with her mother and the appellant. She agreed that she had not told anyone before telling the teacher about these events. The defence argued that in the context of an acrimonious custody dispute the complainant had fabricated the allegations in order that she could remain living with her father. It was suggested that she had done this either on her own or at the behest of her father. 
     
      
       
      Appeal against conviction 
       
      
    22 The Notice of Appeal contained six grounds. Ground 5 is not pressed. Each of the other grounds complains of some aspect of the trial judge’s directions to the jury. 
     
      
       
      Ground One – the summing up lacked balance, objectivity and was unfair thereby causing a miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    23 The essential obligations of a trial judge when summing up to a jury have been discussed on many occasions. Care is necessary because of the need to ensure that both the prosecution and defence case are fairly placed before the jury in a balanced and impartial manner. The summing up should be detached and dispassionate in its treatment of the defence case. The trial judge should be mindful of the power which his or her observations have in the context of the trial and their likely impact upon the jury. Care must be taken lest the jury be overawed by the judge and fail to gain a proper understanding of the defence case and matters relevant to it. 
     
      
    24 Relevant principles are discussed in R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 per Wood CJ at CL at [86]; R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7 at [208]; R v Banic [2004] NSWCCA 322 at [21]-[22]; R v Machin (1996) 68 SASR 526; R v Courtney-Smith No 2 (1990) 48 A Crim R 49; B v The Queen (1992) 175 CLR 599; R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 106-107. The principles relating to the requirement for a fair and balanced summing-up were discussed in the following recent decisions of this Court: Picken v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [96]-[103]; Robinson v R [2006] NSWCCA 192 at [140]; Gardiner v R [2006] 162 A Crim R 233 at [103]-[104]; Regina v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54 at [88]-[96]. 
     
      
    25 The trial judge commenced summing up on Wednesday 18 October 2006. His Honour recited the charge and gave the usual explanation as to the role of the judge and the jury. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your function however is to determine all matters of fact. The facts are for you and for you alone to determine and if you discern or even think that you discern that I have taken a view on the facts then you must disregard that view unless it accords with your own view independently formed.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is for you to determine if a witness saw or heard or felt or did that which he or she said he or she saw or heard or felt or did. It is for you to determine if a witness is accurately reporting that which he or she saw or heard or felt or did and it is for you to determine if a witness is telling the truth in part or in whole.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour continued and explained to the jury that they could accept a witness in whole or in part, assess their evidence against other pieces of evidence and told the jury: “you should look to see if what a witness says accords with your own understanding of the ways of the world.” His Honour then said that the jury should look to the demeanour of the witness. 
     
      
    27 Following these general observations his Honour gave the jury directions in relation to the evidence of a child. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “With a child making such allegations as have been made in this case you should look to see first of all whether there are details such as a child might recollect being now recounted. You should look also to see whether there are, in her evidence, matters which are likely to be a contribution from an adult rather than from her, that is that they are words or expressions or ideas which she could not, having regard to her age, generate herself but which are in fact generated for her, that is that they are not within the scope of a child’s imagination. For instance you could look to such matters as the expression ‘this won’t hurt’ or ‘I’m teaching you about these things’ or ‘this is our little secret’ or ‘how far fingers had gone into her vagina or that she was merely big enough.’ If you hear in those an adult voice rather than a child’s voice you may draw more support in relation to her evidence.” 
        
       
      
    28 It was submitted that these comments by his Honour had the effect of unfairly bolstering her evidence. The submission emphasised the fact that when referring to expressions which might be used by an adult his Honour referred to expressions actually used by the complainant in her evidence. This was said to have the effect of bolstering her credibility. It was submitted that his Honour should have used examples which were not found in the evidence given at the trial. 
     
      
    29 The appellant’s counsel also submitted that the trial judge had commented upon the appellant’s evidence in a manner which diminished its significance. This problem was alleged to exist in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
        “By the same token, looking to the accused’s evidence you will recall that he became very emphatic when being cross-examined by the Crown but undue weight should not, I submit to you, be given to this. This is a very serious matter and one where the outcome is very important to an accused person who perhaps can say little more than after that lapse of time all that I can say is that it did not occur.” 
        
       
      
    30 The appellant submitted that the individual directions reveal a lack of appropriate balance but, more significantly, when accumulated with other matters to which I shall refer the entire summing up lacks the objectivity and balance which the law requires. In relation to the directions to which I have already referred I do not accept that the complaint is justified. By referring to the evidence his Honour gave substance to his direction that the jury should pay careful regard to the expressions used by the complainant. It would have been difficult if not impossible to provide the jury with meaningful directions unless reference was made to the evidence. It is, of course, true that the direction did have the consequence that the jury would be able to identify aspects of the complainant’s evidence which reflected the language of an adult, but I see no difficulty in this. No complaint was made that the substance of the direction was not appropriate, the complaint being confined to the fact that his Honour used the evidence itself to explain the direction. 
     
      
    31 I do not accept that his Honour’s direction diminished the significance of the appellant’s evidence. It may be that because he gave his evidence in an emphatic fashion, a description justified by an examination of the transcript, the jury may have been inclined to think less of his credibility. However, his Honour’s explanation of the appellant’s demeanour would have been likely to diminish any adverse impression formed by the jury. Furthermore, as was plainly the case, his Honour ensured that the jury understood that, having regard to the way the Crown case was presented, if the appellant was to maintain his innocence his only course was to deny each of the allegations. 
     
      
    32 It was submitted that the jury would also have been inappropriately influenced by a remark which his Honour made when the complainant was giving evidence. The complainant became distressed and was crying. His Honour intervened to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “You’re fine. You’ve given the answers you’re supposed to give.” 
        
       
      
    33 I accept that his Honour’s statement was ambiguous. However, in the context I do not believe it would have had any impact on the outcome of the trial. The complainant was entitled to reassurance during the stressful experience of giving evidence and his Honour merely intended to convey to her that she was responding appropriately to the questions. I do not believe the jury would have formed the opinion that his Honour was passing judgment on the integrity of her evidence.  
     
      
    34 The further complaint made with respect to the trial judge’s summing up relates to his Honour’s remarks concerning the cross-examination of witnesses with respect to matters of credit. When giving these directions his Honour gave an illustration from the evidence given in the case. The complaint was that by referring to the evidence his Honour’s remarks tended to unfairly support the Crown case. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An inference is a fact that can be drawn from two other established facts and if I can give you an example here. If you accept that [the school teacher] directly following the complaint by [the complainant] to her from when she had made arrangements with [the complainant] as to what she should do in the immediate future went straight around to the principal’s office and filled in a form directed to the Department of Community Services as she is required by law to do. If you accept that that is what happened and then if you also accept that [the complainant] spoke to police after this complaint was made it is a reasonable inference that [the teacher’s] report went to the Department of Community Services and then from the police and the police came and visited [the complainant] at her home or at the school, more probably at her home.” 
        
       
      
    35 To my mind the complaint has no foundation. Indeed, by drawing upon the evidence to illustrate the nature of an available inference his Honour was providing the jury with more assistance than is sometimes given by the typical illustrations used by trial judges. I can see no potential for this direction to have unfairly influenced the jury. 
     
      
    36 His Honour then turned to consider the matter of “cross-examination on credit.” His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “These are matters which are not central to the case and the aim is to show a witness in such a light that you would think less of that witness’s evidence and place less credence in it.” 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour reminded the jury that the complainant’s mother and step-mother had been cross-examined as to how they had cared for the children. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has really got nothing to do with this case and it was just to show that as far as BS was concerned she did not have a very high regard for the mother’s care of the children … .” 
        
       
      
    38 The evidence to which his Honour referred was statements which various witnesses had made during the course of contested family law proceedings in relation to the custody of the children. His Honour’s remarks that the matters were not central to the case were correct. His Honour was concerned to ensure that the jury were not diverted from the task of determining whether the appellant had committed the alleged offence by the controversy which surrounded the family court proceedings. To my mind the directions which he gave were not unbalanced or unfair to the appellant. 
     
      
    39 The appellant complains that the trial judge unfairly emphasised the importance of the Crown case when he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You must determine on that evidence whether or not you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on the Crown case and you must not go beyond that and you must not speculate.” 
        
       
      
    40 His Honour went onto say: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is just upon that material that you must decide the issue in this case.” 
        
       
      
    41 This is also the subject of complaint. 
     
      
    42 It was submitted that his Honour’s reference “to the Crown case” could have conveyed to the jury that they should give more weight to the Crown case than the case presented by the appellant. 
     
      
    43 A few lines further on in the transcript his Honour directed the jury in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “What you are required to do today is determine the facts, to fit those facts to the law as I give it to you, and to decide whether or not you are satisfied on the Crown case beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    44 It was submitted that the combination of these directions meant that the trial judge unfairly emphasised to the jury that they should consider the Crown case without referring to the defence case. It was submitted that the judge was in error when he said that the jury was required to determine the facts and fit those facts to the law when the jury’s task was to consider the facts in the light of the directions of law which the trial judge gave them. 
     
      
    45 I am not persuaded that the directions contain any relevant error. No doubt a formulation with greater clarity could have been provided. However, the effect of his Honour’s directions was to make plain to the jury that they were to examine the evidence, find the facts and consider them having regard to the law. They were to consider the Crown case and only if satisfied of that case beyond reasonable doubt could they convict. They were informed that in carrying out their task they must find the relevant facts and in light of the directions which they had been given as to the legal elements of the offence, determine whether they were satisfied that the Crown had proved its case to the relevant standard. In my opinion the complaint about these directions is not justified.  
     
      
    46 His Honour later turned to consider the evidence in relation to complaint. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now I turn to the matter of complaint. It has been thought in generations past that if a woman or a female of any age was sexually assaulted that she would complain about it to someone in authority and if she did not so complain that some shadow would fall upon across her credit (sic) and her evidence would be less regarded because of the absence of prompt complaint. It is a very old historical concept and tied into something called the hue and cry which was the raising of a group of people to go and arrest a person who had committed the sexual assault and it goes back centuries. In this case, as you are aware complaint was not made in relation to the first matter until some 4 years after the event. It was not made on the second allegation until 4 years or thereabouts had elapsed and it is unknown how long it was when the third allegation (sic) before complaint was made and even with the last one it was something in the order of 3 months. Now you have to take into consideration that this is a child who is complaining. With a young child the child may not know the nature of what is being done to her or that she ought to complain about it.” 
        
       
      
    47 It was submitted that his Honour’s reference to the history of complaint “in the context of this case” again had the effect of bolstering the evidence of the complainant. In support of this submission the appellant emphasised the fact that his Honour said that the jury “have to take into consideration that this is a child complaining.” The appellant referred to the later directions which were said to exacerbate the problems with this earlier direction. His Honour later said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The abuse had gone on from about second class at the time she complained about it. Now you must take all of these matters into consideration before you say, well the complaint was so late that there must be some shadow which falls upon or across her credit and it becomes harder to believe her.” 
        
       
      
    48 It was submitted that his Honour unfairly ameliorated any concern which the jury may have felt about the lateness of the complaint by inviting the jury to “think of a particular date four years ago and tell me precisely what occurred on that date.” 
     
      
    49 I am not persuaded that the directions which his Honour gave about the evidence of complaint were erroneous. In my judgment his Honour was concerned to ensure that the jury understood the approach which they must take to the evaluation of the evidence of complaint. In so doing it was appropriate that his Honour remind the jury of the evidence in this case so that they could approach their task with a clear understanding of the principles which his Honour had enunciated and how they related to the evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    50 His Honour’s invitation to the jury to reflect upon whether they could identify what occurred on a date four years ago was given with the intention of assisting the appellant’s position. His Honour had reminded the jury of the disadvantage to the appellant because of the lateness of the complaint, in particular the fact that the appellant would have difficulty providing an account of his movements on any particular day. The invitation to the jury to consider whether they could recollect the events of four years ago was intended to reinforce in the jury’s mind that the lateness of complaint could operate as a significant disadvantage to the appellant. 
     
      
    51 On more than one occasion his Honour used the expression “were you mindful to convict.” On one occasion his Honour said “you should therefore be satisfied both as to her truthfulness and the accuracy of her recall were you mindful to convict.” On another occasion his Honour said when referring to the multiple allegations “of those you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt if you’re mindful to convict him of the one count in this indictment.” 
     
      
    52 Although in some contexts use of the expression “mindful to convict” may have created difficulties I am satisfied that there were no problems in the present case. All that the jury was told was that if they were considering whether to convict they would first have to be satisfied of the relevant matters. 
     
      
    53 Later in the summing up his Honour commenced a review of the four occasions identified in the indictment. It was submitted that when in this context his Honour said: “Now that is all that the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt.” It was submitted that his Honour’s remarks would have bolstered the prosecution case. There are other examples of his Honour using this form of language.  
     
      
    54 I can see no difficulty in this direction. His Honour was merely being careful to ensure that the jury understood the elements of the offence having regard to the evidence tendered in the Crown case. His Honour, as to my mind was appropriate, was directing the jury that although there was other evidence it was not evidence that was relevant to proving a particular offence. 
     
      
    55 Complaint was made in relation to his Honour’s directions with respect to the third occasion – the attempt of sexual intercourse count. His Honour gave the jury an illustration of an “attempt” by reference to a hypothetical event totally removed from the case. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In this case the complainant said that this time she screamed when the accused placed his penis at her vagina because it hurt so much and that intervening reaction the Crown says caused it to be an attempt and not a completed criminal act.” 
        
       
      
    56 It was submitted that by referring to the complainant’s evidence his Honour unfairly bolstered the Crown case. I reject this submission. By referring to the evidence his Honour assisted the jury in obtaining an accurate understanding of the manner in which the Crown alleged that the actions of the appellant constituted a relevant element in the offence. 
     
      
    57 After giving the jury general directions his Honour turned to consider the evidence in both the Crown case and the case of the appellant. Complaint was made that his Honour spent excessive time summarising the evidence of the complainant when he said he had gone through the videos “as carefully as I can” and had selected matters relevant to each of the four occasions referred to in the indictment. His Honour undertook this task in order to assist the jury. It was submitted that this was illegitimate because it put his Honour’s imprimatur on the facts. To my mind this submission should be rejected. All that his Honour was doing was ensuring that the jury was reminded of the evidence relevant to each charge. 
     
      
    58 Complaint was also made that his Honour’s summary of the appellant’s evidence occupied only a short time. However, this was inevitable. The appellant’s case was itself brief consisting of a denial of every allegation made by the complainant. 
     
      
    59 After inviting the jury to retire to consider its verdict his Honour, in the usual manner, invited counsel to raise any matter of concern. Some matters were raised and his Honour gave further directions to the jury during which he said “bear in mind any of the other warnings I have given you … .” It was submitted that his Honour should have said “all of the warnings.” This submission is without substance. His Honour clearly invited the jury to consider all of the warnings which he had given. 
     
      
    60 Finally, complaint is made about a direction recorded in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “You would have to inspect her evidence with great particularity before you accepted it or before, having accepted it, it would raise in your mind a satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt.” 
        
       
      
    61 If this is an accurate record of the direction the language used was not elegant. However, having regard to the whole of the summing up I am not satisfied it would have caused any difficulty. The jury were being instructed to consider the complainant’s evidence with great care and, only if satisfied of the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt, return a guilty verdict. 
     
      
    62 Although his Honour invited counsel to raise any matter of concern in relation to the summing up there was no suggestion of the problems now raised under the first ground of appeal. Other matters were referred to and his Honour gave further directions. In these circumstances r 4 applies. It is apparent that counsel at the trial was not concerned about any lack of balance or objectivity in his Honour’s summing up. To my mind, having regard to both the particular directions identified by the appellant and, more importantly those directions in the context of the entire summing up the complaints which the appellant now makes are without justification. I would refuse leave in relation to ground 1 of the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – the trial judge erred in directing the jury that credit (was) not central to the Crown case thus giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
       
      
    63 I have already considered the direction which his Honour gave in relation to credit to which ground 2 refers. It is important to appreciate the entire direction. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There has been quite a deal of cross examination on credit, if I can explain that to you. These are matters which are not central to the case and the aim is to show a witness in such a light that you would think less of the witness’s evidence and place less credence in it.” 
        
       
      
    64 This direction was correct. I reject ground 2 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – the trial judge erred in directing the jury that they were required to “determine the facts (and) to fit these facts to the law as I give it to you” 
       
      
    65 I have already considered this direction. It contains no error and I reject ground 3 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – his Honour erred in admitting evidence of complaint 
       
      
    66 The time span in relation to the fourth occasion of sexual abuse was identified as 1 January 2004 to 8 June 2004. Complaint was made to the teacher on 1 September 2004, some 12 weeks later. The third occasion was said to have taken place towards the end of 2003 or early 2004. The time span with respect to the first and second occasions was further removed being some 18 months prior to the complaint.  
     
      
    67 It was submitted that in the circumstances of the present case the admission of evidence of complaint was erroneous. 
     
      
    68 The trial judge considered the issue at a hearing on the voir dire. His Honour found that complaint was first made to the school teacher following a lesson within the scope of the Department of Education’s module on Child Protection. The complaint was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms C I have been sexually abused.” 
        
       
      
    69 The teacher replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am sorry to hear that G. Is it from where you live now? 
        
       
      
    70 The complainant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “It’s mum’s partner … .” 
        
       
      
    71 The teacher advised the complainant to inform her stepmother. She also filled in the prescribed form which gave notice of the complaint to the Department of Community Services. 
     
      
    72 His Honour found that the complainant informed her stepmother saying “I have been sex abused” and named the appellant. When asked “When was the last time this happened” the complainant replied “About a month before we came here.” His Honour determined this to be some time in the month of May 2004. She was then interviewed by the police who conducted three interviews. 
     
      
    73 His Honour reviewed the evidence of the events related by the complainant and found that her proposed evidence in chief indicated “a gradual progression from digital penetration and indecent assault to forceful fellatio and attempted penetration. These incidents occurred in intervals of two or three weeks.” 
     
      
    74 His Honour’s factual finding was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “One might fairly conclude that each successive incident would have reinforced the previous one and the last being a radical departure from the others, a matter to which the complainant would attach significance.” 
        
       
      
    75 After reviewing the authorities his Honour quoted from Shipworth v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 37 where Mason P said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As to what the complainant told her mother, the appellant submits that the evidence should not have been admitted as evidence of the truth of the matter represented because it was not 'fresh in the memory of' the complainant when she spoke to her mother. It was not admissible pursuant to s66 of the Evidence Act and the principles stated in cases such as  
        Graham v The Queen  
        (1998) 195 CLR 606 and  
        Papakosmos v The Queen  
        (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 309-310. This point was not raised at trial and there is nothing to suggest miscarriage of justice stemmed from the admission of the evidence. 
         
         
        The time gap (66 days) was not great and there is every reason why the memory the of events was sufficiently fresh to make the evidence admissible on this wider basis. The jury were able to assess the reasons for and the impact of delay."" 
         
         
         
        The trial judge then said: 
         
         
        ""I regard the instruction of 1 September not as some trigger to recollection, but as demonstrating to the eleven year old complainant a course which she should and did take. I regard both of the women who heard her complaint as merely receiving it. Neither sought to elicit information from her or to encourage any embellishment. 
         
         
        As to 'fresh in the memory' I remain guided by the High Court but questions of fact and degree do here obtain. Attempted penile penetration, being as it was a departure from a more settled practise of criminal assaults, would have remained fresh in the memory of the child, satisfying both the test of recency and the test of being unchanged by the lapse of time."" 
        
       
      
    76 His Honour determined that the evidence should be admitted. 
     
      
    77 Because evidence of complaint is hearsay s 59 of the Evidence Act would in the ordinary course deny its admission. However, s 66 provides that evidence of complaint will be admissible if the complainant is called or is to be called to give evidence and if “when the (complaint) representation was made the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation.” 
     
      
    78 The High Court considered s 66 in Graham v The Queen (1998) 195 CLR 606. In that case the complaint of sexual assault was made six years after the last acts alleged against the accused. The High Court determined that evidence of the complaint was not admissible. Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ held that the word “fresh” in the context of s 66 means “recent” or “immediate.” Their Honours said that it “may also carry with it a connotation that describes the quality of the memory (as being “not deteriorated or changed by lapse of time”) but the core of the meaning intended, is to describe the temporal relationship between “the occurrence of the asserted fact” and the time of making the representation.” Although questions of fact and degree may arise, the temporal relationship required will very likely be measured in hours or days, not as was the case here, in years” (p 608). 
     
      
    79 Callinan J, with whom Gleeson CJ agreed, said of s 66 of the Act that “whilst it cannot be doubted that the quality or vividness of a recollection will generally be relevant in an assessment of its freshness, its contemporaniety or near contemporaneity, or otherwise will almost always be the most important consideration in any assessment of its freshness” (p 614). 
     
      
    80 The High Court was concerned in Graham to provide guidance in the application of s 66 to encourage certainty in its application and avoid the necessity of voir dire hearings. In this context Callinan J emphasised that although there may be cases in which evidence of an event relatively remote in time will be admissible “such cases will necessarily be rare and requiring of some special circumstance or feature” (p 614) (see also Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297). 
     
      
    81 There have been cases where this Court has supported the admission of evidence of a complaint which was not contemporaneous with the alleged event complained of. In R v Vinh Le [2000] NSWCCA 49 evidence of events occurring over a six month period were held to be admissible because of the “constant refreshing effect of the regular repetition” of the behaviour (per Sully J [53]). Hidden J expressed the view that s 66 would allow the admission of complaint about a pattern of behaviour extending over months [126]. However, Hulme J doubted whether in light of the decision in Graham this view was open [84]. (see also the decision of this Court in Skipworth v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 37. 
     
      
    82 In the present case evidence was given of two occasions when complaint was made. One was to the school teacher. This was a somewhat general complaint to the effect that the complainant had been sexually abused by the appellant at a place other than where she was then living. Evidence was also given by BS who said that the complainant complained to her on 1 September 2004 and referred to a number of incidents the last of which took place in May of that year. 
     
      
    83 In these circumstances, in my judgment, the evidence of complaint should not have been admitted pursuant to s 66. It is difficult to identify the reasons for the trial judge’s decision to admit the evidence. Notwithstanding the High Court’s concern that the temporal relationship between the alleged event and the complaint would likely be measured in hours or days his Honour concluded that the gap “was not great and there is every reason why the memory of events was sufficiently fresh to make the evidence admissible.” This conclusion is not explained and in my view cannot be reconciled with Callinan J’s expectation that before it will be admissible the complaint must be contemporaneous or nearly so with the alleged event. 
     
      
    84 Section 66 provides an exception to the hearsay rule in the circumstance where the alleged event provokes a contemporaneous complaint. Because of the proximity in time the account of the event given by the complainant to the person receiving the account given is accepted as likely to be accurate. Where days or months pass since the events, the account given by the complainant will most likely suffer from the frailties of human recollection. 
     
      
    85 In my judgment the lapse of time, in fact 85 days, in the present case was so significant that the asserted facts could not have been fresh in the memory of the complainant. Although I accept that the trial judge had the advantage of the testimony on the voir dire in relation to the issue, which is a question of fact, in my judgment his conclusion was not open. There were no extraordinary circumstances permitting departure from “contemporaneity or near contemporaneity” as the test by which to assess whether the relevant occurrence was fresh in the complainant’s memory. 
     
      
    86 After his Honour had given judgment on the admissibility of the complaint evidence the appellant’s counsel indicated that it would be submtted that the complainant’s allegations were the result of suggestions made to her. In response the prosecutor indicated that she would seek to use the complaint evidence as a matter going to credit (s 108(3) of the Act). His Honour did not rule in relation to the issue but indicated that the evidence of complaint would be before the jury in any event and the prosecutor would be able to make any submission which the evidence supported and, accordingly, it was not necessary to pursue that matter. 
     
      
    87 When the complainant was cross examined it was suggested to her that after she had spent 3 months with her father in 2003 she had not wanted to return to live with her mother. She had in fact returned to live with her mother until mid 2004. However, she agreed that she had told her father that she did not want to go back to live with her mother because of her mother’s abuse of drugs and because she was afraid of the appellant. It was suggested to her that her allegations of sexual abuse were untrue and that she had made them up because she wanted to stay with her father. 
     
      
    88 Similar suggestions were made when BS was cross-examined and were also made to the complainant’s father, AS. 
     
      
    89 In his address to the jury counsel for the appellant pursued this suggestion and submitted that the complainant “just wanted to do anything to get away from” her mother’s household. It was also suggested that the jury should have a real concern about the honesty of AS and BS, particularly in relation to the custody proceedings with respect to the children. The suggestion, although veiled, was that AS and BS had made suggestions to the complainant with a view to them being repeated by her, which would be of considerable impact in the custody proceedings. In these circumstances the respondent submitted that the complaints to the school teacher and the step-mother should be available to the jury to rebut, or at least place in context, the suggestion of fabrication or suggestion. If the jury thought that the complainant may have simply been taken to the police by her father and/or step-mother the suggestion of fabrication or suggestion may have been attractive to the jury. If, however, they were aware that the initial disclosure was made to an independent person, who had then advised her to tell her step-mother, they may take a different view. 
     
      
    90 It was submitted that accordingly if an application for leave to adduce the evidence pursuant to s 108 of the Act had been made it would inevitably have been granted. 
     
      
    91 In my opinion this submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    92 Section 108 of the Act, as enacted in New South Wales is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence adduced in re-examination of a witness. 
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) (Repealed)  
         
        
       
       
        
        Note. 
         The Commonwealth Act includes a subsection referring to section 105 of that Act. 
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The credibility rule does not apply to evidence of a prior consistent statement of a witness if:  
         
          
           
          (a) evidence of a prior inconsistent statement of the witness has been admitted, or 
           
          (b) it is or will be suggested (either expressly or by implication) that evidence given by the witness has been fabricated or re-constructed (whether deliberately or otherwise) or is the result of a suggestion, 
           
          and the court gives leave to adduce the evidence of the prior consistent statement.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    93 The complexities of the section have been considered on a number of occasions by this Court (R v DBG [2002] NSWCCA 328, 133 A Crim R 227; R v MDB [2005] NSWCCA 354. However, the present case does not require a detailed analysis of the section. The attack upon the complainant’s credibility by the assertion that she was responding to the suggestion of AS and BS with consequences for the family law proceedings, together with the furtherance of her own desire to live with her father, are contrary to the evidence that she reported that she had been abused when the issue was raised by the teacher. Evidence of the conversation with the teacher followed by the conversation with her stepmother contradicts any suggestion that it was her father or stepmother who encouraged or provoked the complaint. 
     
      
    94 Before the evidence could have been admitted pursuant to s 108 leave was required which would have raised for consideration the matters in s 192. Given the nature of the proceedings and the suggestion that the complainant may have fabricated her evidence for ulterior purposes the evidence complained of has a particular significance in the trial. It did not add significantly to the length of the trial and in my judgment if the question had been raised leave would inevitably have been granted. 
     
      
    95 Given that, as I have stated in [83], his Honour erred in admitting the evidence under s 66 of the Evidence Act I am satisfied that no miscarriage of justice occurred. The evidence of the complaint to the school teacher was brief and lacked detail of particular events. The complaint to the step-mother had more detail although not significantly greater. The evidence of complaint added little if anything to the detail of the events given by the complainant in the lengthy recorded police interview which followed shortly thereafter. 
     
      
       
      Ground 6 – his Honour erred in his directions on the Markuleski principle (R v Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82) 
       
      
    96 After his Honour had completed his summing up he invited counsel to raise any matters of concern. Counsel for the appellant asked for a Markuleski direction. 
     
      
    97 When the jury returned his Honour reminded the jury of the details of the matters relied on by the Crown as constituting the offence in the indictment. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, if you disbelieve [the complainant] on any of these four matters, then that would affect her credit on the other three. You have to bear that in mind because it would be a matter of credit and it would affect her credit and it would flow over into the other 3 matters.” 
        
       
      
    98 No issue was raised by trial counsel with this form of direction. However, it was submitted that the jury should have been carefully instructed in conformity with s 66EA(7) of the Act that they were to consider each of the four occasions separately. It was further submitted that they should have been told that it was necessary for them to consider each occasion as if it were a separate count in an indictment and directed the jury to the effect that a reasonable doubt with respect to the complainant’s evidence in relation to any occasion ought to be taken into account when assessing the complainant’s credit generally. 
     
      
    99 The directions considered in Markuleski are not required in all cases (see Spigelman CJ at [187] and Hajje v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 23 at [102]). Even when a direction is required a precise wording has not been mandated. 
     
      
    100 The defence case at trial was that the complainant had fabricated the entirety of the alleged misconduct. In reality the jury either accepted her evidence entirely or rejected it. In these circumstances I doubt whether a direction was required. In any event I am satisfied that the direction which his Honour gave was adequate to deal with the issue. Although in the passage I have quoted his Honour refers to “disbelieve” his Honour continued to warn the jury about the care with which they must approach the complainant’s evidence and the need for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour had earlier emphasised on a number of occasions that the jury was required to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    101 The absence of any concern expressed by trial counsel confirms that in the context of the entire summing up the issue was adequately addressed. I would refuse leave to raise ground 6. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    102 Two grounds were advanced in support of this application. Firstly complaint is made of a failure to find special circumstances. Secondly, it was submitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    103 The maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 25 years. The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7½ years with a further term of 2½ years. His Honour found that the offence was in the medium range of seriousness. The appellant pleaded not guilty and his Honour found an absence of contrition.  
     
      
    104 His Honour identified the offence as having caused grave harm to the complainant and indicated that the sentence must reflect the need for general deterrence. 
     
      
    105 The appellant relied on a combination of matters as constituting special circumstances. Being without criminal antecedents and of prior good character it was submitted that there was a need for rehabilitation and extended supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. It was also submitted that this would be the appellant’s first custodial sentence and, by reason of the nature of the offence, he would serve his sentence in the more onerous circumstances of protective custody. 
     
      
    106 The rehabilitation of sexual offenders has been the subject of consideration by this Court in a number of cases dealing with the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (see Attorney-General for the State of NSW v Winters [2007] NSWSC 1071; Attorney-General for the State of NSW v Tillman [2007] NSWSC 605). 
     
      
    107 A program known as CUBIT has been developed and is available within the prison system to sexual offenders. It is an intensive course and requires the offender to undergo group therapy sessions for a period varying between 8 to 12 months. In relation to a serious sex offender the view has been taken that in most cases it would not be appropriate to release an offender to parole until they have successfully completed the course. When first developed the course required the offender to acknowledge their guilt before they could be admitted for treatment. This has been recently modified and offenders may now be admitted even if they do not acknowledge their guilt. However, the success of the treatment program will depend upon a number of factors and cannot be reliably predicted. 
     
      
    108 In the present case his Honour considered the submission of counsel that he should find special circumstances. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As far as special circumstances are concerned, it has been submitted by his counsel that his lack of criminal antecedent and prior good character, his need for supervision and rehabilitation and the fact that this is (his) first custodial sentence, coupled with the fact that he will be serving his sentence in more onerous circumstances than most, may together represent special circumstances within the meaning of the Act. However, I have no evidence before me [on] how he will serve his sentence, nor have I any evidence upon which I could prophesy with certitude that he would have good prospects of rehabilitation. The prior good character and first occasion of imprisonment have been expressly rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal as special circumstances. Special circumstances within the meaning of the Act must be something which is extraordinary, remarkable or unique to the prisoner and such circumstances cannot be constructed out of the matters which are of themselves without that quality, however many there be.” 
        
       
      
    109 Although his Honour’s reasons are brief it is apparent that each of the submissions made by counsel were considered. In the exercise of his discretion his Honour was not prepared to make a finding of special circumstances. I can detect no error. 
     
      
    110 In R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 this Court referred to the line of decided cases of the High Court, since Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623, in which the words “special circumstances” have appeared. Some cases have emphasised consideration of all relevant circumstances, including the need for rehabilitation, for the purpose of determining what the minimum period of actual incarceration should be. However, the fixing of a non-parole period is not solely or primarily dependent upon considerations of rehabilitation (at [59]).  
     
      
    111 In the present case there is clearly a need for the rehabilitation of the appellant. Whether he will be able to successfully complete the CUBIT program is unknown. However, it is likely that before he could be released to parole the program will have to be undertaken. Upon the assumption that he successfully completes the program he could be released to parole 2 ½ years before the completion of his sentence. During this time his rehabilitation may continue under appropriate supervision. In the circumstances I see no reason why his rehabilitation required a shorter term of full time custody. 
     
      
    112 It may be accepted that the appellant was to be sentenced as a person without criminal antecedents. However, whether this justified a finding of special circumstances has been questioned (see R v Kama (2001) 110 A Crim R 47 at [15]; R v Kaliti (2001) NSWCCA 268 at [10]; R v Christoph (2003) 140 A Crim R 45 at [67]). The significance of a lack of criminal antecedents may also be less significant when the offence involves the course of conduct over a number of years. (see Kaliti at [8]-[9]; R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at [45]-[60] for a discussion of affording less weight to prior good character and lack of prior convictions especially in child sexual assault and drug trafficking cases). 
     
      
    113 Although it was submitted that the appellant may have to spend his time in custody in more onerous conditions by reason of the nature of his offence there was no evidence to this effect. As I understand the current position arrangements are made for sexual offenders to be accommodated separately from the general prison population. However, they do not serve their sentences in isolation. Without evidence I could not accept that these conditions are more onerous than for other offenders (see R v Mostyn (2004) 145 A Crim R 304; R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; R v Merrin (2001) NSWCCA 255; R v Potier (2004) NSWCCA 136 at [93]). 
     
      
    114 In the circumstances his Honour did not err by failing to find special circumstances.  
     
      
    115 The offence of persistent sexual abuse contrary to s 66EA carries a maximum prison term of 25 years. It is a more serious offence than the offences which comprise the individual acts. The first incident alleged in the indictment would have been an offence against s 66A of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non parole period of 15 years. The second matter would have been an offence against s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty was 10 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 5 years. The third matter would have been an offence against s 61J and s 61P of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty was 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The fourth matter would have been an offence against s 66C of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty was 20 years and in respect of which there was no standard non parole period. 
     
      
    116 Having regard to the range of penalties in respect of the individual acts the sentence which his Honour imposed was not excessive. The appellant pleaded not guilty and was convicted after trial. There is no indication of any contrition and his prospects of rehabilitation are unknown. The offence continued over a significant period of time. The appellant was in a position of trust to the complainant which was seriously breached. 
     
      
    117 A measure of the severity of the sentence can be gauged by consideration of the penalty which would have been available in relation to the first incident if separately charged. The trial judge found the offence to be in the mid range and in my opinion this would have been an appropriate description of the first incident. A mid range offence would carry the standard non parole period of 15 years. In the present case the overall sentence was 10 years and the non parole period 7½ years. His Honour determined the offence to be within the mid range and in these circumstances the sentence which his Honour imposed was not excessive. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      1. The appeal against conviction is dismissed

    1 HIS HONOUR: Nine men, the accused, have been charged with conspiracy to do acts in preparation for, or planning, a terrorist act or acts, contrary to s 11.5 and 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. This is a very serious charge. The legislation provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life for this category of offence.  
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    2 The pre-trial procedures relating to these charges commenced at the new Parramatta Court complex last Monday. As it happened, by coincidence, the trial of 12 other men accused of terrorism offences in Melbourne began before a judge and jury in Melbourne on 13 February 2008.  
     
      
    3 Last week two counsel for the accused in the present trial went to Melbourne and were granted leave to intervene in that trial for a limited purpose. An application was made before the Melbourne trial judge, Bongiorno J, seeking certain non-publication or suppression orders in relation to the reporting of certain material emanating, or likely to, from the Melbourne trial. Particularly, an order was sought to achieve the proposed suppression by requiring the media to refer to one of the Melbourne accused by a pseudonym, ""C"" or ""Mr C""; secondly, an order was sought to prohibit the naming of the Sydney accused, either individually, or by any collective title or reference.  
     
      
    4 As I understand it, these orders were sought on the basis that, if granted, they would protect the Sydney accused from being tried by a Sydney jury, chosen from a population which had been exposed to media reports of the Victorian trial as it progressed. In particular, concern was expressed as to Sydney exposure to the Melbourne Crown's allegation against one of the accused, Benbrika, and to his and the other defendants' connection with the Sydney accused.  
     
      
    5 I should mention that senior counsel for the Crown in the Melbourne trial, Mr Maidment SC, had indicated early in the proceedings that for the purposes of the opening and throughout the trial generally, any mention of the Sydney accused in the Melbourne proceedings would be limited to their first names and no mention would be made of their surnames.  
     
      
    6 The intervention proceedings took place on 20 February 2008. Counsel heard on the application included Mr Bellew of senior counsel who represented the Sydney Crown, as I shall for convenience and clarity refer to it; and Dr McEvoy who appeared with leave for all the major media interests. As I understand it, all major local and national media interests were represented, except for Channel 10 and SBS.  
     
      
    7 On 21 February 2008 Bongiorno J refused the interveners' substantive application, but suppressed details about the application itself until further order. Essentially his Honour held that the time factors involved were unlikely to lead to prejudice and that, in any event, suitable directions could be given by the Sydney trial judge to protect the capacity of adverse publicity attaching to Mr Benbrika from impacting upon the jury's task.  
     
      
    8 Secondly, his Honour thought that the Sydney trial judge would be in a better position than he was, or would be, to ensure that the Sydney accused could be tried fairly; and in a better position to adjudicate from time to time upon any matter arising from media reports that might have a tendency to interfere with the fair trial of the Sydney accused.  
     
      
       
      The present proceedings 
       
      
    9 I turn now to the present proceedings. The summons in the present proceedings has been brought on behalf of all the Sydney accused. For the purposes of this argument it has been principally presented by Mr Waterstreet and Mr Lange of counsel. They are the counsel for the accused Khaled Cheikho, but as I have said, with the agreement of all parties they are representing all of the accused in relation to the relief sought in the summons. Mr Scragg of counsel appears in this trial with Mr Carroll for the accused Jamal. I have permitted Mr Scragg to make separate submissions for his clients in relation to the present matter. The defendants are John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited and Nationwide News Limited. Although not expressly named as defendants, Mr Blackburn SC sought leave to appear as well on behalf of a number of other major media interests and this situation was permitted. Mr Bellew SC made submissions on behalf of the Sydney Crown in relation to the relief sought in the summons.  
     
      
    10 The summons originally sought an injunction prohibiting publication of any of the following information which may be adduced during the evidence at the trial in Melbourne:  
     
      
       
        
        1. The names of the Sydney accused, whether in whole or in part; 
         
         
        2. Any collective reference to those accused and especially a reference to Sydney or any of its geographical parts; 
         
         
        3. Any reference to the activities of any of the accused charged in the Melbourne proceedings which take place in Sydney, as having taken place in Sydney or any of its geographical parts; or 
         
         
        4. Or any reference to any of the accused as coming from Sydney or any of the geographical parts. 
         
         
        
       
      
    11 By leave, an additional paragraph was permitted to the summons and it has become paragraph 5 of the relief sought. It is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        5. Any reference to the accused Abdul Nacer Benbrika and any publication in New South Wales, except for the pseudonym ""C"" or ""Mr C"".  
        
       
      
    12 I should add in addition to the relief sought in the summons, Mr Scragg, on behalf of his client, sought a temporary stay of the trial, although this application was not generally favoured by the other accused. Essentially, Mr Scragg's application was based on the same material relied upon by the other accused in their application for an injunction.  
     
      
    13 Before going into the statement of the general nature of the Crown case against the accused and to the substantive arguments, it is necessary to make one further observation. The Melbourne intervention was sought on the basis of an express statutory power available in Victoria, but not in New South Wales. This is a reference to ss 18 and 19 of the Supreme Court Act 1986 of Victoria. Such an express power is not available in New South Wales. There is a clear line of authorities in New South Wales to which I will later make reference. These very considerably restrict the ability of the court to suppress or prohibit fair reporting of proceedings in a civil or criminal trial.  
     
      
    14 Mr Lange has candidly made it clear to this court that one of the principal reasons for issuing separate proceedings seeking an injunction is that the principles underlying the issue of such an injunction may, to a limited degree, be more favourable to his side than the application of the principles of open justice, to which I have made reference in circumstances, where a suppression order is sought.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    15 The nature of the case against each of the accused is set out in the Crown case statement. This is a very long and detailed statement. It is inappropriate for me to do other than make brief mention of it in relation to the present proceedings. A decision is required urgently and this judgment must, in many respects, be relatively brief to cater for and take account of that urgency.  
     
      
    16 The nine accused are, as I have said, alleged to be parties to the conspiracy involved in the present charge. The prosecution case is that each of the conspirators considers himself to be a devout Muslim; each held certain beliefs in common relating to his interpretation of the Muslim faith. These common beliefs included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Islam throughout the world has been under attack and there is a religious obligation to come to the defence of Islam and other Muslims; 
         
         
        (b) Jihad is the primary means by which this obligation should be fulfilled; 
         
         
        (c) A significant and legitimate aspect of fulfilment of this obligation is violent jihad. This involves the application of force and violence, including in certain circumstances, the killing of infidels (that is persons who do not have the same fundamental beliefs).""  
        
       
      
    17 As a consequence of the holding of these common beliefs, the Crown alleges that the conspirators entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or ability to prepare to do a terrorist act. This involved equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to prepare for, or plan, a terrorist act. In furtherance of the agreement, the Crown case is that the conspirators:  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Obtained or attempted to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used directly and/or indirectly in the construction of an explosive device or devices; (punctuation) 
         
         
        (b) Obtained or attempted to obtain weaponry or ammunition; 
         
         
        (c) Possessed large amounts of extremist and instructional material."" 
        
       
      
    18 The Crown also asserts that in undertaking their activities, the conspirators became aware that they were being monitored by the authorities. Despite this awareness, each of the accused continued with their activities in relation to the implementation or carrying out of the conspiracy. The accused, however, displayed a high level of planning to avoid detection. There is no need for me to detail some of the covert means allegedly adopted, but it included the acquisition and use of mobile telephones in false names and the use of false names when making enquiries about purchases and other matters relating to the furtherance of the alleged conspiracy.  
     
      
    19 The Crown case in the present trial will include evidence concerning a Melbourne man, Abdul Benbrika. He was, according to the Crown case, an Islamist who publicly declared his support for militant or violent jihad. As I have earlier indicated, he was one of those charged in Melbourne relating to his principal role there in the terrorist organisation, which is the subject of the Melbourne charges currently being heard.  
     
      
    20 It will be alleged in the Sydney trial that Benbrika communicated with certain of the accused. For example, in Sydney, this contact was often covert in nature, involving for example airline travel being booked in false names. Benbrika had regular contact with five or six of the Sydney accused and there will be evidence of conversations intercepted on his telephone service in which extremist words were used or mentioned.  
     
      
    21 It is not, however, alleged by Crown that Benbrika is or was a co-conspirator with the Sydney accused. It is not suggested by the Crown that the Sydney accused were members of the Melbourne terrorist organisation. It is not suggested that the Sydney accused played a part in the Melbourne organisation's plan to advance the cause of violent jihad by explosive or violent activity in that state. It is not suggested that there was any joint conspiracy between the two groups to engage in any joint criminal enterprise of violent jihad.  
     
      
    22 I should interrupt the narrative at this stage to say one of the pre-trial applications that will loom large, probably next week, relates to the conspiracy charge. The defence are united in their applications that the court should in effect bring to an end the conspiracy charge. They will argue that the Crown should be left to allege substantive charges of preparation for a terrorist act or acts against each accused. For the moment, however, this judgment is given on the basis that the present conspiracy charges will stand.  
     
      
       
      Prejudice against the accused 
       
      
    23 May I now turn to the Melbourne trial. As I have said, senior counsel for the Crown began the Crown opening some days ago and, as I understand it, it is still continuing. The opening has been substantially reported in Victoria, New South Wales and no doubt elsewhere in Australia. The crux of the present application relates to the potential prejudice alleged on behalf of the accused arising out of material opened by the Crown in Melbourne, especially against Benbrika, and generally against his Melbourne co-accused. The particular concern is with material, which will not be duplicated in the Sydney trial. As I have indicated, the Benbrika connection is an important part of the Crown case in the Sydney trial, but it is limited and, overall, relatively minor in its scope and extent.  
     
      
    24 Both Mr Waterstreet and Mr Scragg have provided me with written summaries of aspects of the Crown opening in Melbourne. These summaries highlight certain behaviour by Benbrika alleged in the Melbourne proceedings, which will not be part of the case against the Sydney accused. They include the following: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Activities and communications between Benbrika and an undercover officer concerning explosive material; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Statements of Benbrika and his co-accused concerning the desirability of blowing up public areas such as football grounds or train stations. 
        
       
      
    25 This very brief summary does not attempt to embrace all of the matters alleged against Mr Benbrika in the Melbourne proceedings. There are many more and they are fully set out in the written submissions which have been provided to me. In the main, these matters do not form any part of the material that is to be led by the Crown in the Sydney trial.  
     
      
    26 I have also been provided with newspaper reports, some of which carry rather sensational headlines, about the evidence that will be adduced in the Melbourne trial against Benbrika and his Melbourne associates. 
     
      
    27 Mr Waterstreet has extracted a correlation between the name ""Benbrika"" and ""bombing"" or ""bombs"". This emerges from a Google search and there were literally thousands of entries matching the two words.  
     
      
    28 The gravamen of the arguments before me focuses upon two matters principally. The first is the asserted temporal connection between the Sydney trial and the Melbourne proceedings. It has been argued that although the Sydney trial may not start for some time, there is likely to be an area of overlap between the commencement of the Sydney trial and the conclusion of the Melbourne trial. Consequently, so the argument runs, there will be a potential for prejudice to taint members of the community who may form part of the jury pool. Thus will extend to the actual jury who are selected, if publication of damaging material about Mr Benbrika is to continue in the Sydney media unabated.  
     
      
    29 Secondly, it has been argued that although the more unfavourable and damaging publicity about Mr Benbrika is not to be introduced in the Sydney trial, Sydney readers or followers of the media generally will have had their minds poisoned about Mr Benbrika to such an extent that when the trial starts, the jury members will be likely to find the present accused guilty because of their association with such a repellent and dangerous person.  
     
      
    30 In response, the media argument queries whether there is any appropriate basis for the issue of an injunction at all. Mr Blackburn SC argues that there must be a legal or equitable basis to a right or rights, which are under threat before the issue of an injunction should be considered. (ABC v Lenah Game Meats Pty Limited) 208 CLR 199; 2001 HCA 63). 
     
      
    31 Secondly, he submitted that fair and accurate reporting of open court proceedings cannot constitute a contempt of court. (Re Consolidated Press Ex Parte Terrill (1937) SR NSW 255. 
     
      
    32 Thirdly, Mr Blackburn argued that the orders sought are not necessary to secure the administration of justice in the Sydney trial. In the same way it was submitted that binding authority makes it clear that in the absence of the statutory power, the court has no jurisdiction to make a non-publication order directed to persons generally, or to a particular class of person (such as the media) forbidding the publication of anything that happens in open court.  
     
      
    33 Mr Blackburn also submitted that, were the court minded to consider the making of a non-publication order and he conceded the possibility to do so existed in the present matter, it could only do so where there was material before the court from which it might reasonably conclude that it was really necessary to make the order, so as to secure the proper administration of justice in the proceedings before it. In any event, senior counsel argued that the order should not be made because it had not in fact been demonstrated they were really necessary to secure a fair trial for the accused. (Scott v Scott (1913) AC 417 at 477-8; Russell v Russell (1976) 134 CLR 495 at 520; John Fairfax & Sons Limited v Police Tribunal (NSW) (1986) 5 NSWLR 465 at 476). 
     
      
    34 Finally, Mr Blackburn provided the court with affidavit evidence from varying aspects of the media interests he is representing to demonstrate that it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to comply with orders of the kind sought. These affidavits raised factual considerations relating to the timing of media and press releases in different parts of Victoria and New South Wales and generally. As I said during argument, while these matters are no doubt capable of being regarded as relevant, practical considerations, they do not appear to me to bear upon the more fundamental question I have to decide; rather, they go to the content and extent of any of the orders that could or should be made if the court were to come to the conclusion that some type of protection were necessary in the present circumstances.  
     
      
    35 Mr Bellew's argument follows essentially the line of the matters that he had submitted before Bongiorno J in Melbourne. In particular, Mr Bellew stressed the important role that directions play throughout the process of a trial by jury. There is, of course, ample authority supporting that submission.  
     
      
    36 Mr Scragg's arguments essentially supported and developed, in perhaps more forceful terms, the arguments presented by both Mr Waterstreet and Mr Lange.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    37 I turn now to resolve the issues. There is a difficult preliminary argument. This relates to the question as to whether a quia timet injunction can issue in an anticipatory fashion to prevent a threatened contempt of court by a media outlet or outlets in circumstances such as the present. There is, of course, ample authority to the effect that the court may grant an injunction to enjoin publication of material, which is prejudicial to pending proceedings, but that, I would think, is not quite the same question. (United Telecasters Sydney v Hardy (1991) 23 NSWLR 323 at 332; Waterhouse v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1986) 6 NSWLR 716 at 719-720) 
     
      
    38 Even if it be accepted that the power claimed by Mr Lange does exist, it must be acknowledged, as I think he did, that its exercise will be a rare one and one to be exercised only in relatively circumscribed situations. (Herald and Weekly Times Pty Limited v A [2005] 160 A Crim R 299; Pickering v Liverpool Daily Post (1991) 2 AC 370). While the issue of an injunction to prevent a criminal contempt is not the imposition of a punishment for that contempt, it is nevertheless necessary to recall that such punishment is concerned with the protection of the public interests in the due administration of justice, including the vindication of the authorities of the courts. It is the undoubted position that, if there be a power to issue a quia timet injunction to restrain a threatened contempt of court in the present matter, it is of course not generally favoured by the law but, rather, is a power to be exercised sparingly.  
     
      
    39 My decision, as I have said, is required urgently in the present matter. As a consequence, rather than dwell upon this fairly difficult preliminary question, I have come to the conclusion that I should, without deciding it finally, make the assumption that I do have the power to grant the injunction that is sought. Secondly, I will make the assumption for the present moment that, despite the strictures on the issue of a suppression order presently applicable to this State, I also possess the power to make orders of the kind sought by the accused in the present matter. It may well be that the correct position is that no such orders can be made. 
     
      
    40 It is agreed on all sides that the accused in the present proceedings carry a heavy burden to restrict, by injunction, publication of material emerging in a criminal trial heard elsewhere in open Court. In addition, the principles of open justice would, in my opinion, have a reasonable level of application as part and parcel of the usual considerations involving the grant of an injunction, although those principles would not necessarily have an identical application as they do where a suppression or prohibition order is sought.  
     
      
    41 I have elsewhere summarised the authorities relating to the present law in this State related to those principles. (See Article in 2007 ALJ 743 at 752). One of the more recent cases on the point is the decision of the Court in John Fairfax Publications Pty Limited v District Court of New South Wales (2004) 61 NSWLR 344. The principles to be derived from that decision are to be found in the judgment of Spigelman CJ, with whom Handley JA and Campbell AJA agreed. 
     
      
    42 The principles may be summarised as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ”(1) Open justice is one of the most fundamental aspects of the system of justice in Australia. The conduct of proceedings in public is an essential quality of an Australian court of justice.  
         
         
        (2) Where the Court has an inherent or statutory jurisdiction to make a non-publication order, a test of necessity is ordinarily applied to the exercise of power to make such an order. A court can only depart from the fundamental rule that the administration of justice must take place in open Court where observance of the rule would frustrate the administration of justice or some other public interest for whose protection Parliament has modified the open justice rule. An order of the Court prohibiting the publication of evidence is only valid where it is really necessary to secure the proper administration of justice in the proceedings before it.  
         
         
        (3) An order prohibiting publication of evidence must be clear in its terms and do no more than is necessary to achieve the due administration of justice and the protection of the relevant public interest.  
         
         
        (4) The making of the order must also be reasonably necessary; and there must be some material before the Court upon which it can reasonably reach the conclusion that it is necessary to make an order prohibiting publication.  
         
         
        (5) It is well-established that the exceptions to the principles of open justice are few and strictly defined. It is now accepted that the Courts will not add to the list of exceptions but Parliament may do so, subject to any constitutional constraints.""  
        
       
      
    43 Consequently the questions I propose to pose for my determination are these:  
     
      
       
      (a) Have the accused satisfied me that an injunction is necessary in the present circumstances to protect the public interest in the due administration of justice or to maintain the integrity of the judicial process?  
       
       
      (b) Have the accused satisfied me in the present circumstances as to the test of necessity so far as the suppression or non-publication orders are concerned?  
       
      
    44 After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that I must answer each of these questions in the negative.  
     
      
    45 The first matter to be considered is the nature of the orders sought. It is quite clear to me that these have been both deliberately and carefully framed to suggest a minimal disturbance to the principles of open justice. Despite the care with which they have been crafted, they do not, in my view, disguise the fact, however, that what is proposed is a relatively substantial interference with the first principle of open justice I have stated above.  
     
      
    46 Secondly, I do not consider that the temporal connection between the two trials warrants the conclusion argued for on behalf of the accused. There is, I think it is clear, a temporal connection. But it is rather more remote at this stage than has been argued. My own present estimate is that there may be anywhere between three and six months before a jury will be empanelled in the present trial. This estimate is based, so far as one can make an estimate, upon the nature of the interlocutory applications I have seen thus far, but, even in the course of this week, I have seen those increase, or at least potentially increase, in a reasonably significant way. Thus, experience suggests it may be many months before anything that could be described as a potentially critical situation might arise.  
     
      
    47 I positively reject any suggestion that the publications that have occurred in the New South Wales media since the Melbourne trial began in mid February have, or could have, in any realistic sense, already ""indelibly poisoned"" the minds of potential jurors. Many months hence, fifteen jurors will be selected from a pool of perhaps eight or nine hundred citizens. The pool itself will be selected from a vast population area. The possibility that any of these fifteen jurors will or would recall, or will or would have paid much heed to, the material that has been published thus far is quite remote.  
     
      
    48 Moreover, by the time the present trial commences with the empanelment of the jury, the potential jurors may be quite uninterested in the reporting that will have occurred between now and the time of empanelment. There will be many thousands of media reports on all sorts of topics to divert, stimulate or interest people between then and now.  
     
      
    49 It is true that recent reporting has painted Mr Benbrika in a most unfavourable light. But there will be many other people painted in an unfavourable light in the media between now and the time of the empanelment of the jury. This will happen on every page of the newspapers. It will happen in many segments of the television news. It will happen on the media that is available and accessible over the Internet.  
     
      
    50 It is quite possible - indeed somewhat likely - that the reporting itself will not be as intense as the months go by as it has been for the last couple of weeks. I do not suggest that there will not be a degree of reporting of the Melbourne trial as the weeks and months pass, but it is, I think, unlikely to be at the level generated by the reporting of the opening of the Crown case by Mr Maidment in Melbourne.  
     
      
    51 So often one sees a situation where a Crown opening attracts considerable attention on the front or leading pages of the newspapers but, as the trial progresses, it dwindles towards the back pages. The reporting becomes less intense; the headlines become less sensational, and the like. Of course, I cannot foresee exactly what will happen in the present matter. I have no reason to suppose otherwise than there will be a lessening of publicity.  
     
      
    52 Further, the surnames of the Sydney accused will not be mentioned in the reporting of the Melbourne trial. To my way of thinking, this is a significant factor in relation to the arguments that have been addressed to me.  
     
      
    53 I would also add that, in any event, members of the jury pool will, at the outset of the selection process, be invited to seek exclusion from the panel if they feel, for any reason, that they are biased or cannot bring an impartial mind to the task, if they were to be selected as a jury member. This invitation will, so far as I am concerned, be expressed in quite pejorative and precise terms, so as to make it abundantly clear that any person who has a biased opinion about terrorism generally, any person who has a biased opinion about these accused men, or about any aspect of the trial, including the evidence that will be adduced in the trial, has no role whatsoever to play in the jury process. I will not hesitate to exclude any such person from participation in the jury selection process. This is not to be critical of such persons, because bias is something we all experience, as we do with prejudice. But it will be taken into account in that way at the very commencement of the trial.  
     
      
    54 The next matter I come to consider is that I am conscious that, in England especially, suppression orders, or more accurately postponement orders, have issued from time to time in what are described often as back to back trials.  
     
      
    55 Now, the position in the present matter is, to my mind, quite different from those situations. First, I do not accept the submission that, having regard to the anticipated evidence, any of the Melbourne accused, including their spiritual leader can be regarded as an un-indicted co-conspirator.  
     
      
    56 Secondly, I have earlier set out, and I repeat, that no member of the Sydney accused is, on the Crown case, a member of the Melbourne organisation. It is not suggested by the Crown that any member of the Sydney accused played any part in the Melbourne organisation's plan to advance the cause of jihad by bombing or explosive activity in that State; finally, it is not suggested that there is any joint conspiracy between the two groups to engage in a joint criminal enterprise involving violent jihad.  
     
      
    57 Thirdly, the evidence to be led in this trial of an association between any of the Sydney accused and Mr Benbrika, or for that matter any of the other Melbourne accused, is, in the main, evidence of intercepted calls and of a few meetings. The relevance of the evidence is, as I presently understand it, germane especially to the mental element of the alleged offence and proof of the terrorist nature of the preparatory actions by some of the Sydney accused.  
     
      
    58 I should mention that there is to be a challenge to the Melbourne evidence, both as to its relevance and as to its prejudicial effect. In relation to the latter aspect, the Court will be asked to exclude the evidence. But, assuming the evidence is admitted, the jury will be aware of no more than the content and nature of the relevant conversations. The relevance and scope of such material, if admitted, will be limited to the conversations, the terms of those conversations, and the meetings themselves. It is true that the jury may become apprised of Mr Benbrika's extremist views arising from that material, but that is all that they will know from the evidence in this trial. 
     
      
    59 May I divert my remarks to make one further comment. I do not know what the issues will be in this trial. We are nowhere near counsel informing me what those issues are. For all I know, it may become a relevant issue in this trial that the accused, or some of them, will wish to distance themselves from Mr Benbrika and from his views. They may wish to paint him in a bad way. I mention this merely to indicate how hypothetical, in some way, the present arguments are when they are divorced from the real issues in the trial, or they may be when the real issues in the trial are known. It may be that those issues are not even known to counsel at this stage. This is of course, merely speculation on my part; and it plays no part in my reasoning. It is simply a comment. 
     
      
    60 In any event, to return to the evidence itself, if it be admitted in the Sydney trial, this leads me to the final matter that persuades me that the relief should not be granted. This is the issue of the giving of directions to the jury. The experience of the Court has been that, even in the absence of specific directions, jurors bring a special integrity to their task and have a basic appreciation that they are concerned only with the evidence in the trial and not with other matters, even where those other matters may relate to publication of material in the media.  
     
      
    61 Secondly, it is the further experience of the Court that juries in the main do pay heed to specific directions given by the trial Judge. There is a great deal of authority now, which provides principal support for the anecdotal experience of individual judges. (Re: Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 603; Kanaan v R [2006] NSWCCA 109; John Fairfax Publications v District Court at 103; R v Lodhi [2007] NSWCCA 360 It is, of course, far too early to say what directions should be given to the jury in this matter, or when such directions should be given, especially in relation to publication that has occurred to date, or for that matter to publications which may occur between this date and the commencement of the Sydney trial, or after the trial has commenced. Throughout all these periods, the Court will be in a sound position to assess, reassess and monitor the situation from time to time over the next three to six months, or, indeed, if it be necessary, over the next twelve months.  
     
      
    62 For all these reasons, I propose to dismiss the summons and refuse the relief sought.  
     
      
    63 I do not consider that a temporary stay of proceedings is warranted, essentially for the same factual reasons. Having regard to the custodial situation of the accused, I think there is a very powerful incentive for the pre-trial submissions to proceed at, at least, a reasonable pace, in the expectation that the trial will commence and conclude within the time frame I have mentioned.  
     
      
    64 Although I propose to dismiss the summons, I would like, before I leave the matter, to make an exhortation to the media interests. I trust, in due course, Mr Blackburn will make these remarks available to his clients. It will be accepted, I imagine, that I have the outmost respect, as I must do, for the principles of open justice. Based on my own experience, I have also a high regard, generally speaking, for the capacity and ability of the media to report Court proceedings fairly and with integrity.  
     
      
    65 Although I have found against the plaintiffs in the present summons, it cannot be said that their concerns about the reporting of the Melbourne trial have been without foundation, or that they are baseless. A good example of those concerns is to be seen in the juxta position of the reporting of these proceedings and the Melbourne trial on the same page of the Daily Telegraph on Tuesday, February 26, 2008. Of course, those two articles were written by two different reporters, and I do not suggest that those individual reporters were responsible for the decision to place the two articles side-by-side on the one page. Somebody was responsible, however, and, whichever way one looks at it, it was an unfortunate situation and one which should be avoided in the future.  
     
      
    66 It may have happened purely coincidentally, but if it were a deliberate decision, it could be reasonably argued that the editorial intention was to link the two trials as one in the minds of readers. This is not a desirable or proper situation. As I have said, it is many months before a jury will be empanelled in the present matter and that factor of present temporal disconnection deprives the juxta position of the two articles of the sting, which might otherwise apply in this situation. The position, however, would not necessarily be the same were that to happen at the time, or close to the time, when a jury was to be empanelled in the Sydney trial. Similarly, the position might well be otherwise if that were to happen during the trial. 
     
      
    67 What I would wish to say to the media interests is this: they are now very much on notice that there is a concern, both about the temporal and factual link of these two trials. As presently I understand the position, and for the reasons I have given, those links do not, in my view, warrant the interference of the Court at this stage.  
     
      
    68 The position might well be otherwise if less than responsible decisions were to be made about the reporting of the Melbourne trial as we come closer and closer to the time when a jury is to be empanelled in the present trial. This extends not only to questions such as where articles appear in the paper or in media items generally; it extends as well to their content, to the inclusion of photographs of the Melbourne accused, and to the naming of names.  
     
      
    69 I would urge the media, particularly as the weeks and months pass, to bear in mind the need for restraint, integrity and caution in all these matters. The trial I am about to undertake will be one of the longest and largest trials to have taken place in Sydney. I doubt whether it is the longest and largest, but it is certainly in that category. It would be an absolute tragedy, for many reasons I need not enumerate here, to see the trial fall over because of ill-intentioned, neglectful or careless media standards. I do not suggest that this is likely to happen. Indeed, I am confident that the media will heed my warnings, cautions and recommendations, and, if they do, it will not happen. 
     
      
    70 The orders I propose to make are:  
     
      
       
      (1) I dismiss the summons.  
       
       
      (2) I dismiss the application for a stay. I will suppress the details of the present application, the arguments that surrounded it and, for the moment, suppress publication of the decision itself.  
       
       
      (3) I will direct, however, that the decision be shown by Senior Counsel for the media outlets to the outlets that he represents, reminding them at the same time, however, that the decision itself is not to be published at this point in time. This is essentially because we are at the commencement of pre-trial applications and much of the evidence to which I have referred will be under challenge.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant was presented for trial upon an indictment that pleaded two counts. 
     
      
    2 Count 1 was in terms that on or about 13 September 2003 at Croydon the applicant had sexual intercourse with J who was a person under the age of ten years, namely three years of age. This count alleged a contravention of s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900 and attracted a statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of 25 years. The offence carries a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  
     
      
    3 Count 2 was in terms that on or about 13 September 2003 at Croydon the applicant murdered J. This count alleged a contravention of s 18 of the Crimes Act 1900 and attracted a statutory maximum penalty of imprisonment of life imprisonment (s 19A). A standard non-parole period of 20 years applied to the offence. 
     
      
    4 The applicant pleaded guilty to count 1 and not guilty to count 2. Following a trial the applicant was acquitted of the charge of murder but found guilty of manslaughter. The offence of manslaughter carries a statutory maximum penalty of 25 years pursuant to s 24 of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced on count 1 to a fixed term of 14 years imprisonment commencing on 17 October 2015 and expiring on 16 October 2029. On count 2 he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 years and 9 months commencing on 17 October 2015 and expiring on 16 July 2034 with a balance of term of 6 years and 3 months commencing on 16 July 2034 and expiring on 16 October 2040. 
     
      
    6 At the time he was sentenced the applicant was serving a sentence for other offences. The aggregate non-parole period of the other sentences expired on 17 October 2015 which explains the commencement date of the sentences which his Honour imposed for the present offences. 
     
      
    7 The offences for which the applicant had already been sentenced related to the sexual assault by the applicant of the sister of the victim of the present offences. The sister was aged 6 and the offences occurred on the previous day to the present offences. For the other offences the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years and 1 month commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 17 October 2015. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    8 The Crown case was that in late 2002 the applicant met the mother of the victims J [the victim of the present offences] and B (his sister) in the vicinity of Croydon railway station. They became acquainted. Sometime in 2003 J’s mother remarked that she needed help looking after the children and the applicant offered to mind them. 
     
      
    9 An arrangement was made that the applicant would be paid $30 per day to look after the children. The children would stay at the applicant’s flat which he shared with Keith Coles. The children would visit their mother in the late afternoon after she returned from work but would then stay overnight at the applicant’s flat. 
     
      
    10 On 13 September 2003 the children returned to the applicant’s flat. At 12.09 am on 14 September 2003 the applicant telephoned 000. He said that a 3 year old boy was vomiting, had choked, was unconscious and was not breathing. The child had not responded to CPR or to what he described as a “little bit of an electric shock” that he had tried on the boy. 
     
      
    11 An ambulance arrived 7 minutes later. Paramedics described the child’s body as cool to the touch. The deceased was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where resuscitation was attempted without success. A post-mortem examination detected recent tears to the anus of the deceased and bruising to the lining of the rectum.  
     
      
    12 The Crown put its case in the alternative. The first alternative was that the deceased had vomited as a result of the pain of being sexually assaulted by the applicant and choked. The alternative was that the deceased was electrocuted when the applicant applied live electric wires to his body. The applicant did not give evidence at his trial. 
     
      
    13 When sentencing the applicant, his Honour found that death was occasioned by an unlawful and dangerous act by having anal intercourse with the deceased. His Honour accepted expert evidence to the effect that at the time that the applicant applied electrical wires to the deceased in an attempt to revive him he was already dead. His Honour did not find that the applicant intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim.  
     
      
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    14 The applicant was born on 27 October 1971 and was 34 when he was sentenced. The applicant had been a ward of the State from when he was 4 or 5 years old and never saw his parents again. A report from a neuropsychologist, Dr Langeluddecke, concluded that the applicant was in the “low average” or “borderline” levels of cognitive ability and placed him within the 4th percentile when compared with other persons of a similar age. 
     
      
    15 When interviewed by Dr Bruce Westmore the applicant gave a history of having been sexually and physically abused by his father from the ages of about 3 to 5. The applicant said he considered himself to be a paedophile in terms of his sexual orientation. 
     
      
       
      Criminal history 
       
      
    16 The applicant was convicted at Blacktown Local Court of two counts of inciting an act of indecency with a person under the age of 18, three counts of committing an act of gross indecency, and one count of sexual assault. The applicant was sentenced for these offences in 1990 and a supervised bond and a community service order were imposed. 
     
      
    17 In 1993 the applicant was convicted of having sexual intercourse with an intellectually impaired person. He was sentenced to a minimum term of 3 months and 21 days with an additional term of 18 months. 
     
      
    18 In 1997 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count of indecent assault of a child under the age of 10 years and one count of committing an act of indecency with a person under the age of 16. 
     
      
    19 The applicant has a number of other convictions which are not relevant to the present matters. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    20 There are 3 grounds of appeal. First, the applicant submitted that his Honour erred in the application of the principles of totality. It was further submitted that his Honour erred in not finding special circumstances permitting a variation in the proportion between the parole period and the non-parole period. The third ground of appeal is that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      The remarks of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    21 The sentencing judge was conscious of the fact that the applicant had already been sentenced for the sexual assault committed on the victim’s sister. The sentence for that offence was imposed in the District Court on 21 October 2004. The applicant was sentenced for the present offences on 11 August 2006. His Honour noted that the sentences which had been imposed in the District Court provided that the applicant would not be eligible for parole until 17 October 2015. He had been sentenced to a total term of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years and 1 month for those offences. 
     
      
    22 At an early point in his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge noted that it was “a matter of significance” that the applicant was presently subject to these sentences. Shortly thereafter his Honour noted that it would be “necessary to pay attention to the (sentences in respect of the victim B) in terms of your ultimate total sentence.” 
     
      
    23 His Honour was clearly mindful of the need for an appropriate relationship between the sentences imposed for the prior offence and the offence for which his Honour was sentencing. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are, however, other matters which must be considered including the penalty for the offence for aggravated sexual assault itself, whether a non parole period should be specified and whether there should be cumulation or concurrency with the sentences which you have already received for the offences committed on B.” 
        
       
      
    24 His Honour concluded that the act of causing death “by a forced act of anal penetration upon a small child, whilst this act was not accompanied by an intention to cause serious injury but was accompanied by an intention to gratify a depraved sexual urge, falls within the category of a worst case of manslaughter.” His Honour identified the fact that the applicant was a self acknowledged paedophile and concluded that he was “in the class of the worst offenders.” His Honour indicated that he reached this conclusion after giving appropriate weight to subjective matters. His Honour was also mindful that although the applicant must be separately and appropriately punished for the crime of aggravated sexual assault upon B he must not be doubly punished for his criminal behaviour. Accordingly, his Honour determined to make the sentences for the aggravated sexual assault concurrent with the sentence for manslaughter. 
     
      
    25 His Honour imposed a sentence of 16 years imprisonment reduced to 14 years to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea in relation to the charge for the sexual assault of J. His Honour did not set a non-parole period because he determined that the sentence should be subsumed by the sentence in respect of the manslaughter charge.  
     
      
    26 His Honour considered the submission that the offences against B and J should be considered as the one episode of criminality. It was submitted that this was an appropriate approach having regard to the fact that the offences occurred within a relatively short time of each other. His Honour said of this submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a sense, that is true but they could only fit the description of a single manifestation of criminality because both children were placed in your care as a result of the one arrangement with their mother. Each child was a separate victim and what you did to B was not allied to what you did to J in any relevant sense. I have read the Judge’s remarks on sentence relating to B as victim and they can be referred to for observing the basis for that conclusion.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour expressly acknowledged the need to consider questions of overall totality and concluded that having regard to the enormity of the applicant’s crime it was appropriate to “cumulate the sentences for the offences in which J was the victim upon the sentences which you have already received for the offences in which B was the victim.” 
     
      
    28 Finally, his Honour considered the question of special circumstances. His Honour did not believe that special circumstances existed and decided to set a non-parole period for the manslaughter offence in accordance with the statutory formula. His Honour anticipated that if the applicant was released to parole he would be subject to stringent conditions and supervision to ensure the safety of the community. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    29 The applicant emphasised that as a result of the combination of the sentence imposed in the District Court and that imposed in the present matter the combined sentence was a head sentence of 37 years and 1 month commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 16 October 2040. The total non-parole period was a period of 30 years 10 months commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 16 July 2034. It was submitted that a sentence of this length was excessive and failed to acknowledge the recognised principles of totality when an offender is being sentenced for a number of offences. The aggregate sentence must be “just and appropriate” which may require amelioration of the individual sentences: see Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-3. 
     
      
    30 It was submitted that because the offences were committed in a short space of time there should have been some degree of concurrency. Although it was accepted that there were separate victims and the offences were of a significantly different character it was nevertheless submitted that some degree of concurrency was appropriate. 
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that there was no relevant error. His Honour gave careful consideration to questions of concurrency and accumulation and determined to provide that the sentence for the aggravated sexual assault should be made wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed for manslaughter. Having made this decision his Honour determined to cumulate the former upon the latter having regard to the totality of the criminality for which the applicant was to be sentenced. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    32 The sentencing of an offender for multiple offences can cause difficulties. Although mindful of the need to impose an appropriate punishment for the individual offences, the Court must ensure that the overall sentence remains appropriate having regard to the totality of the offending. The relevant principles were recently considered by this Court in R v MMK (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 and R v Cahyadi (2007) 168 A Crim R 41.  
     
      
    33 In R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260; (1983) 13 A Crim R 375 at 389, Street CJ described the principle in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The principle of totality is a convenient phrase, descriptive of the significant practical consideration confronting a sentencing Judge when sentencing for two or more offences. Not infrequently a straightforward arithmetical addition of sentences appropriate for each individual offence considered separately will arrive at an ultimate aggregate that exceeds what is called for in the whole of the circumstances. In such a situation the sentencing Judge will evaluate, in a broad sense, the overall criminality involved in all of the offences and, having done so, will determine what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary, whether by telescoping or otherwise, in the aggregate sentences in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences …” 
        
       
      
    34 In R v Cahyadi Howie J (with whom Price J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.” (at [27]) 
        
       
      
    35 In the present case, although the overall sentence is lengthy, I am satisfied that his Honour’s decision to cumulate the sentence for manslaughter on the sentence imposed in the District Court was within his Honour’s sentencing discretion. The overall result is a significant term of imprisonment but in my view, having regard to the enormity of the applicant’s crimes, within the appropriate sentencing range. Although committed on successive days, the offences were discrete acts of criminality committed on separate victims. Although each victim was the subject of acts of sexual assault his Honour accommodated these offences by making the sentence for the sexual assault of J wholly concurrent with the sentence for his manslaughter. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    36 His Honour was not persuaded that there were special circumstances which justified a variation in the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the period on parole for the manslaughter offence. The applicant submitted that as a consequence of the accumulation of the sentence imposed in the Supreme Court with that imposed in the District Court the total non-parole period was a disproportionate proportion of the total head sentence. The applicant emphasised that because of the manner in which the sentences were structured the applicant had been sentenced to an overall non-parole period of 30 years and 10 months with a parole period of 6 years and 3 months giving a total head sentence of 37 years and 1 month. The proportion which the overall non-parole period bears to the overall head sentence is 83.1%. 
     
      
    37 It was submitted that his Honour had not considered the question of whether the effect of accumulation of the sentences itself produced special circumstances calling for a variation in the proportion between the parole period and the head sentence pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    38 There are many cases in which this Court has recognised that the fact that sentences are made cumulative one upon the other may constitute special circumstances justifying a departure from the “one-third” rule in relation to an individual sentence (see Close v Regina (1992) 65 A Crim R 55; Simpson v Regina (1992) 61 A Crim R 58; R v Ibrahim [2005] NSWCCA 43; Qing An v R [2007] NSWCCA 53 at [107]-[113]) 
     
      
    39 Although his Honour considered the question of special circumstances in relation to count 2 it does not appear that he considered whether the decision to cumulate the District Court and Supreme Court sentences gave rise to a need to consider special circumstances having regard to the overall ratios. It would seem that the matter may not have been drawn to his attention. I am satisfied that consideration should have been given to this issue. It is apparent that the applicant will require both appropriate treatment and a significant period of supervision following his return into the community if he is ever to become a stable and law abiding member of society. I can see no reason to provide a period on parole shorter than the statutory ratio for his total sentence. If consideration had been given to this question in my view a finding of special circumstances was appropriate. 
     
      
    40 It is plain that with the enactment of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 different considerations now arise in relation to the release of an offender at the end of his overall prison term. I am also aware of treatment programs which are provided for sexual offenders and the strict conditions imposed on them if they are released on parole. A variation of the non-parole period in the present case may have no consequence, for unless the appropriate authorities are completely satisfied that it is appropriate the applicant will not be released to parole. Furthermore, unless they are satisfied that it is appropriate for him ultimately to be released into the community the Attorney-General may make an application to this Court to extend the period of the applicant’s incarceration beyond the total term of his sentence. By varying the non-parole period in the manner I contemplate an opportunity will be provided at an earlier date to consider whether the applicant should be released to parole. Only if his progress has been satisfactory will this occur. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    41 The applicant also submitted that the overall sentence imposed in effect the sentence for count 2 was manifestly excessive. His counsel drew attention to a number of decisions. In Regina v Guider [2002] NSWSC 756 the offender pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of a nine year old girl, Samantha Knight. The offender had taken the deceased to an undisclosed location and given her Normison with the assumed intention of taking indecent photographs of her. However, the child stopped breathing and died. At the time he was sentenced Guider was nearly 52 years old having been 36 years of age when the offence was committed. At the time he was sentenced he was serving lengthy sentences for child sexual assault and there was evidence that he was a paedophile. Wood CJ at CL sentenced Guider to 17 years with a non-parole period of 12 years. The sentences were made partly concurrent with sentences which Guider was already serving. 
     
      
    42 In Regina v Hoerler (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 the offender pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of a 7 month old baby, the son of his de facto. A post mortem examination showed that the child had been struck in the jaw with very considerable force and a number of ribs had been fractured. The victim’s toes had been crushed by the use of a clamp. The offender had prior offences of violence on his record. He was sentenced to 11 years with a non-parole period of 8 years and 3 months. However, a Crown appeal was allowed and Hoerler was resentenced to 14 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 10 years 9 months. It must be assumed that the sentence which this Court imposed was at the bottom of the appropriate range. Accordingly, a more significant sentence may have been appropriate when sentencing at first instance. 
     
      
    43 In Regina v Adamson (2002) 132 A Crim R 511 the offender pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter and two counts of aggravated sexual assault. Adamson had anally and vaginally sexually penetrated the victim at a party. While doing so he had placed his hand over the victim’s mouth and blocked her nose to prevent her calling out. This caused asphyxiation and death. Adamson was 19 years old and had prior convictions for malicious wounding and supplying a prohibited drug. He was sentenced to 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months. His appeal against sentence was dismissed. 
     
      
    44 The applicant also draws attention to the Judicial Commission statistics for the offence of manslaughter between April 2000 and March 2007. Of the 187 offenders, 172 received full time custodial sentences. The head sentence of 25 years, being the maximum imposed on the applicant in the present case has not been imposed in any other case. The next highest head sentence was 18 years, which was imposed on 3 offenders. The applicant emphasised that from these figures it is apparent that he has received the highest head sentence during this period by 7 years.  
     
      
    45 The applicant submitted that the statistics also reveal that the applicant has received the highest non-parole period of anyone sentenced for manslaughter during this period. The next highest non-parole period revealed by the statistics are two sentences each of 12 years. These were probably the sentences imposed on Hoerler and Adamson. 
     
      
    46 Accordingly, the applicant submitted that the non-parole period imposed on him was more than double that imposed on all other persons (apart from Hoerler and Adamson) imprisoned for manslaughter. It was submitted that a comparison of the objective gravity of the present case with that of Hoerler and Adamson would not suggest that a non-parole period twice as great was called for in the present case. 
     
      
    47 This Court has drawn attention on many occasions to the difficulties of sentencing for manslaughter. In R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 Spigelman CJ discussed the difficulties in identifying a sentencing trend or pattern for manslaughter, for which “the permissible sentencing range for manslaughter must be regarded as particularly wide” (at [141]). In relation to manslaughter itself, his Honour said at [133]-[134]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Blacklidge 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, esp pp2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( 
        R v Weinman 
         (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252;  
        R v Hoerler 
         (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]). 
        
       
       
        
        It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation  
        within  
        any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter.” 
        
       
      
    48 In the present case I am satisfied that his Honour was correct in finding that the offence was in the worst class of manslaughter. The abuse of a 3 year old child for sexual gratification by anal penetration resulting in death is a crime of the utmost gravity. Furthermore, the subjective circumstances of the applicant did not justify any amelioration of the sentence. In my opinion the sentence which his Honour imposed for count 2 was within his Honour’s discretion. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    49 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the applicant has made good ground 2 of the appeal but fails on grounds 1 and 3. The non-parole period in relation to the manslaughter offence should be varied so that the statutory ratio for the totality of his sentences is maintained. This would have the consequence that the non-parole period for the manslaughter offence would be reduced to a term of 15 years and 9 months. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
      2. Uphold the appeal in relation to the sentence for count 2. In relation to that count impose a non-parole period for a term of 15 years and 9 months but otherwise confirm the sentence. 
       
      3. Otherwise dismiss the appeal. 
       
      4. As a consequence of order 2 the applicant will be eligible for parole on 16 July 2031.

    JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing Peter Geoffrey Rae for five crimes. (See discussion following [46].) One of the issues is the extent to which I take into account sentencing patterns of the courts at the time that these offences were committed which was in the 1980s.  
    2. Mr Rae has pleaded guilty to the five crimes. Two of them are the crime of buggery contrary to s 79 of the Crimes Act 1900. Each carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. 
    3. The third charge is an indecent assault on a male and that is a crime against s 81 of the Crimes Act and carries with it a maximum of five years imprisonment. 
    4. The fourth charge is an indecent assault charge and that is an offence under s 61E of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of six years imprisonment. 
    5. When I am sentencing Mr Rae for one of the crimes of buggery he has asked me to take into account under s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 five additional offences. One of those offences is an indecent assault contrary to s 61E of the Crimes Act and a second is a sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61D(1) of the Crimes Act. A third is inciting a person under sixteen to an act of indecency contrary to s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act. The fourth is an offence described in similar terms. The fifth is a sexual assault and committing an act of indecency contrary to s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act.  
    6. The offences occurred over the years from 1980 until 1985 and involved two victims. Both were young men. In fact one of the young men was a boy when he first became the victim of an offence by Mr Rae.  
    7. The first victim’s name is X. He was between the ages of eight and thirteen at the time of the offences. Mr Rae was a frequent visitor to the rural property where X lived with his mother and his family. His mother and the offender shared a devotion to the teachings of Sai Baba, an Indian guru. Through that connection Mr Rae became familiar with the family. Mr Rae moved into a property next to the property where X lived. Mr Rae spent a lot of the summer months on the property. In the winter months Mr Rae was employed at Thredbo. 
    8. The first offence occurred, or at least I should say the first in time, which was the indecent assault against a male contrary to s 81 of the Crimes Act, in 1980. It was winter. X was eight. He went with his family to spend time at the snow. He stayed with Mr Rae. Mr Rae had lodgings at Thredbo where he was employed. One evening during the stay X’s mother and brother were otherwise occupied. Mr Rae asked X to come to his bedroom. They sat on the floor opposite each other. Mr Rae exposed his erect penis and commenced to masturbate himself in front of X. He said to X, “Can you rub me” and took hold of X’s hand placing it on his penis and made X masturbate him for a period of time. He encouraged X. That is the first offence. 
    9. This offence was not an isolated example. Not only was there another offence committed against X in respect of which I will sentence Mr Rae but it is important to appreciate that those two offences were in the context of other offending. I am not sentencing Mr Rae for those other offences but it is important to refer to them in order to avoid any conclusion that these were isolated examples. 
    10. The facts agreed to by Mr Rae are that over the next five years from 1980 Mr Rae continued to touch X on the penis. He would also ask X to masturbate him and show him pornographic material. The estimate is that this occurred at least thirty times. 
    11. Moving on in order of time, the next offences occurred in winter of 1983. They are two of the offences which are on the Form 1. They are the indecent assault at Crackenback and the sexual intercourse without consent at Crackenback between 1 May 1983 and 31 October 1983. As I said it was winter of 1983. X was eleven. Mr Rae had invited him and another boy to stay with him at his ski lodge. X shared an upstairs bedroom with Mr Rae. Each had their own single bed and the other boy slept downstairs. Late one evening X and Mr Rae were alone upstairs. Mr Rae produced a pornographic magazine and started to masturbate in front of X. He asked X to comment on the material. Mr Rae removed X’s trousers and underwear and masturbated him for a period of time. That constituted the indecent assault, however, matters became far worse on that occasion. After a while Mr Rae turned X around so that X had his back to him. Despite X saying, “Don’t put your dick up my bum” X felt a stabbing internal pain in his anus either from Mr Rae’s finger or penis. Mr Rae had proceeded against the protestations of this eleven year old boy to penetrate his anus. It continued for a short period of time. 
    12. The next offence in time is the fourth count for which I am sentencing Mr Rae. It is the indecent assault against s 61E of the Crimes Act. It occurred in the summer of 1985. By now X was thirteen. He had gone camping with Mr Rae to Salt Water Creek south of Eden. During the journey Mr Rae allowed X to drive his car and also shared marihuana with him. Later that night when they were sleeping in the same tent X woke up to find that Mr Rae had hold of his, X’s, penis and was masturbating him. That was the final assault on X. 
    13. X did not tell anyone about Mr Rae’s abusive behaviour until about 1986 when he told his mother. His mother confronted Mr Rae. Mr Rae did not deny it. X did not report the offences to any authorities until October 2005. 
    14. The other offences concern another victim. His name is Y. He lived on a rural property not far from X’s place and presumably Mr Rae’s place. He and his brother became friendly with the X brothers. Y stayed on at least one occasion at the ski lodge in Thredbo. Y was the victim of the two offences of buggery. They both occurred in the summer months of 1983. On the first occasion in summer 1983 Mr Rae took Y, then aged about thirteen or fourteen, to a beach in the Eden area. They went to the sand dunes. Y was dressed in board shorts. He was lying face down on his towel. Mr Rae commenced to rub lotion on his back, then he removed Y’s board shorts and lay on top of him. He penetrated Y’s anus with his penis and moved it in and out for about ten minutes.  
    15. The second offence of buggery occurred over the same summer. It was about a month later. Mr Rae invited Y to go to the movies at Eden. He picked him up in his car but instead of going to the movies they ended up returning to Mr Rae’s property. They parked in the driveway. Mr Rae asked Y to take off the pants he was wearing then he arranged for Y to bed over a small partition between the front and back seats of the car whilst he, Mr Rae, had anal intercourse with him. 
    16. After that incident Y had no further contact with Mr Rae. He did not report the matter until 1987 after he had heard that X had made a complaint to the police about the offender. 
    17. The evidence in this case includes a victim impact statement from X. It is a very articulate document and in my opinion encapsulates in lay terms and from the point of view of a victim the kind of impact on the life of a young person which abuse of this kind from an adult can have over a sustained period of time in the life of that victim. 
    18. Mr X says that his sexual abuse “has left an internal wound that is for me very difficult to identify and describe, despite more than two decades of trying.” When he examines this aspect of life it brings pain which he is desperate to avoid. He has spoken to many others about his experiences. He does not know how to get rid of the awful feelings which rise up when he thinks about or talks about what Mr Rae did to him. He describes himself as a young boy naturally highly driven, competitive and successful at both sport and school. He then observes that he can “see now that this drive had faded considerably after five years of sexual abuse. Although I have had some academic success, I can see now that I have never regained the energy and determination to succeed that I originally possessed.” 
    19. Mr X is now thirty-five years old. He says that his personal life has been characterised by an inability to commit. He has had many relationships as an adult. He has been married and divorced. He usually finds himself becoming gradually distant from his partner. Understandably he is concerned that his desire to establish a stable long term relationship and to have a family may never be realised. In a fairly balanced observation Mr X says that it is “impossible to know to what extent this may have been different had I not been abused. I can only state what has occurred, and say that I believe they maybe connected.” 
    20. Mr X describes Mr Rae as exploiting him, betraying his trust and the trust which the family placed in Mr Rae. He said that the abuse has damaged him in a manner that runs very deep and he thinks it is impossible to completely overcome. He said that he considered Peter Rae his friend. He said he thought he loved and cared for him and put his best interests first. He said he thought Mr Rae liked him for who he was and had time for him and gave him attention based on his assessment of him as a person. Mr X then observes that after twenty years he has gradually come to realise that this was not true. He observes, correctly in my opinion, that the relationship between him and Mr Rae was corrupt. Mr Rae, he says, was motivated by his wish to sexually exploit him. He was groomed for this exploitation. He says that Mr Rae put his desire for sexual gratification before Mr X’s need not to be raped. Mr X said he tried to stop him. He told him not to put his penis into his bottom but he ignored his plea and penetrated him. He had many opportunities to stop abusing him but he never did. It only stopped when he was old enough to resist. I observe that in that regard that the incident referred to there about penetration of his anus is one of the offences which I have taken into account rather than an offence for which I am sentencing Mr Rae.  
    21. Mr X says that he still carries strong feelings of fear and powerlessness with an overwhelming emotion of sadness. He observes that trust is the most important element for him in any relationship and Mr Rae betrayed that trust as well as deceiving his family.  
    22. The authorities state that there is no need for evidence of the fact that sexual abuse of children results in damage. This statement by Mr X is, as I said, one which comes from a layman. It is not from a psychologist or a psychiatrist but it is from a victim of this kind of offending behaviour. I adopt the moderate terms used by Mr X when he says that it is impossible to know to what extent his life may have been different but it is clear that his life to date has been seriously and significantly damaged by the behaviour which Mr Rae inflicted upon him. This statement illustrates, in my opinion, graphically the kind of impact which this kind of abusive behaviour by adults can have on the life of their victims. 
    23. Understandably and correctly in my opinion, Mr Hoenig who appears for Mr Rae agreed that the emotional harm resulting from his client’s offending behaviour so far as Mr X was concerned was clearly substantial.  
    24. In addition to that emotional harm which I take into account as an aggravating feature under s 21A subsection (2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I take into account as an aggravating feature that Mr Rae clearly abused his position of trust so far as both children were concerned. 
    25. I need to make some assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the four offences in respect of which I am sentencing Mr Rae. Mr Stanley, who appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions, submitted that the acts of buggery were in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Mr Hoenig whilst acknowledging the seriousness of the offender’s behaviour submitted that they are at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness. I accept Mr Hoenig’s submission in this regard. At the time of listening to the submissions I was inclined to accept Mr Stanley’s proposition. However, Mr Hoenig has made available to me a series of cases which are decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal from the 1970s and 1980s concerning, amongst other things, the crime of buggery. Some of the offences described in those cases are far more serious than these two isolated instances of penetration by Mr Rae of Mr Y’s anus. Some of the cases for example, involved offenders picking up hitchhikers threatening them with knives or guns and anally raping them in the back of a panel van. Another case involved a group of men sexually assaulting by way of buggery a man whilst he was in custody in a cell. Hence I regard the two offences of buggery committed by Mr Rae as in the lower end of the scale of objective seriousness.  
    26. I regard the indecent assault on X aged eight as also in the lower end of the range of objective seriousness. It was not accompanied by any violence or threats although a serious factor was the age of Mr X being eight at the time.  
    27. So too in the same range is the indecent assault committed on X when he was thirteen, although an aggravating feature - I withdraw that. I was going to say an aggravating feature was the smoking of the marijuana but that occurred earlier in the day and did not occur at the same time as the offence. Both were instances of the offender either masturbating the victim or the victim masturbating him on isolated occasions. They are very serious offences but remain, in my opinion, in the lower end of the range of objective seriousness. 
    28. I turn now to Mr Rae’s personal circumstances. They are set out conveniently in exhibit 1 which is a report from a very experienced consultant psychiatrist, Dr Lester Walton, dated 22 January 2008. Mr Rae was born on 30 November 1938 so that he has turned sixty-nine a few months ago. His father died early, that is when Mr Rae was a teenager. His mother was described as an alcoholic who died some thirty years ago. He was not aware of any history of mental disturbance within the family. He has worked intermittently self-employed as a photographer and a lift operator at Thredbo. He is now described as an aged pensioner.  
    29. As I said he developed an interest in a spiritual guru in India. That interest developed in 1973. He has visited and spent considerable time in India. He has had reasonably good health until some melanomas were removed some years ago and in 1996 he was diagnosed with bowel cancer. A CT scan in 2007 revealed lesions effecting his liver, possibly secondary cancers, although the psychiatrist thought that they were more likely to be benign blood vessel growths. He has a couple of other general medical conditions which may well be associated with his age. 
    30. I take into account the following factors as relevant to his personal circumstances and, where relevant, as factors in mitigation. He will turn seventy this year. That does not mitigate the seriousness of the offences but it is a factor which I take into account because his time in prison will be much harder for him at that age. I take into account the recent diagnosis of bowel cancer and the possible secondaries. I take into account that he has pleaded guilty and I propose to allow him, as agreed by Mr Stanley, a full discount of twenty-five percent from the sentences which I propose to impose because of what the law describes as the utilitarian value of those pleas. That means that he has spared the public court system considerable time which would have been taken up in conducting a prosecution for these offences. He has also spared his victims the necessity of confronting a judge and jury and giving an account of what had occurred. 
    31. He has expressed his shame to the psychiatrist, Dr Walton, but he has not elected to do that under oath or affirmation from the witness box. He has what Dr Walton described as somewhat underdeveloped remorse but the doctor acknowledges that is not uncommon with people who have committed these kinds of offences because of the difficulty in confronting, as a psychological exercise, the behaviour which they engaged in. I accept that that may also account, as Dr Walton thinks, for Mr Rae’s difficulty in recalling details of his abusing behaviour. 
    32. I accept Dr Walton’s opinion about his risk of re-offending. I regard Dr Walton as more qualified to express an opinion on that topic than the community corrections officer from the Ringwood Community Corrections Services who expressed in a report included in exhibit A that Mr Rae was at high risk of re-offending. I prefer, based on his experience and qualifications, the opinion of Dr Walton that he is not a high risk of re-offending but that there is some persisting risk and therefore the sex offenders programme if available in custody would be prudent. 
    33. I will take into account Mr Rae’s limited expression of remorse as one of the general subjective features. 
    34. I have been provided with material and authorities on the question of how I approach this sentencing exercise given the fact that the offences occurred so long ago. I follow the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in The Queen v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 and take into account the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of these offences because the sentencing practice has moved adversely to an offender since then. I have also taken into account the sentencing statistics produced by the New South Wales the Judicial Commission in fixing the sentences which I will impose.  
    35. The sentencing practices for the offences of buggery and indecent assault on a male and indecent assault are not readily ascertainable but I have gained some assistance from a number of decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal provided for me by Mr Hoenig which date from 1970s and 1980s. I have attempted, in fixing the sentences which I am due to impose on Mr Rae, to take into account the kinds of sentences which were imposed in those days.  
    36. I also take into account that I am sentencing Mr Rae many years after the commission of the offences but that is because he has not elected to confess his behaviour and the victims have not elected to bring the matter to the authorities. I do not hold that against Mr Rae at all but I do not regard that significant delay as particularly relevant to this case. In particular I accept Mr Stanley’s submission that there has not been demonstrated in this case any agony of mind which Mr Rae underwent over that period of time.  
    37. I turn now to the sentences which I will impose. I propose to sentence Mr Rae first for the indecent assault committed in 1985 on X when he was thirteen and then for the indecent assault against a male committed by Mr Rae against X when he was aged eight.  
    38. Just before moving to that stage I observe that Mr Rae had at the time of these offences no criminal record. Since these offences he was evidently charged in Queensland with indecent dealing with a child under twelve but no conviction was recorded and he was released on a recognizance. The following year he was arraigned in a Melbourne Magistrates Court charged with indecent assault and rape as well as gross indecency with a person under sixteen. He was convicted but the proceedings were adjourned for twelve months; there is a notation that at least one or more of those charges was withdrawn but it is difficult to determine which. I do not take those matters into account adversely to Mr Rae.  
    39. If you would stand up Mr Rae. I am going to sentence you now Mr Rae. For the indecent assault on X, again s 61E(1) of the Crimes Act, I had fixed a penalty of eighteen months with a non-parole period of twelve months, but because of your plea of guilty I have reduced that roughly by twenty-five percent, as it turns out more like thirty percent, to a sentence of twelve months with a non-parole period of nine months. That sentence of twelve months will commence when you went into custody on 6 February 2008 earlier this month at Bega and the non-parole period of nine months will expire on 5 November 2008. The balance of the term is three months from 6 November 2008 to 5 February 2009. 
    40. For the indecent assault on X, an offence against s 81 of the Crimes Act, I was going to sentence you for twelve months with an eight month non-parole period but instead because of your plea of guilty I will sentence you to nine months with a non-parole period of six months. That non-parole period will commence at the conclusion of the non-parole period for the first offence that is, it will commence on 6 November 2008. It will expire on 5 May 2009. The balance of the term for that sentence is three months commencing on 6 May 2009 and expiring on 5 August 2009. 
    41. I have decided to accumulate, that is to make consecutive, those two sentences. That is because although they were committed against the same victim they were committed some five years apart. They represent two quite different and distinct instances of offending behaviour against this victim. 
    42. I turn now to the first of the buggery offences committed against Y. These are offences against s 79 of the Crimes Act. The offence for which I am sentencing you now for is the one which was committed in the car and I was going to sentence you to four years with a non-parole period of two years but because of your plea of guilty I have discounted that by twenty-five percent and I propose to sentence you for three years with a non-parole of eighteen months. That non-parole period will commence on 6 May 2009 that is at the expiry of the non-parole period for the previous sentence and that non-parole period of eighteen months will expire on 5 November 2010. The balance of the term is eighteen months commencing 6 November 2010 and expiring on 5 May 2012. 
    43. I have made that sentence cumulative, that is consecutive, on the previous two penalties because they represent a completely different episode of criminal behaviour committed against a different victim. 
    44. Finally I turn to the offence of buggery committed against Y in the sand dunes over the summer of 1983 to 1984. In respect of that offence I take into account all of the offences which you have asked me to take into account which are on the Form 1. I had intended to fix a penalty of five years with a non-parole period of two and a half years but because of your plea of guilty I discount that by twenty-five percent or a little more as it turns out, and I discount it to three and a half years with a non-parole period of twenty-one months. That penalty will be concurrent, that is, run at the same time as the penalty for the previous offence. That is because both offences were committed about a month apart and against the same victim although not part of the criminal episode. I am, because of the accumulation of the previous sentences, inclined to make these two penalties concurrent. Hence the penalty for this offence will be a non-parole period of twenty-one months which commences on 6 May 2009 and expires on 5 February 2011. The balance of the term is twenty-one months commencing on 6 February 2011 and expiring on 5 November 2012. 
    45. I inform you that the earliest date for your release from custody Mr Rae is 5 February 2011 that is just under three years from now and I should say that is the earliest date for which you will be eligible for release. Whether or not you are released will depend upon the Parole Authority at the time.  
    46. Have a seat Mr Rae while I check with Mr Stanley and Mr Hoenig as to firstly whether the calculations work out and secondly, whether there are any other orders which I ought to make.HOENIG: No your Honour I think everything is fine.STANLEY: Yes your Honour. The only thing I’d like to say your Honour at the commencement of your judgment you indicated that you were sentencing him for five offences, it was probably a slip of the tongue.HIS HONOUR: It was. I’m sentencing Mr Rae for four offences, two offences of buggery contrary to s 79 of the Crimes Act, one offence of indecent assault on a male contrary to s 81 of the Crimes Act, one offence of indecent assault contrary to s 61E of the Crimes Act.STANLEY: Yes that’s right your Honour.HIS HONOUR: The exhibits and the MFIs I will return to my associate to be placed with the file. Can I thank you both for your assistance with this sentence. It has not been straight forward and I’ve had assistance from you both in Bega and since then with your submissions and the material which you have made available to me.

      2007 / 1954 R v GABOR ZIHA 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Following a trial by jury the offender, Gabor Ziha, was found guilty of the murder of Barry Corbett and of maliciously wounding Marija Ziha. For reasons which will appear, I shall refer to Marija Ziha as Mrs Corbett.  
     
      
    2 The offender and Mrs Corbett were husband and wife. They met in the former Yugoslav Republic when they were both teenagers. They lived not far from the Hungarian border and regarded themselves as Hungarian. Hungarian was their preferred language. They went to university and married there. Mrs Corbett was a linguist and interpreter in a number of languages. The offender was an electronics engineer. They have two children, a daughter, born in 1981 and a son, born in 1985. The family migrated to Australia in 1989 and in 2005 they were living at Baulkham Hills.  
     
      
    3 By that time relations between the offender and Mrs Corbett had been strained for a number of years. The offender was dedicated to and good at his job in the television industry. He did not generally seek the company of others and was described as a loner. There was only one person he could call a friend. Over the years the offender and Mrs Corbett had had their differences. The offender had an explosive temper, was described as having a “short fuse”, and had struck Mrs Corbett on a couple of occasions, though it would not be correct to say that he was habitually violent towards her. For some time he had had an intense interest in the origins of the Hungarian language and considered that the orthodox teaching on the subject was mistaken. He devoted a substantial part of his leisure time to the study of the subject and Mrs Corbett considered his study obsessive and misdirected. It became a further source of dissension between them. In March 2005 the offender reacted badly to the news of the death of his mother and was suffering symptoms of what was later diagnosed as depression. Things became so bad that Mrs Corbett resorted to trying to communicate with him by letter. By June 2005 she was threatening to leave him, though she did not then do so.  
     
      
    4 The offender had a rigid attitude to morals, particularly in sexual matters. He became convinced that their daughter was gaining computer access to a pornographic website, and it was impossible to persuade him that he was mistaken.  
     
      
    5 In December 2005 the offender attempted to commit suicide by cutting his wrist. He was taken to hospital and, for the first time, diagnosed as suffering from depression. His condition was not apparently serious enough to warrant his being kept in hospital for any long time, however, and he was soon discharged. He refused all offers of medical help after his discharge.  
     
      
    6 Mrs Corbett moved out of the house at Baulkham Hills shortly after Christmas 2005 and began living in a flat in Stewart Street Parramatta. The offender and the children remained at Baulkham Hills. Mrs Corbett kept in contact with the offender by email and telephone. She also visited the family at the Baulkham Hills house, not least to maintain contact with the children. She had met a man called Barry Corbett and continued to see him. Their friendship grew. The offender never met Mr Corbett but he learned about his existence.  
     
      
    7 At Mrs Corbett’s invitation, the offender visited her at Stewart Street to perform a small task. On that occasion she showed him the flat, but he was prevented from seeing the bedroom. He developed a strong desire to see it. 
     
      
    8 The offender began to say dark things about the relationship between Mrs Corbett and Mr Corbett. He began sending SMS messages to Mrs Corbett, asking her why she was doing this to him and saying that he knew that someone was with her. He observed that in some countries the penalty for adultery was stoning. At Easter he added to a card that had been received the words “the bible says she should be stoned to death”. He said that Australia was a stupid country because here if you stole bread you were sent to prison but if you stole another man’s woman it is okay under this culture. He repeatedly said that he had plans, that he had to do what he had to do, that he would be in the news, that it would be Mrs Corbett’s fault and that it was his destiny. He also said things that suggested that he was still thinking about committing suicide. 
     
      
    9 He found that Mr Corbett lived at an address in Darling Point. He went there and noticed Mrs Corbett’s car, parked in the street. He made remarks to the children that Mrs Corbett had left him to have “hot sex”. He said that Mr Corbett was rich and had a “big dick”. He told his son that he had seen Mrs Corbett and Mr Corbett having sexual intercourse, though it seems unlikely that he had done so, and I think that he was probably describing what he had imagined seeing. He said that he knew the car that Mr Corbett drove.  
     
      
    10 He knew that their son had a set of keys to the Stewart Street flat. He stole the keys and secretly had them copied. He visited the Stewart Street flat, uninvited while Mrs Corbett was away, and entered it, using the keys. He looked into the bedroom, the subject of his principal curiosity, and into the bedside drawers. He noticed there a Cosmopolitan magazine. He looked at it. He considered that it contained pornographic material.  
     
      
    11 On 1 August 2006, on the eve of the offender and Mrs Corbett’s wedding anniversary, Mrs Corbett was at the flat in Stewart Street and Mr Corbett was visiting. They went to bed and turned off the lights. The offender was at home at Baulkham Hills. He told his children that he was going to buy petrol and food for the dog and drove away from the house. After buying petrol he drove to the flat at Stewart Street. He noticed Mrs Corbett’s car parked in the street and Mr Corbett’s parked in Mrs Corbett’s usual position. He walked along the side of the building, looking to see any sign of lights or television. He saw that the flat was in darkness. He had in the car a work bag containing a kitchen knife, which he used at work, gloves, a torch and the keys to the flat. He took those items from his car, put on the gloves, entered the front door of the building, using the keys, and the front door of the flat, using the same keys. The flat was in darkness. He turned on the torch and entered the bedroom. Mr Corbett, awoken, got out of bed and the offender savagely attacked him with the knife, inflicting more than thirty injuries. Two of the knife thrusts entered the heart, one damaged the aorta and another, delivered from behind, entered the lung. Mr Corbett was unarmed. He had no warning and no chance. He died there and then. During the attack Mrs Corbett tried to push off the offender and in the course of doing so received a knife wound to the thigh. Not realising that she had been injured, she ran out of the building to summon help. The offender cut off Mr Corbett’s penis and placed it in the bedside drawer on top of the Cosmopolitan magazine. He closed the drawer. He left the house. He drove to the Parramatta River and threw in the knife and keys. He drove home, washed his clothes and waited for the police.  
     
      
    12 Mrs Corbett was able to get help and the police and ambulance officers attended. It was only then that Mrs Corbett realised that she had been stabbed. She was taken to hospital and her wound was stitched.  
     
      
    13 The offender was arrested in the early hours of 2 August 2006.  
     
      
    14 When he was arraigned at the commencement of the trial the offender pleaded guilty of the manslaughter of Mr Corbett. He said that he was not guilty of murder because his capacity to understand events or judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. When charged with the malicious wounding of Mrs Corbett he pleaded that he was responsible for wounding her but denied that the wounding was malicious.  
     
      
    15 Two psychiatrists gave evidence at the trial. Both had interviewed the offender but neither had treated him. He first saw Dr Westmore in April 2007. By that time he had been treated in the prison hospital with anti-depressants for about four months. The account he gave Dr Westmore of the events of 1 August 2006 was the first he had given. He had previously declined to answer questions the police would have liked to ask him. He said that having realised that all the lights were off at 9.30pm and that Mr Corbett’s car was parked there, that was what he could not take. He was overflowed with emotions and decided to do whatever he had to do. He retrieved the knife, a glove, a torch and the keys from the bag in his car and headed towards the building entrance. He said to himself “if I go forward there is no way back”. He said that he could not stop it. He knew what he was doing. He was conscious of what he was doing. He just could not listen to himself. He said to Dr Westmore “I wanted to take off the old man’s tool. I just know that I could not control myself. It is easy to call it anger. I cannot describe it. I just know I was uncontrollable and I was frightened”. 
     
      
    16 Dr Westmore took the view that the offender did not have available to him the defence that he was not guilty on the ground of mental illness and that he did not have available to him the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind.  
     
      
    17 The offender continued to be treated. He consulted a second psychiatrist, Dr Nielssen, in October 2007. He gave a somewhat different account. Whereas he had given Dr Westmore no reason for having driven to Stewart Street, he told Dr Nielssen that he had driven past the flat because it was his anniversary and he wanted to keep the relationship with Mrs Corbett. When he saw that the lights were off and he knew that Mr Corbett’s visit was not social, he went crazy. He said “I saw Marija and Barry in my imagination. I was flooded with emotions. It was like I was looking at the scene from a distance, it was not me. I saw myself doing it”. When the offender was asked why he had cut off Mr Corbett’s penis he said, “because it was our wedding anniversary”.  
     
      
    18 Dr Nielssen diagnosed major depression, on the basis of not only the offender’s account but on the medical records that were then available and on statements of persons who had observed the behaviour of the offender in recent times. The major depression was in remission. Taking these matters into account, Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that at the time of the offence the offender’s perception of the events, his capacity to judge right from wrong and his capacity to control his actions were significantly impaired. 
     
      
    19 The offender saw Dr Westmore a second time in January 2008. The offender showed him a drawing that he had made, showing three faces. The offender’s image was in the middle. On the left was the head of a man with horns and on the right a man’s head wearing a laurel wreath. He pointed to the figure with the laurel wreath and said that that was the man who had tried to stop him. The figures on the right and left were arguing in some way. He said that he was on the bottom and wanted to do another suicide. He had wanted to reconcile with his wife. The incident occurred on 1 August and 2 August was their wedding anniversary. He said “and I lost all hope. It wasn’t planned that I go there”. He said that he had left his house to buy dog food. He had previously purchased a card and wanted to write on it to celebrate the anniversary. He had trouble formulating words for the card. He said that he thought that if he drove by Mrs Corbett’s house he would get “an inspiration”. He said that he was not really surprised when he saw Mr Corbett’s car at the house because he knew that Mrs Corbett had another boyfriend, a thing he was tolerating. When asked what was different on that night he said “the light was off and I knew it was not just a friendly visit, and that was the difference”. He denied being jealous.  
     
      
    20 Dr Westmore also noted the other material, the reports about the prior treatment of the offender and the diagnosis of depression in December 2005 as well as the statements of various other witnesses about the accused’s demeanour and behaviour. He also had a copy of Dr Nielssen’s report.  
     
      
    21 Dr Westmore observed that there is a close relationship between depression and anger, that angry men are often depressed and that anger may sometimes be controlled by treating depression. He observed that the case was a difficult one because he thought that there were two competing emotions which had to be considered in understanding the aetiology of the offender’s aggressive action. He and Dr Nielssen agreed that he was depressed. He was also extremely angry. Dr Westmore thought that the additional history that he had received in the second interview might emphasise the importance of the depression in the offender’s behaviour, particularly the evidence of a lay witness that the offender was depressed in early 2006 and even more so in May of the same year. As well, Mrs Corbett had referred to his becoming withdrawn and having few friends. Dr Westmore thought that the fact that the incident occurred on the eve of the wedding anniversary and in the circumstance of his unhealthy preoccupation with his wife and his relationship with her and the fact that their relationship had broken down were all factors relevant to the issue of loss of control. Dr Westmore considered that the choice from a psychiatric perspective was whether the offender was an overcontrolled, angry, obsessive, jealous man and whether those characteristics were dominant in his actions towards the deceased or whether he was primarily a depressed man and whether those emotions were the dominant ones causing his actions towards the deceased. Dr Westmore accepted that whatever occurred, the offender suffered from extreme anger and a loss of control. 
     
      
    22 The offender gave evidence before the jury. He repeated the account that, having filled the car with petrol, he had become diverted by the need to gain inspiration for the anniversary card and had for that reason driven past the block of flats. Having realised that Mr Corbett was there and that the lights were off, he saw them together in his imagination. He had a feeling that he could not describe and that he had not had before. It overwhelmed and overpowered him. He tried to stop himself but could not. He entered the building and the flat. He felt empty. He felt as if he were not himself, that there were two people fighting over him. That is what he had tried to depict when he had later made the drawing. It was as though he were an observer sitting in the cinema. One of the men in the drawing told him that he was a coward. He saw just two hands of the actor and the rest was just like a movie, like a Hitchcock horror movie. He was just horrified to watch everything that happened. He could not remember how many times he had injured Mr Corbett. He said a couple of times. It was out of his memory. He remembered Mrs Corbett pushing him and then disappearing. After that he turned on the light and saw Mr Corbett naked. He saw his genitalia. He felt that the man was not resisting but still provoking him by shoving his genitals into his face. He cut off the penis and put it in the drawer. He was asked why he did that and said that he did not know. It just occurred to him. 
     
      
    23 The jury’s verdict shows that the offender failed to prove both that his capacity to understand events or judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition and that such impairment was so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. 
     
      
    24 I regard as implausible the offender’s explanation that he went to Stewart Street to gain inspiration for an anniversary card and that it was only at Stewart Street that some emotion, as though unexpectedly, welled up in his mind when he realised that Mr Corbett was with Mrs Corbett, that the lights were off and that it was his wedding anniversary. He was well aware that it was his wedding anniversary before he left Baulkham Hills. I think that he went to the house to see whether Mr Corbett was there and that his seeing his car came as no surprise. I do not think that there was any element of surprise for the offender at Stewart Street. The reasons why he went there can be better understood, I think, by considering some earlier events.  
     
      
    25 The offender, a rigid and obsessive man on questions of sexual morals, found out that his estranged wife was seeing another man. He suspected that they were having sexual relations. He found out where the man was living. He went to the man’s house and saw his wife’s car in the street. He stole keys and copied them so that he could enter Mrs Corbett’s flat undetected. He used them. He looked at the bedroom where Mrs Corbett and Mr Corbett, in the offender’s imagination, had had and would have sexual relations. He saw the Cosmopolitan magazine. I think that he took the keys with him when he left home on 1 August 2006 because he was intending to enter Mrs Corbett’s flat. I think he took a torch because he was intending to use it in the flat. I think he took a knife because he was intending to use it in the flat. 
     
      
    26 During cross-examination the offender tried to resist the suggestion that he was jealous of the relationship between Mrs Corbett and Mr Corbett, though eventually he reluctantly admitted that he was a little jealous. He held up a finger and thumb about a centimetre apart to show how little.  
     
      
    27 I think that on 1 August 2006 the offender carried out an act he had been thinking about for some time. It had its beginnings, perhaps, in his remarks that people who stole other people’s wives went unpunished and that in other countries people who committed adultery were stoned to death. Although I do not accept that he went to Stewart Street to gain inspiration for an anniversary card, I do think that the fact of the anniversary motivated him. I do not accept that he just happened to have with him the keys, the torch and the knife. I think that he left home with the intention of entering the flat and attacking Mr Corbett. His intent was to punish him by killing him for stealing another man’s wife. His disposal of the severed penis was intended to teach Mrs Corbett a lesson for her adultery. 
     
      
    28 Although I accept that the offender was suffering from depression, which constituted an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition, I do not accept that his capacity to understand events or judge whether his actions were right or wrong or to control himself was substantially impaired by that abnormality. He acted as an over-controlled, moralistic, jealous, indignant and angry man who decided to use a significant occasion to exact retribution. 
     
      
    29 That is not to say, however, that the offender’s depression can be put aside as of no effect. By August 2006 he had been suffering from the condition for a substantial time and it must have made keener his feeling of despair upon realising that he had lost the love and companionship of his wife. Whether the effect of his illness is described as impairing his capacity to a degree less than substantial or whether other terminology may be used may not matter. I am satisfied that the effect upon him of his illness does to some degree mitigate his criminality.  
     
      
    30 The offender was born on 15 March 1950 and is now 57 years of age. He has never previously been in trouble with the law. During the trial he expressed remorse for his actions. He declared that Mr Corbett was innocent and did not deserve to suffer what had happened to him. That was substantially different from what he had told Dr Westmore, namely that Mr Corbett was a victim of his own foolishness. The offender intends to forswear entitlement to any part of a joint fund of money, apparently the proceeds of the sale of investment property formerly owned jointly by Mrs Corbett and himself. That, I think, is some evidence of the genuineness of his recent expressions of remorse, though it can go little way to alleviating the loss and anguish which Mrs Corbett has suffered. I think that he regrets the hurt he has caused Mrs Corbett though. He may also be truly sorry for killing Mr Corbett, though the evidence of that is less impressive.  
     
      
    31 Not long after his arrest the offender was transferred to the Acute Crisis Management Unit at Long Bay because he was threatening to commit suicide. He was kept there until discharged in August 2007. During his time there he settled down, but on occasions indulged in self-righteous, stubborn and childish behaviour towards others. Shortly before the trial began he was readmitted to the Unit, I think under the stress of the forthcoming hearing. He is still kept there but, as before, he is being helped, and there seems no reason to suppose that he will not once again settle. Once the strain of this litigation is behind him his depression should return to remission and he should be able to pursue a normal path of assessment and work in the general gaol population. 
     
      
    32 The offender is highly intelligent. He does not seek the company of others and does not always tolerate it. He is impatient and contemptuous of others. He appears to have prospects of rehabilitation, though his rigid and selfish nature will make progress difficult for him, particularly when he is obliged to be in the company of those he would prefer to avoid. Circumstances like those that gave rise to these offences will not occur again, of course, and his risk of committing similar offences again is not high. That is not to say, however, that there is no need for the offender personally to be deterred from re-offending. 
     
      
    33 The features that tend to require a longer sentence are the cool, stealthy way the offender planned his attack and carried it out by surprise on persons who should have been safe in the privacy of their own home, the savage and sustained nature of the attack, the disgusting mutilation of Mr Corbett’s body after death and the histrionic use of the magazine in the drawer.  
     
      
    34 Those that tend to require a lesser sentence are the offender’s remorse, his prior good character and his chance of rehabilitation, that he will not offend again. He is entitled also to consideration for the economical way his case was conducted, not challenging the part he played in the attack on the deceased but raising only the partial defence of substantial impairment. There is also the effect of the offender’s depression, though that was limited and does not substantially reduce the need for a generally deterrent sentence. 
     
      
    35 Balancing these matters, I have come to the conclusion that I should set a non-parole period for the murder somewhat shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    36 The maximum penalty for malicious wounding is imprisonment for seven years. I think that the offender is genuinely sorry for wounding Mrs Corbett and I accept that he did not intend to do so. His plea of not guilty resulted from his lack of understanding of the requirements for proof of malice and he did not challenge the evidence. The offence of malicious wounding occurred incidentally during the course of the attack on Mr Corbett. There was no desire to stab Mrs Corbett. I think that a concurrent sentence is warranted in the circumstances. 
     
      
    37 Mrs Corbett read the Court a statement describing her love for Mr Corbett and the manner in which she has suffered and continues to suffer as a result of his cruel murder. She understands, I think, that the Court may not take these matters into account in imposing sentence for the murder, but I would wish her to know that the sympathy of the Court goes out to her in her loss, together with the hope that her hurt will become less in the future. 
     
      
    38 Gabor Ziha, for the murder of Barry Corbett I sentence you to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 years which will be taken to have commenced on 2 August 2006 and will expire 1 August 2024, and a balance of term of 6 years, which will expire on 1 August 2030. 
     
      
    39 For the malicious wounding of Marija Ziha I sentence you to imprisonment for a fixed term of four years, which will be taken to have commenced on 2 August 2006 and which will expire on 1 August 2010. 
     
      
    40 No case has been made for any further reduction of the non-parole period I have imposed on the first count to permit any extension of the period of eligibility for parole. The parole period I have allowed for is substantial. I have imposed a fixed term for the sentence on the second count because of the concurrency of the longer non-parole period on the first count. 
     
      
    41 The first day on which you will become eligible for release to parole will be 1 August 2024.

      2005/3574001 – REGINA v Lacy Lee JUKES 
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 24 August 2006 Lacy Lee Jukes (the offender) pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Mack Tepeanapene Hati on 13 September 2003. The offender was initially charged with murder and spent 90 days in custody before being released on conditional bail. 
     
      
    2 On 13 October 2006 in accordance with s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act) the offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of term of 12 months. The non-parole period was to commence on 13 October 2006 and to expire on 12 October 2007. The balance of term was to expire on 12 October 2008. The sentence was wholly suspended for a period of 2 years on condition that the offender be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years and be liable to be called up for sentence at any time within that period for any breach of that condition. It was a further condition that within 48 hours the offender report to an officer of the Probation and Parole Service at Tamworth and accept the supervision and obey all reasonable directions of the officers of that Service for a period of 2 years, or for such lesser time as specified by the Service. 
     
      
    3 On 24 December 2006 the offender and her then partner broke into her maternal grandmother’s house and stole a quantity of jewellery. She was charged with that offence in March 2007, pleaded guilty and was sentenced in the Tamworth Local Court on 21 November 2007. She was sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 6 months, such sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. She has commenced serving that sentence. 
     
      
    4 There is before the Court a report from the Probation and Parole Service dated 6 December 2007. The effect of that report is that the offender has not complied with directions of officers of the Service to attend counselling to address her continued substance abuse and mental health issues (depression). The offender frankly admitted to officers of the Service and confirmed in her oral evidence that she has been abusing amphetamines since the death of Mack Hati. The break and enter offence was committed to finance her own and her then partner’s addiction to amphetamines. 
     
      
    5 In her evidence the offender explained that she found attending counselling difficult because when she was aged 8 a counsellor had laughed at her complaints of sexual molestation. Thereafter she had found it almost impossible to confide in counsellors. The offender did attend a counselling session at the Tamworth Community Health Centre on 23 January 2008 but then failed to attend follow up sessions. The report of that attendance tends to confirm her evidence about having difficulty in attending counselling. 
     
      
    6 The offender said that she had ceased her relationship with her then partner shortly after the date of the break enter and steal offence and has not resumed contact with him. He is not the father of any of her children.  
     
      
    7 The offender was born on 11 November 1982 and is now 25. Her three oldest children are residing with an aunt and have done so since September 2003. She has the care of the two younger children aged 2 and 3. She is currently four and a half months pregnant. 
     
      
    8 The offender agreed that she had been moving around constantly since she entered into the good behaviour bond. She explained this by reference to bad relationships, the need to avoid previous partners who were likely to harm her and because she was experiencing problems with family and friends. No doubt her amphetamine abuse during the period would also provide an explanation. Significantly her mother was present in Court and remains fully supportive of her. 
     
      
    9 The offender said that she ceased using amphetamines about six months ago. Given the level of the offender’s dependence on amphetamines, and her failure to address her addiction by participating in counselling and rehabilitation, I am not persuaded that she has overcome that problem. It is, of course, to be hoped that she has done so given her pregnancy. 
     
      
    10 It should be noted in the offender’s favour that there has been something of a turnover in the officers from the Probation and Parole Service who have been in charge of her case (three in number) and this has not assisted the offender in building up a strong relationship with any of them.  
     
      
    11 Generally speaking the offender could offer no real explanation for her breaches of her obligations under s 12 of the Act other than her amphetamine addiction and her difficulties with attending counselling. Against that background I am not satisfied that I can give any weight to the offender’s undertaking that if she were given another chance she would attend counselling as and when required by officers of the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    12 The provision for suspended sentences is to be found in s 12 of the Act. Relevantly it provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “12(1) A court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender (being a sentence for a term of not more than 2 years) may make an order:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for such period (not exceeding the term of the sentence) as the court may specify in the order, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding the term of the sentence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    13 Section 98(3) of the Act deals with a s 12 bond as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “98(3) In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in section 12, a court must revoke the bond unless it is satisfied: 
         
          
         
          
          (a) that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 The consequences of the revocation of a s 12 bond are set out in  
     
      
      s 99(1)(c): 
       
       
        
        “99(1) If a court revokes a good behaviour bond:  
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        (c) in the case of a bond referred to in section 12:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the order under section 12 (1) (a) ceases to have effect in relation to the sentence of imprisonment suspended by the order, and 
           
           
          (ii) Part 4 applies to the sentence, as if the sentence were being imposed by the court following revocation of the good behaviour bond, and section 24 applies in relation to the setting of a non-parole period under that Part.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Part 4 of the Act deals with terms of imprisonment. 
       
      
    15 Quite clearly the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was not trivial in nature and s 98(3)(a) does not apply. The contrary was not submitted. 
     
      
    16 The only reasons offered for the offender’s breaches of the conditions of the bond were her amphetamine addiction and the difficulty she has in participating in counselling. I am not persuaded that these constitute “good reasons” within the meaning of s 98(3)(b). (DPP v Burrow & Anor [2004] NSWSC 433, DPP v Cooke & Anor [2007] 168 A Crim R 379). 
     
      
    17 The fact of the offender’s pregnancy is not a matter which I can take into account as a “good reason” for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. In Cooke, Howie J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[34] Hidden J in  
        Burrow 
         held that the subjective circumstances of the offender are generally irrelevant in determining whether there are good reasons to excuse the breach under s98(3)(b) except to the extent that those subjective circumstances are relevant to a consideration of the breach itself. … But subjective features of the offender at the time of the breach proceedings are irrelevant to the decision whether good reasons exist to excuse the breach. They may, of course, have some role to play in what order is made after revocation when determining whether the consequential sentence is to be served by way of fulltime custody, or an available alternative and the length of the non-parole period to be imposed. But they cannot affect the decision whether to revoke the bond.” 
        
       
      
    18 On the facts of this case it seems to me inevitable that the s 12 bond must be revoked and I do so. 
     
      
    19 The next question is as Howie J put it, what is an appropriate “consequential sentence”. In that regard it needs to be kept in mind that the offender is currently serving a sentence of periodic detention in respect of the break enter and steal offence. 
     
      
    20 I fully reviewed the offender’s circumstances when I passed sentence on 13 October 2006. There has been little change since that date and to the extent that there has been a change, I have referred to that in these remarks. Apart from the break enter and steal offence and her amphetamine addiction, the most significant change to her circumstances is her current pregnancy. That latter matter has troubled me when considering what is to be done with the offender and I have endeavoured to build some leniency into the course which I have adopted. 
     
      
    21 In addition to the circumstances of the offence of manslaughter, for which the offender now has to be sentenced, the Court needs to take into account that sentence is to be passed as a result of breaches of a s 12 bond. In R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320 at 322 King CJ said, in relation to such circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “I repeat what I said in  
        R v Buckman 
         (1988) 47 SASR 303 at 304: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “There is a clear legislative policy that in general a breach of a condition of a recognisance upon which a sentence has been suspended, should result in the offender serving the sentence which was suspended. A sentence of imprisonment is imposed and suspended only where imprisonment is fully merited and the Court considers it appropriate to give the offender a last chance to avoid imprisonment by leading a law abiding life. It is intended to be a sanction suspended over the head of the offender which is to be activated if there is a lapse into non law abiding ways. The Court will not lightly interfere with the ordinary consequence of a breach of the recognisance.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        It is of great importance that the Courts adhere to that principle. Departure from it by the non-revocation of suspended sentences tends to undermine the integrity of the system of suspended sentences and their effectiveness as a means of deterring future offenders.” 
        
       
      
    22 That approach was endorsed by Howie J in Cooke as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[23] With respect I would endorse those sentiments. There is nothing more likely to bring suspended sentences into disrepute than the failure of courts to act where there has been a clear breach of the conditions of the bond by which the offender avoided being sent to prison. Notwithstanding what has been stated about the reality of the punishment involved in a suspended sentence, if offenders do not treat the obligations imposed upon them by the bond seriously and if courts are not rigorous in revoking the bond upon breach in the usual case, both offenders and the public in general will treat them as being nothing more than a legal fiction designed to allow an offender to escape the punishment that he or she rightly deserved.” 
        
       
      
    23 On the facts of this case I see no reason to depart from the sentence which I previously passed. Accordingly I propose to impose a sentence of imprisonment for a period of 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year. I have allowed a parole period of 1 year in view of the offender’s pregnancy and to have regard to her need for rehabilitation in respect of her amphetamine addiction. These matters constitute special circumstances. I propose that the sentence be partially concurrent with the sentence she is already serving in respect of the break enter and steal offence. 
     
      
    24 As I noted in my previous remarks on sentence and in these remarks, the offender spent 90 days in custody before being released on bail. I propose to backdate the commencement of this sentence to allow a credit to the offender for the period which she spent in custody. 
     
      
    25 Lacy Lee Jukes you are sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 12 months to commence on 29 November 2007 and to expire on 28 November 2008 with a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 28 November 2009. The earliest date you will be eligible for parole is 28 November 2008.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 12 July 2005, the appellant was indicted before Murrell DCJ in the District Court of New South Wales on the following counts:  
     
      
      (1) That he on 8 April 2003 at Nowra in the Sate of New South Wales did wound [the complainant] with intent to murder [the complainant].  
      (2) In the alternative, that he on 8 April 2003 at Nowra in the State of New South Wales maliciously wounded [the complainant] with intent to do grievous bodily harm.  
      
    2 The appellant pleaded not guilty, and was tried before her Honour and a jury of twelve.  
     
      
    3 On 29 July 2005, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on count 1 and guilty on count 2.  
     
      
    4 On 4 October 2005, the appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of six years to commence on 8 April 2003 and to expire on 7 April 2009, with a balance of term of four years to expire on 7 April 2013.  
     
      
    5 The appellant appeals from his conviction.  
     
      
       
      Crown Case  
      
    6 It is convenient to set out first matters evidenced in the Crown case that were not disputed at the trial or on appeal, and that can be taken as established for the purposes of the appeal.  
     
      
    7 The complainant was born in 1978, met the appellant in 1998 and married him in 2001. They had two children. In March and April 2003, the complainant was separated from the appellant and had custody of the younger child Crystal, who was born on 4 September 2001. The elder child was then in the care of the complainant’s mother. The appellant was living in Sydney, and the complainant had moved to Nowra, and was living at 3/6 Shorland Place. A friend Michael Eggington had been staying with her for some days prior to 8 April 2003; and a friend of Eggington, Darren Griffiths, arrived the previous day and stayed overnight.  
     
      
    8 At about 8.30 am on 8 April 2003, the appellant came to the front door of this unit. The front door was open and the screen door was locked. The appellant asked to be let in. The claimant refused, and an argument developed. The appellant commenced kicking the screen door, and the complainant telephoned 000 and requested the police. This call was timed at 8.40 am.  
     
      
    9 Shortly afterwards, the complainant dropped the telephone and left it off the hook. The appellant kicked the window next to the door, and shattered the glass. The complainant’s daughter was nearby and was cut by glass. The complainant picked up the daughter and went away from the front door down a hall towards the bedrooms.  
     
      
    10 The appellant entered the unit and spoke to Eggington and Griffiths, and they left the unit through the broken window. Eggington then called the police on his mobile phone. Shortly afterwards, the appellant left the unit through the broken window, and ran off down the street.  
     
      
    11 The complainant unlocked the screen door and came out of the house with Crystal. Her throat had been cut, and she was holding a roll of toilet paper against it. She also had a wound to her chest caused by a sharp object.  
     
      
    12 The recording of the 000 call was in evidence. After a period of about half a minute to a minute in which the operators’ voices are heard (and also a male voice saying “get the fuck out”), there is a period of about a minute in which loud female screaming can be heard, and also a baby’s crying, and male and female voices that are difficult to make out. Towards the end of this period, a female voice can be heard quite clearly saying “Mick, help me with the baby please”.  
     
      
    13 A neighbour, Anita Reeve, saw through her window the appellant running down the street, and then went outside and saw the complainant sitting in her doorway holding something to her neck.  
     
      
    14 The Ambulance Service received a call to go to the premises at about 8.45 am.  
     
      
    15 Police arrived at the premises at about 8.55 am. One of the police officers, Constable Belinda Wiley, gave the following evidence on which she was not cross-examined, reading initially from a statement she had prepared using her notebook, and later from the notebook itself:  
     
      
       
        
        A. Yes. ""On Tuesday the 8th day of April 2003 Constable Elrihawi, Probationary Constable Dudley and I were at Nowra police station when police radio directed us to attend 3 of 6 Shorland Place, Nowra. Constable Elrihawi, Probationary Constable Dudley and I immediately left the station in Shoalhaven 18.""  
         
         
        Q. Shoalhaven 18 I take it is some vehicle?  
         
        A. Yes, that's our call sign we use over radio and that was the vehicle that we were assigned to that day, Constable Elrihawi and I.  
         
         
        Q. Keep reading.  
         
        A. ""We arrived at 3 of 6 Shorland Place, Nowra at 8.55am to see a female person who I now know as the complainant, Renee Spruill, crouched down in the front doorway of flat number 3. Spruill appeared to have blood all over her and over the ground. I immediately called for an ambulance and jumped out of the vehicle. As I entered the side gate of the flat I saw three males standing out the front. The two males standing on the front lawn in front of Renee's"" - sorry, I'll just go back. ""Two males were standing on the front lawn in front of Renee Spruill's flat. I know these males to be Darren Griffiths and Michael Justin Eggington.""  
         
         
        Q. I'll stop you there. Did you identify them on that day, that was the first time you met them?  
         
        A. Yes. I didn't know them beforehand.  
         
         
        Q. You can continue.  
         
        A. Okay. ""The other male I already knew as Dale Seymour.""  
         
         
        Q. Where was he standing?  
         
        A. Dale Seymour was standing out the front of his flat which I think was number 4.  
         
         
        Q. Continue at paragraph 6.  
         
        A. Okay. ""I went straight up to Renee Spruill in the doorway. Renee had blood all over her and she was holding a maroon towel up to the right side of her neck. I once again asked Renee, 'Who did this to you?' Spruill replied, 'My ex-husband.' I said, 'What's his name?' Spruill replied, 'Richard Spruill.' I didn't quite hear the surname so I said, 'Richard who?' She said, 'Spruill.""  
         
         
        Q. If you can continue at paragraph 7.  
         
        A. Okay. ""I then asked Renee Spruill, 'What is he wearing?' She said, 'Green pants, a black top. He's also African American.' I relayed this information to Constable Elrihawi who recorded this information in my official police notebook as I had blood on my hands at the time.""  
         
         
        Q. If I can just stop you there. In relation to the conversation that next happened is that one that is not in your statement?  
         
        A. Yes. Yes, some of that's not in my statement.  
         
         
        Q. Is it in the notebook entry on 8 April 2003?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Is there a reason why it's in your notebook but not in your statement?  
         
        A. Yes, I've got some conversation that was in the notebook that I haven't included I realise that in my statement and I guess that's due to my inexperience at that stage with making statements and being a junior police officer at that stage.  
         
         
        …… 
         
         
        Q. And did you then have a further conversation with her?  
         
        A. Yes, I did.  
         
         
        Q. And is part of that further conversation also one that's in your notebook but not in your statement?  
         
        A. Yes, that's correct.  
         
         
        Q. If you go to page 124 of your notebook.  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Was there recorded there a comment that the complainant made to you?  
         
        A. Yes, there is.  
         
         
        Q. And what was it that the complainant said to you?  
         
        A. ""The complainant said, He said he was going to kill me. I said to her, It's all right, we're here now, we'll get him.""  
         
         
        Q. Now in relation to the conversation that continued, is that then recorded in your statement at paragraph 8?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. You can start then at the second line.  
         
        A. Okay. ""I had a further conversation with Renee Spruill asking her does Richard have a weapon on him. Renee Spruill said, I don't know. That's when Eggington informed us that Richard had a knife. Renee Spruill started to panic, so I kept talking to her to keep her calm. I asked her, What did he do with this with? Renee Spruill said, I'm not sure, glass I think. I said, So a piece of glass? She said, I don't know.  
        
       
      
    16 An ambulance arrived a few minutes later. One ambulance officer asked the complainant what had happened, and she said “My husband attacked me”.  
     
      
    17 The appellant was arrested by police at about 9.30 am. One of the arresting officers gave this account of a conversation at the time:  
     
      
       
        
        Q. You told us just before lunch that the accused was placed into your police vehicle and you had a conversation with him.  
         
        A. That's correct.  
         
         
        Q. If you can return to your statement if you still have that in front of you and if you can tell us what that conversation was. I'll just indicate I'll stop you at one point.  
         
        A. Okay. ""I had a short conversation with the male. I said, 'Can you tell me what your name is?' The defendant said, 'It's Richard Spruill.' I said, 'Where do you come from, Richard?' The defendant said, 'From North Ryde. Unit 3 of 2 Ivanhoe Street, North Ryde.' I said, 'Richard, you understand you are under arrest for a serious assault in Nowra. I have been asked to arrest you and take you back to Nowra. Do you understand that?' The defendant said, 'Yes, sir.' I said, 'Richard, you are not obliged to say or do anything unless you wish but anything you say or do may be used in evidence. Do you understand that, Richard?' The defendant said, 'Yes, I do.' I said, 'Richard, tell me what that all means to you?' The defendant said, 'It means I don't have to talk about anything if I don't want to.'""  
         
         
        Q. If I can just stop you there. Was there then further conversation between yourself and the accused, Mr Spruill?  
         
        A. Yes, that's correct.  
         
         
        Q. Did he make mention during that conversation of the address in Shorland Place, East Nowra?  
         
        A. Of an address in Shorland Place, that's correct.  
         
         
        Q. Did you then continue to speak with him?  
         
        A. Yeah.  
         
         
        Q. And if you can continue with your statement. I said what happened, that section.  
         
        A. ""I said, 'What happened there, Richard?' The defendant said, 'I walked in, I saw two blokes sitting at the table shooting up heroin. They were sticking needles in their arms in front of my daughter. I don't want to say anymore.' I said, 'Richard, we are now going to Kiama police station and shortly after we will be going to Nowra, okay.' The defendant said, 'Yeah, mate.' I then noticed a small cut on the finger of the right hand. I said, 'Richard--  
         
         
        Q. On whose right hand?  
         
        A. The defendant's. ""I said, 'Richard, how did you get the cut on your hand?' The defendant said, 'Oh, just on some glass that's all.'""  
        
       
      
    18 There was some challenge to this officer’s evidence, because of a conflict between his evidence and that of another officer, as to whether the other officer was with him at the time. But there was no suggestion that this record of the conversation was inaccurate.  
     
      
    19 I interpolate here that the appellant did not give evidence at the trial, and there was no other evidence of any account by the appellant of what had happened. However, one of the expert witnesses said he had been told by police that the appellant claimed that the complainant had inflicted her injuries on herself; and that in fact was the essence of the appellant’s defence at the trial.  
     
      
    20 The appellant was observed by police after his arrest to have a cast on his left forearm, going about three-quarters of the way up his forearm, with a bandage round it. This cast had been observed also by the complainant and the other two men at the complainant’s unit.  
     
      
    21 The rest of the Crown case consisted mainly of evidence by the complainant, Eggington and Griffiths; and forensic evidence. This evidence was challenged by the appellant.  
     
      
    22 Briefly, the complainant’s evidence was that the appellant attacked her, punched her, put her in a headlock using his left arm that had a “sling” on it, and said words to the effect that if he couldn’t have her no-one else could; and that she felt a scratch on her neck, heard the appellant say, “so you want to die bitch”, and then realised that her throat had been cut. She admitted that in March and April 2003 she was using crystal amphetamine very frequently, and that she also used other illegal drugs. In cross-examination, she admitted she had told health authorities in 1997 that she had tried to commit suicide, and also admitted that medical records documenting a past history of suicide attempts were correct. She was aware that a high concentration of amphetamine was found in her system at the hospital after the incident.  
     
      
    23 Eggington’s evidence included evidence that, when the appellant came into the unit, he had a knife in his right hand, and that he saw the appellant punch the complainant. Eggington admitted using marijuana, and also a number of dishonesty offences; but denied using other drugs, and denied that he used drugs on the night before the incident or the morning of the incident.  
     
      
    24 Griffiths’ evidence also included evidence that, when the appellant came into the unit, he had a knife in his right hand. Griffiths admitted to using speed that night, together with Eggington, but he denied he was taking drugs when the appellant came into the unit in the morning.  
     
      
    25 The forensic evidence concerned the condition of the unit and the appellant’s clothing.  
     
      
    26 Apparent blood staining was seen at the unit inter alia on the west side of the lounge room near the entrance to the hall, at the entrance and on the door to bedroom one, and on the wall of the hallway near the entrance to bedroom two.  
     
      
    27 The appellant’s clothing had some brown stains on it, and was given presumptive testing for blood stains. Three areas on his shirt responded positively, and there were positive results also on his singlet, pants, jacket, shoe and underpants.  
     
      
    28 Evidence of Johan Duflou, the Chief Forensic Pathologist of the Department of Forensic Medicine, was that it was unlikely that the complainant’s wounds to her neck and chest were caused by glass, but that they could have been caused by a knife. He also said that blood drops on the appellant’s shirt were most likely to have come from blood dripping from a height and landing on the shirt when the shirt or the relevant part of it was horizontal; although there was a less favoured possibility that the blood could have sprayed on to it from an object. The high reading of amphetamine (0.38 milligrams per litre) in the complainant’s blood indicated high amphetamine use; and the toxic effects of amphetamine included violence, and could cause an acute psychosis.  
     
      
    29 One of the spots of blood on the appellant’s shirt was found to have DNA with the same profile as the DNA of the complainant.  
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Case  
      
    30 As noted earlier, the appellant’s case was to the effect that the injuries to the complainant were caused by the complainant herself, and were not shown beyond reasonable doubt to have been caused by the appellant.  
     
      
    31 The appellant’s only witness was Professor Starmer, an expert on the effects of drugs on people’s behaviour. Among the effects of methamphetamines are violence, paranoia, hallucinations and psychotic episodes. The violence could be directed towards others or themselves. Professor Starma found it hard to believe that the complainant had not had methamphetamines for two days before the sample was taken, because the concentration would indicate a very very large dose if taken earlier.  
     
      
       
      Issues  
      
    32 The appellant relied on three grounds of appeal:  
     
      
      1. The trial miscarried.  
      2. There was a miscarriage of justice.  
      3. The verdict was unsafe and unreasonable in all the circumstances.  
      
    33 Mr Ramage QC for the appellant supported ground 1 by pointing to a number of alleged erroneous rulings by the trial judge. I will deal in turn with these rulings, and then deal together with grounds 2 and 3.  
     
      
    34 On each matter, Mr Ramage’s submissions were comprehensive and detailed. I have read them carefully, but will summarise them briefly here rather than reproducing them in their full detail.  
     
      
       
      Presumptive Evidence of Blood Stains  
      
    35 Constable Vucko, the crime scene officer, produced photographs with captions marked “blood stains”, including captions identifying various marks on the appellant’s clothing. These were admitted over objection. The Crown also sought to lead evidence of presumptive blood tests using a hemastix marker. This was objected to, and the trial judge allowed it as “indicative evidence”, holding in terms of ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act that there was little relevant prejudice.  
     
      
    36 Mr Ramage submitted that it was a very important part of the Crown case to establish that there was blood on the appellant’s clothing, and since these presumptive tests were inconclusive, the evidence was highly prejudicial. He submitted that the prejudice was not overcome by explaining to the jury the limitations of the evidence or by concessions from the Crown that there were three possible sources for any blood that might have been on the appellant’s shirt (the complainant, the accused and Crystal). He referred to R v Robinson [2003] NSWCCA 118, in which there had been a similar ground of appeal; but pointed that in that case, the Court of Criminal Appeal had noted that the evidence had not been objected to and was of little significance.  
     
      
    37 I note that in R v Robinson the Court (Beazley JA, Hidden J and Caruthers AJ) at [188] commented that evidence of this kind was frequently led in murder trials, but suggested to the effect that it should not be led as a matter of course, without consideration of its relevance to the issues in the case at hand.  
     
      
    38 In the present case, the clothing of the appellant and photographs of that clothing were in evidence, showing stains that could have been blood stains. The trial judge explained, inter alia at paragraph [101] of the Summing Up, the limitation of the test. In my opinion, while it assisted the Crown case that the appellant’s clothing gave an appearance that was consistent with exposure to blood, it was not a very important part of the Crown case to establish that the stains were in fact blood. Indeed, in circumstances where the appellant’s defence was equally consistent with the complainant’s throat being cut in the presence of the appellant or in the absence of the appellant, even the detection of the complainant’s blood on the appellant’s clothing would not be inconsistent with the defence.  
     
      
    39 The Evidence Act in s 55 provides that relevant evidence is “evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings”. The presence of blood, and even the presence of bloodlike stains, on the appellant’s clothing was relevant, because the absence of such stains could rationally have affected the assessment of the probability of the complainant’s throat being cut while in close proximity to the appellant. It could further rationally affect the assessment of this probability if it were shown that the stains were in fact blood, or even if some alternative explanations for the stains were excluded. The presumptive tests in this case had the effect of excluding some, though not all, alternative explanations, and thus were relevant. In circumstances where the limitations of the tests were explained to the jury, and in circumstances where the question of whether these stains were or were not blood was not of great importance in the Crown’s case, the probative value of the evidence was certainly not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  
     
      
       
      Restriction of Cross-examination of the Complainant  
      
    40 The trial judge rejected questions of the complainant to the effect that, some seven years before, she had attacked people using a syringe.  
     
      
    41 It was put to the trial judge that this was relevant as indicating an aggressive and/or antisocial personality, and a willingness to use weapons, and also familiarity with drug use (and thus relevant to the appellant’s case that he saw drug use at the premises). Mr Ramage submitted further that it supported the defence case in circumstances where the complainant had attempted and threatened suicide. Mr Ramage referred to R v Cakovski [2004] NSWCCA 280.  
     
      
    42 Cakovski was an unusual case, in which a person accused of murder raised self-defence in circumstances where he had stabbed an unarmed man, alleging that, despite his possession of a knife, the deceased had persisted in aggression and threats to kill him. There was evidence that the deceased had killed three people 23 years earlier, and that a few hours before his death he had threatened to kill another person “like I killed the other three people”. The Court of Criminal Appeal considered that this evidence had substantial probative value, in relation to a question whether there was a reasonable possibility that the deceased had acted in what, at least in the absence of the evidence, could be considered an extremely improbable way.  
     
      
    43 In the present case, in my opinion the primary judge was correct to hold the evidence was not relevant. The bare fact of the alleged aggression against others, seven years earlier, had no relevance to the appellant’s case that the complainant could have inflicted the injuries on herself, and no relevance to the suggestion on behalf of the appellant that two men (not the complainant) were using drugs when he entered the premises. Particularly this is so in circumstances where the complainant was not disputing her history of suicide attempts and not disputing her own drug taking. To the extent that the evidence was relied on as going to the complainant’s credit, in my opinion, in the context of this case, it could not have had substantial probative value, in terms of s 103 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
       
      Opinion Evidence  
      
    44 Evidence was given, over objection, by Detective Senior Constable Asplin, the officer in charge of the investigation, who attended at the premises at about 9 am on 8 April 2003 and spoke to Eggington and Griffiths. In answer to a question “was there anything about the way they spoke with you or their body movements that indicated to you that they were under the influence of illegal drugs?”, Detective Asplin answered “No”.  
     
      
    45 Mr Ramage submitted that the possible effects of drugs on these witnesses was material to the accuracy of their evidence; and the appellant’s case was that he saw drug paraphernalia on the table when he entered the premises. Mr Ramage submitted that the experience of Detective Asplin over 15 years in the police force dealing with several hundred people apparently affected by drugs did not qualify him to give this evidence, because it did not qualify him an expert as to when a person was not affected by drugs.  
     
      
    46 In my opinion the evidence was properly admitted. Detective Asplin did not give evidence that the witnesses were not affected by drugs, or even that they appeared to be not affected by drugs, but rather that there was nothing about the way they spoke or their bodily movements that indicated they were affected by drugs. If, as the appellant seems to concede (correctly, in my opinion), Detective Asplin was qualified to give evidence of indicia that a person is affected by drugs, he was also qualified to give evidence that those indicia were absent.  
     
      
    47 Whether or not it could be inferred that the witnesses were not affected by drugs would depend on all the circumstances, and it was a matter for a jury whether they did or did not draw such an inference.  
     
      
       
      Direction on Unreliability  
      
    48 Mr Ramage submitted that the trial judge should have given a direction under s 165(1) of the Evidence Act in relation to the evidence of Eggington and Griffiths, relying particularly on paragraph (c). The provisions of s 165(1)(c) and s 165(2) and (3) are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        165 Unreliable evidence 
         
         
        (1) This section applies to evidence of a kind that may be unreliable, including the following kinds of evidence:  
         
         
         …… 
          
          
         (c) evidence the reliability of which may be affected by age, ill health (whether physical or mental), injury or the like,  
          
          
         …… 
         
         
        (2) If there is a jury and a party so requests, the judge is to:  
         
         
         (a) warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, and  
          
          
         (b) inform the jury of matters that may cause it to be unreliable, and  
          
          
         (c) warn the jury of the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it.  
         
         
        (3) The judge need not comply with subsection (2) if there are good reasons for not doing so.  
         
         
        ……. 
        
       
      
    49 Mr Ramage submitted that, because of the evidence by Griffiths of consumption of drugs during the evening of 7 April, the evidence of Eggington and Griffiths fell within paragraph (c) (being of the nature of “ill health”) and also was generally of a kind that may be unreliable.  
     
      
    50 In my opinion, it was well open to the trial judge not to be satisfied that the evidence of Eggington and Griffiths was of a kind that may be unreliable, within the meaning of s 165(1). Even accepting Griffiths’ evidence that he and Eggington consumed a $50 quantity of speed at around 6 or 7 pm the previous night, the trial judge was not bound to find they were affected at the time of the incident over 12 hours later. The hearsay evidence of the appellant’s allegations, made at the time of his arrest, would not have justified a conclusion that these witnesses were affected by drugs.  
     
      
       
      Directions on Recklessness  
      
    51 Although the appellant was charged on only two counts, the trial judge raised and decided that malicious wounding simpliciter should be left to the jury as an alternative to the second count, and the trial judge called this count 3. In relation to count 3, the trial judge directed the jury that maliciousness also covered the situation where the accused acted recklessly and wantonly, realising that he might wound the complainant but did not care, one way or the other, whether he did so.  
     
      
    52 Mr Ramage submitted that the jury was likely to have been misled and confused by the introduction of recklessness into the element of maliciousness so late in the day, and may have incorrectly substituted that for the specific intent required under the second count, or else been prompted to find intent under the second count because they rejected recklessness.  
     
      
    53 In my opinion, the directions made it clear that the directions only related to “count 3”; and because the jury convicted on count 2, the jury did not get to consider count 3. In my opinion, there is no sufficient reason to think the jury was confused or misled.  
     
      
       
      Verdict Before Directions Complete  
      
    54 Towards the end of the trial judge’s summing up, the trial judge told the jury she would send to the jury room a document “so that you know how the verdicts go”. The jury retired to consider their verdict at 2.17 pm on 28 July. Due to disagreements about the form of the document, it was not given to the jury that afternoon. Next morning, before the document was finally formulated, the judge received a message that there was a jury verdict. The judge said she would print out the document “and then have it given to the jury and then I will just wait a minute or so before bringing the jury in”. It was not disclosed in the transcript that the jury were in fact provided with the document. A matter was interposed, and the jury gave its verdict at 11 am.  
     
      
    55 Mr Ramage submitted that the judge should ensure that all directions are complete before the jury commences to consider its verdict (and a fortiori) before it reaches a verdict): McCormack (1996) 85 A Crim R 445, Lean (1993) 66 A Crim R 296, R v Sanford (1994) 33 NSWLR 172.  
     
      
    56 In my opinion, the document in question was not part of the directions to the jury. At paragraph [320] of the Summing Up, the trial judge explained what would happen when the jury’s verdict was taken. At paragraph [321], she said “I think what I might do is actually prepare a document and what I will do is I will show it to the barristers and when they are happy with it I will send that into the jury room so that you know how the verdicts go.” She went on “I am sorry that, at the end of a lengthy summing up I have rather muddled that up but when you get this document, you will understand clearly what the options are and, if not, you should certainly inquire.”  
     
      
    57 There was in fact no error in the explanation given in paragraph [320]. In my opinion, it was not an error by the trial judge to send the jury out before she provided this document, and no error in taking the verdict shortly after the document was provided. I would infer that the document was provided; but I would add that even if it was not, the circumstances would not suggest any miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
       
      Unreasonable Verdict?  
      
    58 Mr Ramage pointed to what he said were a number of unsatisfactory features of the case that should have caused a reasonable jury, properly instructed, to have a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the appellant.  
     
      
    59 Mr Ramage submitted the Crown case was consistent with attempted suicide: the medical evidence did not exclude the complainant having caused injury to herself; the complainant habitually kept a knife or knives under her bed or pillow; the level of drugs in her body was consistent with her being in a state of paranoia and/or depression, and of being prone to violence towards herself or others; and she had threatened and attempted to commit suicide.  
     
      
    60 Mr Ramage submitted that no reliance could be placed on the complainant’s evidence: it was redolent with contradictions, evasions and misstatements; she admitted she told lies and mixed reality and unreality; she gave contradictory evidence about her consumption of drugs; she was unable to give any coherent description of how the laceration occurred, of alleged punches or punching, of the alleged headlock, or of where she went and put Crystal (her accounts being inconsistent with the location of blood stains in the unit); her evidence of what was said was not supported by the triple-O tape; and she gave inconsistent stories to doctors.  
     
      
    61 Mr Ramage submitted that Eggington and Griffiths contradicted the complainant and were themselves unreliable. Both had spoken to the complainant before making their statements. They gave unsatisfactory and/or inconsistent versions as to the events of the previous evening, as to how Griffiths came to be at the premises, as to the consumption of drugs, as to the events of the morning, as to how the alleged assault occurred, and as to Eggington chasing after the accused.  
     
      
    62 Mr Ramage submitted that the objective evidence concerning blood was unreliable. In particular, the spot of blood on the appellant’s shirt, consistent with the complainant’s DNA, was most unlikely to have got there at the premises, because the expert evidence was that it probably dropped on to the shirt when the shirt was in a horizontal position. Police evidence and records were unreliable in many respects. The blood could have got onto the appellant’s shirt from the sample of the complainant’s blood taken at the hospital and set aside for the police, or could have been dropped from the bloody towel or clothing of the complainant taken by the police.  
     
      
    63 In my opinion, the question of the reasonableness of the verdict should be approached having regard to the issue that the jury had to decide. They heard the triple-O tape. They could properly conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the male voice saying “get the fuck out” was the appellant telling Eggington and Griffiths to leave, shortly after he entered the unit. They could properly conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the female voice saying “Mick help me with the baby please”, heard about one minute later, was the complainant asking for help about the time she came out of the unit to join Eggington and Griffiths, after her throat had been cut. A crucial issue in the case, having regard to the way it was conducted, was whether there was a reasonable possibility that, during this time of about one minute, the complainant may have cut her own throat and stabbed herself in the chest; and if the jury were satisfied there was no reasonable possibility that this happened, they could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who caused her injuries.  
     
      
    64 In considering this issue, a reasonable jury would take into account that the appellant had violently broken into the unit, that he had told Eggington and Griffiths to leave, that almost continuously throughout the period of about one minute that followed the complainant could be heard screaming, and that for some of that time a baby could be heard crying; that at the end of this period the complainant was heard asking Eggington to help her with the baby; that about this same time the appellant was running away down the street; and that within about ten minutes the complainant was telling police that the appellant did “this” to her and had said he was going to kill her, and Eggington was telling police that the appellant had a knife. The question then was, was there a reasonable possibility that the complainant, in this particular period of about one minute, located a knife, used it in the vicinity of her daughter to cut her own throat and stab herself in the chest, and that she then (or within a period of about ten minutes before the police arrived) disposed of the knife in such a way that the police did not find it.  
     
      
    65 Giving full weight to Mr Ramage’s submissions about the complainant’s history of threatened and attempted suicides, it is in my opinion unlikely in the extreme that, in circumstances where the complainant had been confronted by the appellant, who had violently broken into her unit, and where she was continually screaming, she would have conceived and carried through the idea of getting a knife and cutting her own throat and stabbing herself in the chest, in the presence of her child, and would then have emerged from the unit asking for help with the child.  
     
      
    66 The circumstances strongly corroborated the substance of the complainant’s own evidence as to what happened; and the considerable problems pointed out by Mr Ramage about the complainant’s general credibility and about the details of her evidence do not in my opinion significantly affect the credibility of the substance of her account. I note in particular that the circumstance that the complainant did not give evidence of seeing the appellant with a knife, as did Eggington and Griffiths, does not detract from the credibility of the substance of her evidence, but on the contrary tends to suggest she was not giving a contrived account.  
     
      
    67 Similar comments can be made about the considerable problems pointed out by Mr Ramage about the general credibility of Eggington and Griffiths and the details of their evidence. In my opinion, however, their evidence, insofar as it related to matters in dispute, contributed little to the positive Crown case, apart from their evidence that they saw the appellant carrying a knife (this being consistent with Eggington’s statement to police shortly after the incident). They were both outside at the time of the alleged assault, although Eggington did give evidence of seeing the commencement of it.  
     
      
    68 As regards the police evidence, there is substance in Mr Ramage’s criticisms of the unreliability of the police records and as regards other aspects of the police evidence. However, the only really significant aspect of the police evidence as regards matters seriously in dispute was the evidence concerning the spot of blood with DNA matching that of the complainant; and even that was of less than crucial significance, because it was consistent with the appellant’s defence that the complainant could have cut her throat while he was present. In any event, the expert evidence did not rule out the possibility that the spot could have got on to the appellant’s clothing while the appellant was standing close to the complainant; and to the extent that the expert evidence suggested that this was unlikely, the jury could weigh this against what could be considered the unlikelihood of it getting on to the appellant’s clothing, either accidentally or by design, at some later stage.  
     
      
    69 In all the circumstances, in my opinion a jury could reasonably be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. Indeed, it is difficult to see how they could have arrived at any different conclusion.  
     
      
       
      CONCLUSION  
      
    70 I propose the following order: appeal against conviction dismissed.

   Introduction1. The plaintiff and the defendant each apply for costs orders following the handing down of my judgment in these proceedings: Hennessy v Lynch (No.3) [2007] NSWDC 268. I note that interest on the judgment debt has been mathematically agreed in the sum of $1,038.39.2. Each of the parties seeks costs orders pursuant to s.48A Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) as follows: 
     
     (a) the plaintiff seeks orders that the defendant pay the plaintiff's costs of these proceedings on a party/party basis; 
      
      
     (b) the defendant seeks an order that each party pay his own costs of these proceedings up until the expiry date of an offer of compromise served on 20 April 2007 and that thereafter the plaintiff pay the defendant's costs on an indemnity basis. 
      
    3. In the judgment handed down on 13 December 2007, I made the following orders: 
     
     (1) Judgment for the plaintiff in relation to the first publication (on or about 6 October 2001) in the sum of $1,000. 
      
      
     (2) Judgment for the plaintiff on the second publication (on or about 14 October 2002) in the sum of $5,000. 
      
      
     (3) Judgment for the defendant in relation to the third publication (on or about 18 December 2005). 
      
      
     (4) Judgment for the plaintiff in relation to the fourth publication (27 March 2006) in the sum of $10,000. 
      
      
     (5) Parties have liberty to bring in short minutes of order containing the mathematically agreed interest payable on the judgment of $16,000. 
      
      
     (6) Issues of costs reserved, and the parties have liberty to apply. 
      
      
     (7) Exhibits remain with the file for 28 days. 
    4. The matters complained of in these proceedings were a series of slanders published over a long period to only one person, a Mr Hasler, an employee of the plaintiff.5. This application for costs raises important questions concerning costs in defamation actions, and in particular concerning the ambit of s.48A Defamation Act 1974. Although this section has been in force since 17 February 2003, the only case in which its provisions have been considered and applied, following an application by a defendant, is the decision of Graham J in National Auto Glass Supplies (Aust) Pty Ltd v Nielsen & Moller Auto Glass (NSW) Pty Ltd (No.9) [2007] FCA 1826. No applications have previously been made by plaintiffs, although I have recently heard an application by a plaintiff in other proceedings in this court. 6. The plaintiff and the defendant each rely on different parts of s.48A. While there is nothing in s.48A indicating that the court should adopt a different approach where the applicant is the defendant (as is the case in England – see Gatley on Libel and Slander, 10th ed., [35.15]), in practical terms applications by plaintiffs under s.48A involve different considerations. In addition, the general principle has always been that considerations sufficient to justify refusal of costs to a plaintiff may not be sufficient if the applicant is the defendant, because the former initiates the litigation while the latter is brought into it against his will: Ritter v Godfrey [1920] 2 KB 47 at 53 per Lord Sterndale MR. 7. Section 48A is referred to in passing in Jones v Sutton (No.2) [2005] NSWCA 203, but the Court of Appeal (at [74]) noted that the provisions of this section were not relied upon and considered the costs application on common law principles. The plaintiff in those proceedings successfully appealed a judgment for the defendant but did not appeal the trial judge’s assessment of $5,000 for three publications (two to one person and one to three persons). The costs for this action were well over $1 million (Hansard, 12 October 2005, p, 18518) and it was because of his concern that costs were “massively out of proportion to the damages” that Mr David Barr MLA introduced the Defamation Amendment (Costs) Bill in 2002 which, although unsuccessful, led to the enactment of s.48A.8. There are no decisions on s.48A of the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal to guide me as to the interaction between the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), and in particular Parts 26 and 42 of the Rules concerning the offer of compromise provisions.9. Since this application raises important issues relating to costs in defamation proceedings, it is appropriate that I should set out the history of attempts by the legislature to make special provisions in relation to costs in defamation actions, particularly concerning costs where the verdict is of modest size.Law reform proposals for defamation costs.10. The question of whether there should be special rules for costs in defamation proceedings was first raised in the legislative assembly as long ago as Friday, 30 April 1886 when Mr George Reid moved a second reading of a bill to limit costs in defamation actions to verdicts of more than 40 shillings. Mr Reid said: 
     
     ""I do not think that I need apologise to the House for introducing a measure with reference to the law relating to libel and slander, because I think that it is generally admitted, and there have been striking instances of the fact, that the law is not at all in a satisfactory condition at the present time."" 
    11. Mr Reid went on to note that if a defendant in an action for libel and slander was unable to pay the verdict, he could be imprisoned for up to a year. Mr Reid's intention was not to reform the law of libel, but to bring about reforms designed to assist defendants who were ""substantially acquitted of the charge which forms the subject of the action"" where the jury had returned a small verdict. It had been for centuries the law in England that in slander, where the verdict was for an amount less than 40 shillings, the costs should not exceed the amount of a verdict (21 James I, Chapter 16). This had in turn been replaced by Act 58 George III, Chapter 30, which provided that where damages were assessed under 30 shillings ""then the plaintiff or plaintiffs in such action or suit shall have and recover only so much costs as the damages so given or assessed shall amount to without any further increase of the same"" (see Hansard, 30 April 1886, page 1609). 12. At the time Mr Reid proposed this amendment, judges in the Supreme Court had to certify for costs in cases where the verdict was under £30 if there was ""sufficient reason for bringing and trying the said case in the Supreme Court"". However, the general principle was that, where the matter in contest involved difficult questions of law or complicated questions of fact, costs could be certified even for a small amount, and this is what in fact occurred. A plaintiff could establish that despite the verdict being small he may justly have expected a larger sum, costs could be awarded, and since these were matters that were within the province of a jury to decide, considerable latitude was given concerning costs by the judge presiding at the trial. In particular, a rule justifying a plaintiff in bringing his case before ""a superior tribunal"" meant that an action could be commenced in the Supreme Court and the litigation conducted in a most expensive way. Even if the plaintiff was awarded a farthing, under this rule, it would be held that it was an action which should be brought before a superior court and a certificate for costs would issue. 13. Mr Reid went on to describe a series of cases where a derisory verdict of a farthing had been awarded but the defendants, including journalists from the bulletin, although having been substantially vindicated by the farthing verdict, had been consigned to gaol because of their inability to pay the costs. 14. I have set this out in some detail because the problems described by Mr Reid have a familiar ring today. Defamation cases are often “combative”, to use Levine J’s description of the multiple trials in Antoniadis v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 24 April 1997); Levine J awarded indemnity costs at the third trial of these proceedings to the plaintiff for an offer of compromise of $5,000, noting the two earlier trials had been discharged by “the fault of the defendant” (at 11). Even where the extent of publication is limited, defamation actions still result in very substantial legal costs. In Skalkos v Assaf [2002] NSWCA 14, where there were two limited publications (one to one person), the costs certificate for the trial totalled $941,444.77: Skalkos v T S Recoveries Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 281. 15. These were cases that went to trial; costs in actions that never go to trial can also be high, particularly if the defendant is an ordinary member of the community without the financial resources to pay thousands of dollars of legal fees. The introduction of so-called SLAPP suits to stifle free speech was an issue of concern in the NSW Parliament when the Defamation Bill 2005 had its second reading speech (Hansard, page 18518). The bringing of an action for an ancillary dominant improper purpose has long been recognized as being a basis for the granting of indemnity costs at common law: Packer v Meagher [1984] 3 NSWLR 486; Stevens v Sullivan [2002] 1 DCLR (NSW) 138.16. After many years of complaints in the press about litigation costs, particularly in articles in a newspaper in his electorate about a controversial local case, Mr David Barr, the Member for Manly, introduced the Defamation Amendment (Costs) Bill 2002, which sought to restrict costs orders to the quantum of damages awarded. Although this Bill was rejected at the time, Mr Barr was able, as he later noted (Hansard, 16 October 2003), to add his recommendations into an amendment to the NSW Government's Defamation Amendment Bill 2002 resulting in subsection 1(b) being inserted into s.48A Defamation Act 1974. 17. Mr Barr was not convinced that this measure went far enough, in that this provision did not necessarily inhibit unnecessary and frivolous court actions, and as a result of the defamation proceedings which were the subject of controversy in his electorate, introduced the Defamation Amendment (Costs) Bill. It introduced a threshold figure of $25,000 and was modelled on a provision of s.101.02A South Australian Supreme Court Rules which provided that plaintiffs were unable to claim costs in defamation where the damages awarded were less than $25,000 unless the Court otherwise ordered. Mr Barr's bill sought to exclude this discretionary power because the experience in New South Wales in defamation actions was that the Court was ""too inclined to exercise this kind of discretionary power in favour of the plaintiff"". The purpose of the threshold figure was to ""discourage trivial actions where the plaintiff's reputation might be slightly dented at worst but the cost incurred could be enormous"". Mr Barr referred to the heavy onus placed on defendants by SLAPP writs. As this Bill was defeated, it is of historical interest only, but it does indicate what he considered to be a “trivial” verdict.18. Thus s.48A, unlike its predecessors, is intended to protect both plaintiffs and defendants from the enormous costs burdens that can result from defamation litigation, if the manner of conducting the litigation by either of them falls foul of its provisions. Section 48A19. Section 48A provides as follows: 
     
     “ 
     48A Costs in proceedings for defamation  
      
      
     (1) In awarding costs in respect of proceedings for defamation, the court may have regard to the following matters:  
      
      
      (a) the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases (including any misuse of a party’s superior financial position to hinder the early resolution of the proceedings),  
       
       
      (b) whether the costs in the proceedings may exceed the quantum of damages to be awarded in the proceedings,  
       
       
      (c) such other matters as the court considers relevant.  
      
      
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1), a court must (unless the interests of justice require otherwise):  
      
      
      (a) if proceedings for defamation are successfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the plaintiff—order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the defendant unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff, or  
       
       
      (b) if proceedings for defamation are unsuccessfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the defendant—order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to accept a settlement offer made by the defendant.  
      
      
     (3) In this section:  
      
     ""settlement offer"" means any genuine offer to settle the proceedings made before the proceedings are determined and includes an offer to make amends (whether made before or after the proceedings are commenced). 
     ” 
    20. Despite the introduction of s.48A, and the inclusion of an almost identical provision in s.40 Defamation Act 2005, it is not generally referred to in costs applications. In West and Fortunate Investments Pty Ltd v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 767 Simpson J awarded damages totaling $50,000 but awarded the plaintiff only three-quarters of the costs because the damages fell so far below the threshold ($225,000) in Part 52A r.33 Supreme Court Rules; consequently, the action could have been commenced in, or transferred to, the District Court. In its summary of the case the Gazette of Law and Journalism (GLJ Archives, “Costs – October 2003”) noted that one week after this “costs contortion”, Part 52A r.33 Supreme Court Rules was amended to exempt defamation cases from this requirement.21. The purpose of s.48A, and its interaction with Part 52A r.33 Supreme Court Rules, was explained by Mr Neville Newell (Hansard at page 7134): 
     
     ""While the addition of proposed s.48A(2) will provide greater discretion to a judge in awarding costs in instances where parties have been recalcitrant than currently exists, s.48A(1) makes it abundantly clear that in awarding costs the Court may take account of the way the parties have conducted their case. The Court will be able to take into account such matters as whether either party has used their significantly more powerful financial position in a way that hinders the effective discharge of justice. 
      
      
     It is important to keep in mind that the aim of s.48A, which was introduced by the government in December 2002, was to protect ordinary members of the community against potentially ruinous cost implications from defamation actions. Section 48A commenced on 17 February 2003, and I am unaware of any defamation case invoking s.48A having been finalised. While it is too early to tell whether the amendments have achieved their aim and whether there is any need for further amendment along the lines advocated by the Honourable Member for Manly, calls for amendment are premature."" 
    22. Mr Newell considered that Part 52A rule.33 would not impinge on s.48A. This rule was expressed to be: 
     
     ""an acknowledgment that while the majority of defamation matters decided in the Supreme Court result in damages awards of less than $225,000, the Supreme Court may well be the appropriate jurisdiction in which to hear the matter because of the complex legal issues raised. It is important to note, however, that judges will still be required to take into account the matters referred to in s.48A of the  
     Defamation Act 
     , and that judges will have the discretion to make a range of costs orders, including that no costs be payable. 
      
      
     I believe it is essential that the Supreme Court continue to hear defamation matters which give rise to complex legal issues. The rule change will ensure that that will be the case. I am also confident that there exists sufficient safeguards to prevent the Supreme Court presiding over shorter, less complex defamation matters that ought rightly to be tried in the District Court ... These factors include the status of the plaintiff and the circulation of the newspaper, the quantum of damages likely to be obtained, whether the imputations are serious or of the utmost gravity, whether there are any major matters of principle that would warrant consideration of the Supreme Court, and the prospect of the matter being dealt with more quickly in either the Supreme Court or the District Court."" 
    23. The verdict in West was comparatively low in comparison to other Supreme Court damages awards. The Opposition, in opposing Mr Barr’s Bill, noted that there were only four Supreme Court awards since 1999 where the verdict (net of interest and costs) did not exceed $25,000: Hansard, p.7134 (30 October 2003). This pattern has continued, with the majority of Supreme Court defamation verdicts exceeding $100,000, which is another reason why s.48A has never been invoked in the Supreme Court.24. Having set out the legislative history of s.48A, I should also note the general principles of common law that are applicable in its interpretation. The general rule has always been that cost should not be denied to a successful plaintiff in a defamation action unless there has been some misconduct on his or her part: Cooper v Whittingham (1880) 15 Ch D 501 at 504 per Jessel MR. Examples commonly pointed to include a contemptuous verdict (such as the famous farthing verdict in the ‘QBVII’ case, Dering v Uris [1964] 2 QB 669, where the plaintiff unwisely failed to accept a payment into court); where the plaintiff has pursued the action not to vindicate a legitimate interest but for reasons of malice and personal spite: Morgan v Wallis (1907) 33 TLR 495; or where “it appears that it was oppressive to bring the action, or that the action was oppressively conducted.” (per Lord Escher MR in Williams v Ward (1886) 55 LJQB 556 at 567.)25. There have been a number of cases in Australia where a plaintiff who prolongs or delays litigation may be denied costs if later successful, notwithstanding success in court, and the circumstances of these cases form the bases for s.48A.26. Two particular evils have been identified in s.48A. The first is misuse of a party’s superior financial position. This can occur whether the party with the superior financial position is the plaintiff or the defendant. Section 48A(2) is, however of particular relevance in the present case in that it provides that where a plaintiff has commenced proceedings for defamation, if the defendant has unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer “or agreed to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff” a court “must” order costs of and incidental to the proceedings on an indemnity basis.27. This is a very strong incentive to defendants to make offers of compromise of a reasonable nature. That is the primary basis upon which the defendant’s application is brought here. 
     
      
        
      
    The issues in these proceedings28. The plaintiff and defendant both referred to the provisions of s.48A and the provisions of the Rules relating to offers of compromise. 29. On behalf of the plaintiff, Mr Connell submitted that the provisions of s.48A must prevail over the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules concerning offers of compromise, as the latter are mere regulations. The Court has a wide discretion in relation to offers of compromise and should exercise it in favour of the party who, in reality, had won: Roache v News Group Newspapers [1998] EMLR 161; this discretion had been exercised generously in a number of defamation cases. The plaintiff did make offers, although above the sum awarded and just before the trial, and s.48A(2) should prevail over the offer of compromise regulations. The plaintiff should be entitled to his costs for the whole of the trial, including the cost of senior counsel. In particular, the plaintiff should have his costs of the s.7A jury trial, where the defendant did not give evidence, and where the plaintiff was successful. The defendant could have waived the need for a s.7A jury trial.30. Mr Campbell SC, for the defendant, submitted that s.48A entitled his client not only to costs from the date of the offer of compromise, but to a favourable costs order (i.e. no costs order) for the period prior to the offer by reason of the plaintiff’s manner of conduct of the litigation. In addition, he submitted that Jones v Sutton (No. 2) was authority for the proposition that senior counsel was not required for this straightforward trial, where the publications were simple slanders and the defence was unlikelihood of harm (as had been the case in Jones v Sutton (No. 2)). As to waiving the s.7A jury trial, this was an unheard-of step and while it might be appropriate to do so in a newspaper publication, it was not reasonable where the matter complained of was a slander and where issues of whether the publications were merely vulgar abuse needed to be determined by a jury.The offers that were made and the conduct of the litigation31. In order to deal with these applications I should first set out a short history of the litigation and the offers of compromise.32. These proceedings were commenced by statement of claim on 26 May 2006. Originally the plaintiff claimed damages for three oral publications on 14 October 2002, 18 December 2005 and 26 March 2006. There was a challenge to the imputations and, following the filing of amended pleadings, a fourth publication dated 6 October 2000 was added. A s.7A jury was empanelled on 14, 15 and 16 February 2007 and the jury found that a series of imputations was conveyed by each of the publications.33. The defendant filed a defence of unlikelihood of harm, followed by an amended defence pleading a defence of partial justification to some of the imputations and a defence of qualified privilege at common law. On the day of the hearing, all defences except s.13 were abandoned. The matter was listed for hearing for 27-30 August, 4 September and 14 September followed by written submissions and judgment was handed down on 13 December.34. In accordance with the usual procedure after a s.7A trial (as to which, see Haertsch v Andrews and Ors, Ireland J, 1 December 2000) no costs order was made following the s.7A trial, even though the plaintiff was substantially successful, on the basis that defamation cases are heard in a two stage hearing and any application for costs would be premature. The plaintiff was again substantially successful in the trial in that damages were awarded for three of the four publications (the defence of unlikelihood of harm succeeding in relation to the third publication). While modest damages of $1,000 were awarded for the first publication, damages of more substance were awarded for the second and fourth publications.35. However, during the course of the litigation, the defendant served three offers of compromise upon the plaintiff. Two of these three offers were for sums substantially in excess of the total damages awarded. In addition, the defendant made an offer at an informal settlement conference. The plaintiff made two offers of compromise for sums substantially in excess of the damages awarded.36. The history of these offers is as follows: 
     
     (a)  
     20 June 2006 
      
      
     Approximately a month after proceedings were commenced the defendant served an offer of compromise for $2,000 plus costs. 
      
      
     (b)  
     20 April 2007 
      
      
     After the s.7A jury trial, the defendant served an offer of compromise in the sum of $20,000 plus costs as agreed or assessed. 
      
      
     (c)  
     Undated informal offer 
      
      
     According to a letter dated 23 August 2007 at about this time there was an informal discussion as to settlement in the course of which the defendant offered to settle the plaintiff's claim for the sum of $70,000 inclusive of costs. According to the letter from Higgins & Higgins of 23 August 2007, the plaintiff's legal representatives advised that they had no instructions to respond to that offer. This led to the third offer of compromise of 23 August 2007, which was a response to the plaintiff's offer of compromise of 12 July 2007. 
      
      
     (d)  
     Plaintiff's offer of 12 July 2007 
      
      
     The plaintiff on 12 July 2007 offered to settle for $50,000 plus costs by way of offer of compromise. 
      
      
     (e)  
     23 August 2007 
      
      
     The defendant offered to settle by way of an offer of compromise for $33,500 plus costs. 
      
      
     (f)  
     24 August 2007 
      
      
     The plaintiff offered to settle for $65,000 plus costs, in a without prejudice letter. 
    37. The proceedings commenced on the following Monday, 27 August 2007.38. I note that after the proceedings were concluded the plaintiff made an offer of settlement of $10,000 plus costs. The defendant responded to this in a letter of 3 September 2007 offering to accept the sum of $10,000, to pay the plaintiff's costs up to 20 April 2007 on a party/party basis but for the plaintiff to pay the defendant's costs from 21 April 2007 on an indemnity basis.39. Each of the parties agreed that this offer of settlement, which occurred after the hearing was over, could not be relied upon as being an offer of compromise in accordance with the Rules. Mr Campbell SC submitted, however, that it was part of the whole chain of reasonable conduct by the defendant that this offer was made. In other words, the defendant had offered to pay the plaintiff's costs up to 20 April 2007 on a party/party basis (subject to the costs orders already made in favour of the defendant remaining), and it was submitted that the defendant's failure to accept this offer was a matter relevant to the exercise of discretion pursuant to s.48A.Application of these principles to the facts in this case40. The defendant in these proceedings clearly complied with his obligation under s.48A to make offers of compromise. He made three offers, one immediately after the litigation was commenced and two before the trial. They were all substantial offers and, in the case of the second and third offers, far exceeded the damages awarded. There was no reply to these offers, although a counter-offer was made in the days before the trial on liability.41. The provisions of s.48A are not intended to undercut the Offer of Compromise provisions in the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules; they are intended to reinforce them. There is no inconsistency between the provisions. Accordingly, the plaintiff must pay the defendant’s costs on an indemnity basis from the date of the April offer, which exceeds the sum I awarded to the plaintiff.42. This brings me to the question of the costs order I should make in relation to the balance of these proceedings. The plaintiff asks me to make no order as to costs or, if I am disposed to make a costs order, not to allow the costs of Senior Counsel, for the reasons set out by the Court of Appeal in Jones v Sutton (No. 2). The plaintiff draws my attention to the similarity between the two cases, in that in each case there were oral publications to one person where no issue of legal difficulty arose.43. With great respect to the Court of Appeal in Jones v Sutton (No. 2), I do not understand their reasons for excluding Senior Counsel’s fees from any part of the trial of an action which, in addition to being a complex s.7A jury trial concerning republication issues, was the first post-1995 trial on the defence of unlikelihood of harm before a judge. The large number of appeals from perverse verdicts in s.7A trials (which were described in Parliament as “an abomination” during the Second Reading speech of the Defamation Act 2005 on 13 September 2005) is another sound reason why it is appropriate to retain an experienced Senior Counsel for these actions.44. I was the trial judge in the judgment appealed from in Jones v Sutton (No. 2), and I noted that if I had awarded the $5,000 damages I assessed, I would not have awarded costs on common law principles, by reason of the very small size of the verdict. The Court of Appeal in Jones v Sutton (No. 2) does not refer to this finding, preferring instead to deprive the plaintiff of selected costs on other grounds. The issue of proportionality as to the costs of the action and the damages awarded is of central importance, not only in defamation proceedings but for all civil litigation: s.60 Civil Procedure Act 2005.45. It is my view that the Court of Appeal’s decision in Jones v Sutton (No. 2) can be distinguished for two reasons. The first is that the damages award in Jones v Sutton is very close to nominal damages; the award to Mr Hennessy in these proceedings is three times as large. The second is that the publications in Jones v Sutton (No. 2) were made in the course of such extraordinary hatred and hostility that Mr Hennessy and Mr Lynch would seem almost friendly by comparison. In Jones v Sutton I did not accept any of the witnesses called by the plaintiff as to hurt to feelings, including the plaintiff, and these findings were referred to by the Court of Appeal as significant on costs. No similar finding was made here.46. As to whether the defendant should have waived a s.7A trial, the defendant was sued over first three, and then four, publications he made long ago when he was angry and (in relation to the last three) affected by alcohol. In my view it was appropriate for him to await the s.7A jury finding before making a substantial offer. He discharged his obligations under s.48A(2) by making an offer early in the litigation, and by making further offers of very substantial sums after the s.7A hearing. The delay between the dates of publication and the commencement of proceedings are also relevant.47. In Arian v Nguyen [2001] NSWCA 5 at 37 Ipp A-JA noted that an order that a successful party pay some part of the unsuccessful opponent’s costs requires “strong justification” and that an order to pay all the costs would only be made in “exceptional circumstances”. The justification in the present circumstances for any variation would be the factors set out in s.48A, on the facts in this case.48. It would be a crushing blow to impose upon any plaintiff who had been defamed a number of times (and awarded damages) the burden of paying his own costs in addition to the order I must make against him for his failure to accept the offer of compromise. Accordingly I am not prepared to make any order other than that the costs follow the event.49. However, the event in question is that the plaintiff succeeded in three claims for defamation but failed on one.50. In Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd [1977] 2 NSWLR 749 the plaintiff succeeded in six out of nine actions for a series of publications of a similar nature, recovering a total of $17,000 in jury verdicts. The costs were reduced on appeal to two thirds of the general costs of these actions, including a sustained attack on the plaintiff’s reputation. It is my view that I should be guided by the principles enunciated by the Court of Appeal in Morosi and award the plaintiff a proportion of his costs representing his success in the litigation.51. Mr Connell submitted that the third publication, on which the plaintiff failed, took up very little time, but in my view, on the facts in this case, each of these publications was equally important. Accordingly I propose to order the defendant to pay three-quarters of the plaintiff’s costs up to the date of the offer of compromise filed in these proceedings.Orders1. Vary order 6 of the orders of 13 December 2007 and order the defendant pay three quarters of the plaintiff’s costs up until the final date for acceptance of the defendant’s Offer of Compromise dated 20 April 2007 and that the plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs thereafter on an indemnity basis.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 10 April 2005, the appellant fell and sustained injury while attending a cultural festival conducted by the respondent. She brought proceedings against the respondent claiming damages. On 16 March 2006, Ashford DCJ determined these proceedings, giving a verdict and judgment for the respondent and ordering the appellant to pay the respondent’s costs. The appellant appeals from that decision.  
     
      
    2 We are dealing with that appeal, and also with a motion brought by the respondent seeking an order to the effect that the appeal is incompetent. Having regard to the view that the court has reached on the merits of the appeal, it is not necessary to deal with the notice of motion. However, I would comment that the notice of motion should have been brought within a limited time after the lodging of the appeal, and it was not brought when it should have been brought.  
     
      
    3 At the trial the appellant gave evidence that she had been born in Fiji in 1954, had married in 1975, and came to Australia with her husband and children in 1990. On the day of the accident, she and her friend, Ms Nadan, arrived at Blacktown Showground at about 12.30pm for a cultural festival. They paid an admission charge and for a time watched some entertainment on a stage. There were some hundreds of people present.  
     
      
    4 The appellant gave evidence that she and Ms Nadan then went to stalls selling food, and they had lunch. The appellant’s evidence was that, as they went back to the stage area, she tripped on something and fell to the ground on her right arm. When she stood up, she saw a rope running along the ground, and two men with turbans doing something with the rope. She said “this rope was not here”, and one of the men said “sorry, we are marking this for the sport, the sports is going to be held here”.  
     
      
    5 The appellant’s evidence was that the ground was hard and the grass was brown, and that the men were about three to four metres apart, the one on her right who spoke to her being “not even a metre from where I fell”. The other man was standing near a post. The rope was tied right at the bottom of this post and was lying on the ground and was straight. It was rope coloured and maybe as thick as the appellant’s finger. The appellant said she did not see the rope before she fell because there were “so many people around”.  
     
      
    6 Ms Nadan gave evidence to somewhat similar effect. She was walking maybe a metre behind the appellant when the appellant fell, and she looked and there was a rope on the ground. However, Ms Nadan could not remember if there was a post the rope might have been attached to, and she said it was in a coil sort of position, it was “like twisted” and was not straight.  
     
      
    7 Both the appellant and Ms Nadan drew diagrams showing the stalls to which they went as being in an area to the left of the stage, looking from the stage; and showing the rope as extending across the front of the stage to a point near the stalls, and locating the fall as being at a point to the left of the stage or perhaps opposite to the left extremity of the stage.  
     
      
    8 The defendant called three witnesses: Mr Dharia, who said he was the overall organiser of the event; and Mr Pooni and Mr Khakh, who said they had erected the rope for the sporting events on that occasion. All of them gave evidence that this rope was erected in an area to the right of the stage, looking from the stage, and that the stalls were some distance from the stage generally in front of it and extending both to the left and right of it.  
     
      
    9 Neither Mr Pooni nor Mr Khakh had any recollection of the appellant or of anyone falling; and for her part, while the appellant remembered seeing Mr Dharia on the stage, she had not seen either Mr Pooni or Mr Khakh before.  
     
      
    10 Mr Pooni gave evidence that there was an area intended to be roped off and that was roped off by him and Mr Khakh. They got the rope from behind the stage, the rope being fluorescent orange, about five millimetres diameter and about 50 to 60 metres long. They set it up in an L-shape to the right of the stage, and they used about 15 poles each about one metre high. Mr Pooni said that he banged the poles in with a hammer, and as each pole was hammered in the rope was looped round the top and pulled taut, this being done by both Mr Pooni and Mr Khakh. The poles were about six metres apart. At the venue there were other ropes on tents, but this was the only rope erected where races were to be conducted. When they set up the rope, there were no other people there.  
     
      
    11 Mr Khakh gave somewhat similar evidence, although he gave very different estimates as to the length of the rope and also as to the distance of the stalls from the front of the stage. His evidence was also rather vague about the procedure for looping or tying the rope to the top of the posts.  
     
      
    12 Mr Dharia gave evidence to the effect that Mr Pooni and Mr Khakh roped off the area for the sports, and gave evidence also that there were few people in that area when the ropes were set up.  
     
      
    13 So far as concerns this appeal, the important part of the decision of the primary judge was her decision rejecting a case of negligence against the respondent. The case was put both in terms of negligence at common law and also a failure to take due skill and care in terms of s 74 of the Trade Practices Act. However, nothing was made of any possible distinction between those two causes of action.  
     
      
    14 The reasons for the primary judge’s decision adverse to the appellant are set out in paras [26]-[31] of her judgment as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        26. The evidence in relation to the rope over which the plaintiff is alleged to have fallen differs. On the one hand the plaintiff described the rope as being ""rope coloured"". The witnesses for the defendant described the rope as being 'orange fluoro'. The plaintiff's witness was not asked the colour of the rope. There is general consensus that the surface of the showground was dry grass. The plaintiff and her friend did not recognise any of the defendant's witnesses as being the persons present in connection with tile rope. The defendant's witnesses did not recognise the plaintiff or her friend.  
         
         
        27. Taken at its highest the plaintiffs evidence is that the rope was rope coloured and thus not easily seen on the dry surface of the showground, saying there was a lack of reasonable care taken by the defendant to ensure persons such as the plaintiff would not fall over such a rope and be injured. The plaintiff’s evidence was that she tripped on something and when she got up she saw the rope running along the ground, concluding she fell over the rope. The plaintiff says there were other people in the area and by inference a rope such as that on the ground constituted a risk. Both the plaintiff and Mrs Nadan were to my mind reasonable witnesses. They did not appear to prevaricate or try to mislead in giving their evidence in respect of the description of the plaintiffs fall although detail of the fall was sketchy. However, the defendants witnesses were also reasonable witnesses who did not seem to me to be untruthful or to attempt to mislead. Indeed all those who gave evidence did so with conviction:.  
         
        28. There are no extrinsic aids such as photographs/rope or the like before me which might assist me to form a conclusion such as to resolve this evidentiary dilemma.  
         
         
        29. Each version of events is plausible. Both versions cannot be correct. There was only one area for the races. The defendant submits that reasonable care was taken by the defendant in constructing this area and this was done in an area where there were not a lot of people present and each pole was done one at a time and the rope then attached and pulled taut. Each of the defendant's witnesses maintained the rope was a bright colour and thus easily seen. It was day time. If the rope was orange then it would seem to me it would have been easily seen by any person in the vicinity. It was not suggested the rope was hidden in any way.  
         
         
        30. The evidence of the defendant's witnesses is cogent and compelling in giving a clear rope description and describing the activity they were performing and I accept and prefer their evidence to that of the plaintiff which was lacking much detail.  
         
         
        31. I am satisfied the defendant owed a duty of care to persons such as the plaintiff coming into the festival but I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities the plaintiff fell as a result of any negligence on the part of the defendant nor that any material supplied in respect of the defendant's event was unfit for the services supplied. I am not satisfied the defendant left any rope unattended on the ground. As a matter of common sense if the rope was orange coloured, as I accept, even if it were on the ground and unattended it would have been obvious to persons such as the plaintiff taking care for her own safety and thus I am of the view that her claim must fail.  
        
       
      
    15 Ms Norton SC for the appellant made three broad submissions as to unfairness at the trial and error by the primary judge.  
     
      
    16 In relation to the statement by the primary judge, supporting preference for the defendant’s witnesses in para [30] of her judgment, to the effect that the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses was cogent and compelling in giving a clear rope description and describing the activity they were performing, Ms Norton provided a schedule showing inconsistencies and unclarities in the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses, and submitted that their evidence was not cogent and compelling but rather conflicting and confused. Ms Norton’s submission was to the effect that the statement I have referred to by the primary judge was in error, and that the primary judge did not give adequate reasons for accepting the evidence of these witnesses.  
     
      
    17 The second point, which I understand to be both an independent ground and also a further support for a submission that the defendant’s case was not clear and compelling, was that two extremely important aspects of the defendant’s case were not put to the plaintiff in cross-examination as they should have been. Ms Norton submitted that it was not put to the plaintiff in cross-examination that the only area where sporting activities were conducted at the event was an area to the right of the stage, some distance away from where the plaintiff said her accident occurred and in a quite different part of the venue; and it was not put to the plaintiff that, at the area where the sporting activities were conducted and a rope put up, there were very few people at the time when the rope was being put up. Ms Norton submitted that it was unfair to the plaintiff that these important aspects of the defendant’s case were not put to her, and she also submitted that the failure of the defendant to put these matters to the plaintiff further confirmed that the defendant’s case was not the cogent and compelling case that the judge referred to.  
     
      
    18 The third broad submission made by Ms Norton was to the effect that the primary judge did not make a finding as to what happened to the plaintiff, having made a finding of preference of the defendant’s witnesses. The primary judge should, Ms Norton submitted, have gone on to make a finding as to what happened to the plaintiff rather than simply dismissing the plaintiff’s case.  
     
      
    19 I will deal in turn with those three matters.  
     
      
    20 I have carefully considered the schedule provided by Ms Norton and the evidence given by the defendant’s witnesses. It is clear that in certain respects Mr Khakh’s evidence in particular differed from that of Mr Pooni and Mr Dharia, in relation to estimates of length and distance; and I accept that Mr Khakh’s account of precisely how the rope was attached to the post was unclear. However, in my opinion a reasonable inference is that Mr Khakh was not a good judge of lengths and distances, and just did not have a clear recollection of how the rope was attached. In other respects, in my opinion, the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses was clear and consistent in substance, and in particular was clear and consistent as to the general location of the area where the sporting events were to be held and where ropes were put up, and clear and consistent as regards the lack of any large number of people in that area at the time when the ropes were being set up.  
     
      
    21 Ms Norton did point to a difference between Mr Pooni and Mr Khakh, on the one hand, and Mr Dharia on the other hand, the former saying there was no-one else there when they put the rope up and Mr Dharia saying that there were a few other people there; but in my opinion that is not a significant difference, and may be explained by the circumstance that they were not in their evidence referring to precisely the same distances from where a particular activity was being carried on over a particular time.  
     
      
    22 I think there is force in Ms Norton’s submission that the defendant’s case on the location of the area where sports were held, and its case that this was the only area where sports were held, should have been put squarely to the plaintiff, and also the defendant’s case that there were very few people in that area at the time the ropes were being put up should also have been squarely put to the plaintiff.  
     
      
    23 However, the plaintiff’s evidence as to her accident was challenged, and when the defendant’s witnesses came to give their evidence, the nature of the defendant’s case was clear. If the plaintiff did have something helpful to her case that she could have said in relation to those particular aspects of the defendant’s evidence, that is a matter that could have been dealt with in reply. So although ideally the case should have been put to the plaintiff in cross-examination, I do not think the manner in which the case was conducted gave rise to an unfairness that could be regarded as suggesting miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    24 Having regard to these considerations, I do not think the primary judge was in error in reaching the view that the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses was cogent and compelling and gave a clear description of the rope and the activity they were performing, and in particular gave a clear description of where they were performing it, and the fact that there were few people in that area at the time. In my opinion, the judge was entitled to take that view, and the judge gave adequate reasons for reaching it.  
     
      
    25 Accordingly, in my opinion the primary judge was justified in reaching conclusions that the only ropes for sporting events on the occasion were ropes put up to the right of the stage and not in the location described by the plaintiff; that there were very few people in the area where the ropes were being put up at the time they were put up; that the rope was tied to the top of each post and then carried to the next post; and that the rope was fluorescent orange; and the judge was justified in all those respects in not accepting the contrary evidence of the plaintiff.  
     
      
    26 Ms Norton’s submission is in effect that the primary judge should have gone on to find exactly what happened to the plaintiff, and to indicate with some precision what she accepted or did not accept about the plaintiff’s evidence to the effect that the plaintiff tripped over a rope, spoke to two people putting up the rope, these people not being Mr Pooni or Mr Khakh.  
     
      
    27 In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case it was not essential for the primary judge to spell out precisely what she found in relation to the plaintiff’s evidence. There were perhaps three broad possibilities. One was not accepting the plaintiff at all. The next was accepting that something like what the plaintiff described occurred, but in some other area apart from the area where the rope was put up by Mr Pooni and Mr Khakh. The third was that it did happen in the area where Mr Pooni and Mr Khakh put up the rope.  
     
      
    28 The primary judge did not make it clear which of those three possibilities she preferred, but para [31] rather suggests that of the three she was inclined to accept the third of them. Plainly in relation to the other two, in my opinion, the plaintiff would not have made out a case in negligence against the defendant. If it was a different rope in a different area, then the plaintiff’s evidence as to what was said in relation to sporting events could not be really made sense of, and it would be in my opinion impossible to construct a scenario showing negligence by the respondent.  
     
      
    29 If, as seems to have been the primary judge’s preference, something happened in the area described by Mr Pooni and Mr Dharia, again there would seem to be no basis in the evidence for any finding of negligence against the defendant. A clearly visible rope was being put up in an area with few people around; and although perhaps the primary judge’s reference to a rope being left unattended on the ground was one which did not have any support in the evidence, the judge was really left in a position where it was difficult if not impossible to make a clear finding as to what happened.  
     
      
    30 In all the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the judge’s reasons were inadequate or that her conclusion was wrong.  
     
      
    31 For those reasons, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed with costs, and I would propose that the notice of motion for orders as to the incompetency of the appeal also be dismissed with costs.  
     
      
    32 BEAZLEY JA: I agree.  
     
      
    33 TOBIAS JA: I also agree.  
     
      
    34 BEAZLEY JA: The orders of the court are those proposed by Justice Hodgson.

   Introduction1. The plaintiff in these proceedings was awarded a total of $85,000 in damages in actions for assault, wrongful arrest, false imprisonment and defamation: Photi v Target Australia Pty Ltd [2007] NSWDC 265 (11 December 2007). Interest on damages has been agreed at $5,016. 2. The plaintiff now seeks an order for indemnity costs of the trial pursuant to s.48A Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) and s.98 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW). The basis for the application is the defendant’s conduct of the trial, and in particular the late application (made in the course of addresses) to amend the defence to plead a defence of qualified privilege at common law. The history of the delay to the proceedings caused by this late amendment is set out in my judgment of 11 December 2007 at [7] – [18]. Effectively, the handing down of judgment was delayed from 27 June (the last day of the trial) to 23 November (when the parties completed their submissions, following which I handed down my judgment of 11 December 2007).3. The defendant concedes that the late amendment was made in circumstances warranting an order for indemnity costs, but submits that this should be restricted to the costs thrown away by reason of the late amendment, namely from 27 June to 23 November 2007. The defendant also relies upon s.48A to demonstrate the “reasonableness” of the defendant’s conduct in accordance with that section, and submits that the conduct referred to in s.48A as constituting grounds for indemnity costs has not been made out.Section 48A Defamation Act 19744. This application raises an important issue in defamation actions, namely the costs issues specific to defamation actions which resulted in the enacting of s.48A. Although this section came into force on 17 February 2003, and was referred to (but not analysed or applied) in Jones v Sutton (No. 2) [2005] NSWCA 203, it has only been judicially considered once (by Graham J in the Federal Court), in National Auto Glass Supplies (Australia)Pty Ltd (No 9) [2007] FCA 1826 (23 November 2007), where the defendant brought the application. This is the first application brought by a plaintiff relying upon s.48A.5. Section 48A provides: 
     
     “ 
     48A Costs in proceedings for defamation 
      
      
     (1) In awarding costs in respect of proceedings for defamation, the court may have regard to the following matters:  
      
      
      
      (a) the way in which the parties to the proceedings conducted their cases (including any misuse of a party’s superior financial position to hinder the early resolution of the proceedings),  
       
       
      (b) whether the costs in the proceedings may exceed the quantum of damages to be awarded in the proceedings,  
       
       
      (c) such other matters as the court considers relevant.  
       
       
      
     (2) Without limiting subsection (1), a court must (unless the interests of justice require otherwise):  
      
      
      
      (a) if proceedings for defamation are successfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the plaintiff—order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the defendant unreasonably failed to make a settlement offer or agree to a settlement offer proposed by the plaintiff, or  
       
       
      (b) if proceedings for defamation are unsuccessfully brought by a plaintiff and costs in the proceedings are to be awarded to the defendant—order costs of and incidental to the proceedings to be assessed on an indemnity basis if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to accept a settlement offer made by the defendant.  
       
       
      
     (3) In this section:  
      
     ""settlement offer"" means any genuine offer to settle the proceedings made before the proceedings are determined and includes an offer to make amends (whether made before or after the proceedings are commenced).” 
    6. The circumstances leading to the enactment of s.48A can be traced through Hansard to a private member’s Bill introduced by Mr David Barr MLA, the member for Manly. Mr Barr’s concern about defamation costs arose after a particular defamation case caused great concern in his electorate. He put forward a private member’s Bill designed to prevent plaintiffs who brought defamation actions where the actual damages were extremely small from claiming what he called “millions of dollars” in legal costs. Although the Bill was defeated, the NSW Government adopted some of his proposals which were put into the text of s.48A in the Defamation Bill 2002. The text of s.48A offered protection to plaintiffs as well as defendants in that the conduct of litigation (and in particular the failure to make settlement offers by a defendant) could be relied upon in relation to applications for costs, including indemnity costs. This is an important feature of this statutory provision.7. Section 48A has never been referred to in Supreme Court litigation, possibly because Part 52A r.33 of the Supreme Court Rules 1970 (NSW) was amended in 2003 to remove defamation from the list of actions which required an application for recovery of costs for proceedings where the damages were less than $225,000. This occurred following the decision in West & Anor v Nationwide News Pty Ltd [2003] NSWSC 767 where Simpson J reduced the costs of plaintiffs who had been awarded a total of $50,000, on the basis that the litigation could have been conducted in the District Court. Simpson J noted this might lead to more defamation cases being commenced in the District Court. Part 52A r.33 of the Supreme Court Rules was then amended to exempt defamation actions from this requirement. (A further Bill brought by Mr Barr to prevent this amendment was defeated: Hansard, p.7134, 30 October 2003). 8. The desirability of a law to prevent the costs abuses that are allegedly a feature of defamation litigation led to the adoption of s.48A in the uniform defamation provisions enacted by all States and Territories of Australia. In the course of the Second Reading speech for the Defamation Act 2005(NSW), Mr Barr traced the history of abuse of costs in defamation and praised the introduction of s.40 into the new Act: 
     
     “ 
     Mr DAVID BARR (Manly) [9.35 p.m.]:  
     … A significant amendment is clause 22, which will put an end to separate section 7A trials. These were an abomination and had the effect of doubling costs because, in effect, two trials were conducted on the same matter. They involved a number of imputations, which became incredibly complicated. For example, the case of  
     Jones v Sutton 
     , in my neck of the woods, went for more than 11 days in a two-part trial. The damages awarded were $5,000 but the costs amounted to well over $1 million between the two parties…  
      
      
     The costs were massively out of proportion to the damages. One of my pet issues in the whole defamation debate is costs. All the various royal commissions, inquiries and whatever in many jurisdictions have focused on the complexities of the law – what tests should apply and so on – but none has dealt with costs in any significant manner. I introduced the  
     Defamation Amendment (Costs) Bill  
     2002 to restrict costs orders comparative with the amount of damages awarded, but the House did not support it. The view of the Government and the Opposition was that it was too prescriptive. My view was that it was one way of discouraging the rich and powerful from engaging in frivolous actions because they would not be able to get costs.” 
    9. Mr Barr went on to note that he had been successful in moving the amendment to the Defamation Act 1974 that inserted s.48A, and added: 
     
     “I had hoped the courts would take [s.48A] on board. It is one way of addressing the disproportionality between damages and costs. The issue is serious because it means that the law, as in so many other areas, is the domain of the wealthy, because even minor matters can involve high costs. That is especially the case now that the Supreme Court rules have been amended and even minor matters go straight to the Supreme Court.  
      
      
     I opposed that proposal in this Chamber at that time, but once again I lost out. The Government and the Attorney should monitor costs because it is one area in which the law clearly has not been working the way it should.”

    The Civil Procedure Act and indemnity costs applications10. The enactment of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 gave the court significant powers of case management, including costs, designed to ensure that the administration of justice is “just, quick and cheap”, to use the formula in s.56.11. Cases on delay in legislation such as Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996) 139 ALR 1 generally deal with the problems created by delay before the hearing in the form of late amendments before the trial. Amendments during the trial create just as much, if not more, difficulty. The problems caused by cases becoming part-heard are considerable. Relevant issues, including issues of credit, need to be dealt with while the facts are fresh in the judge’s mind, or the risk of judicial error through oversight increases. Adjourning a case part-heard creates not only expense and delay but also, more importantly, injustice, and it is a problem which in my view will continue until there are sanctions at appellate level concerning such conduct.The pleadings and facts in this case12. The action for defamation was a series of imputations pleaded as arising from statements allegedly made by the defendant’s employee Mr Parker. At all relevant times he denied making these statements, as did the other witnesses called by the defendant. However, one witness called by the defendant, Mr Harb, admitted in cross-examination that he heard Mr Parker making these statements.13. The defences pleaded were justification (s.15) and unlikelihood of harm (s.13), which do not require admissions of publication. The defendant brought the application to amend to plead qualified privilege at common law in the course of the defendant’s counsel’s closing address. The case then had to be adjourned part-heard. The plaintiff agreed to the amendment and reopened her case to file a Reply particularising malice. The defences all failed, including the defence of qualified privilege at common law.The plaintiff’s application14. The plaintiff brings her application on three bases: 
     
     (a) pursuant to s.98 
      Civil Procedure Act 
     , on the basis of the manner of conduct of the trial, including the late amendment; 
      
      
     (b) on common law principles concerning the costs consequences of late amendment:  
     Beoco Ltd v Alfa Laval Co Ltd  
     [1995] QB 137; and 
      
      
     (c) pursuant to s.48A  
     Defamation Act 
      1974. 
      
    15. The conduct complained of relates to all four defences to the defamation claim: 
     
     (a) the late pleading of the common law qualified privilege claim, which delayed judgment from June to December 2007; 
      
      
     (b) the dropping of the s.7A defence in closing submissions;  
      
      
     (c) the dropping of the s.13 defence which the defendant gave no notice of until August 2007; and 
      
      
     (d) as to the justification defence, the circumstances in which the first hearing had to be adjourned because Mr Parker failed to attend, resulting in an order for indemnity costs. Mr Parker also showed reluctance to attend the second hearing, despite being served with a subpoena on this occasion. An application was made to me for the issue of a warrant for his arrest, which I refused:  
     Photi v Target Australia Pty Ltd (No. 2) 
      [2007] NSWDC 302. Mr Parker in fact attended the following day. This application caused delay during the trial. 
    The defendant’s submissions16. The defendant in written submissions first asserted that a defence of qualified privilege had already been pleaded, in that the defence of justification refers to the matter complained of being published concerning a matter of public interest or, in the alternative, on an occasion of qualified privilege (defendant’s submissions, paragraphs 2-4). The plaintiff did not ask for particulars during the trial and could not be heard to complain now about the absence of particulars.17. While the form of the defence of justification does refer to “qualified privilege” (as an alternative to the public interest component of the defence), this does not amount to pleading a defence of qualified privilege. Qualified privilege is a defence that must be pleaded and particularised so that the plaintiff knows what case he or she has to meet: Sims v Wran [1984] 1 NSWLR 317. This was never done, and the case was conducted on the basis that Mr Parker never said the words attributed to him, not on the basis that the words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege at common law.18. The defendant also submitted (submissions paragraphs 5-7) that Mr Evatt had stated he was not troubled by the lack of particularisation and that the only reason this had come up was because I had expressed concern about the lack of pleading or particulars for the defence. The defendant points to Mr Evatt’s statement that “No one is going to the Court of Appeal” (T 251 line 20) as a concession that he did not object to the lack of pleadings or particulars (and presumably, would not appeal if he lost on this basis).19. The plaintiff did consent to the amendment of the defence to plead qualified privilege at common law, because the plaintiff could not afford the costs associated with an appeal, as I indicated in my judgment of December 2007 at [16]. The plaintiff did, however, object that the amended defence was inadequately pleaded and that issues of malice were never able to be ventilated through cross-examination. 20. The defendant makes no submissions concerning the plaintiff’s complaint about the late dropping of the s.7A and s.13 defences.21. As to the problems with the defence of justification, the defendant submitted that Mr Parker, a former employee, was a person over whom the defendant had no control, and the fact that an order for indemnity costs was made in relation to the first trial date should be disregarded.22. It is not to the defendant’s credit that these proceedings, in addition to the adjournment caused by the late pleading of the qualified privilege defence, had a prior hearing adjourned in circumstances calling for an indemnity costs order. Time in court is a precious commodity. To cause one adjourned hearing is unfortunate, but to cause two adjournments looks like carelessness.23. The defendant also submitted that as an offer of compromise (for $40,000 plus costs) had been served, the provisions of s.48A(2)(a) had not been made out. The plaintiff agreed with this submission, although noting the offer fell well short of the sum awarded.Conclusions24. Defamation is a cause of action akin to strict liability; once the publication has been proved, the question is whether the publication is excused, protected or justified by law. Thus an important threshold issue is whether or not publication is admitted.25. Of the four defences advanced by the defendant, two (s.13 and s.7A) were abandoned in submissions. Whether or not the words were spoken had taken up a substantial part of the trial time. As to the defence of qualified privilege at common law, added during submissions, this was a hopeless defence in that Mr Parker denied ever saying the words. The fact that one of the defendant’s witnesses agreed in cross-examination that Mr Parker did say these words could not, without more, constitute a basis for the defence. Finally, there were delays in the evidence concerning justification while Mr Barko unsuccessfully applied for a warrant concerning Mr Parker’s failure to attend court. 26. While independently these flaws might fall short of warranting an order for indemnity costs, the cumulative effect is that the conduct of the defamation proceedings is such as to warrant an order for indemnity costs in accordance with the principles enunciated in s.98 Civil Procedure Act and s.48A Defamation Act.27. However, the conduct of the actions for assault, wrongful arrest and false imprisonment were (with one exception, referred to below) unaffected by these problems. Should any order for indemnity costs be limited to the defamation claim, or should the order for indemnity costs extend to the whole of the costs from the first day of the trial?28. The one exception concerning the conduct of the other causes of action is that the plaintiff was not able to obtain judgment for almost six months concerning these other claims as a result of the defendant’s conduct of the defamation action she had brought. 29. If the difficulties caused by the defendant’s late pleading of a defence of qualified privilege at common law had been attended to expeditiously, judgment could have been handed down shortly after 24 August. The defendant’s failure to provide submissions in accordance with my orders of 27 June caused significant further delay. This delay impacted on all of the causes of action pleaded by the plaintiff, not just the defamation action.30. It should be noted that the requirement for costs to be proportional to the remedy is not restricted to defamation actions; s.60 Civil Procedure Act contains a similar requirement. The defendant’s conduct in relation to the defamation part of the claim caused delay to the whole of the litigation, which was compounded by the failure to provide written submissions, including written submissions on the claims for wrongful arrest, assault and false imprisonment.31. Delay to the final resolution of proceedings is conducive to injustice whether the delay occurs prior to, during or at the end of a trial. If a trial date has to be vacated because of unreadiness of a party, subsequent unreadiness is likely to be viewed more seriously. In a busy court like the District Court, cases should only be adjourned part-heard in exceptional circumstances. If, when a case is adjourned part-heard, one of the parties ignores case management orders, it does so at peril as to costs. 32. Accordingly, I order the defendant to pay the costs of the hearing dates set out in the order below on an indemnity basis.Orders1. The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs for the hearing on 25-27 June and subsequent directions dates 9 August, 24 August, 18 September, 4 October, 9 November, 23 November, 11 December 2007 and 15 February 2008 on an indemnity basis.2. Exhibits retained for 28 days.

    2 JAMES J: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    3 BARR J: Sandra Elsie Wiggins seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. On 9 October 2004 she and her fellow offender Gary Carlino carried out a plan to rob a man. The applicant stood by the roadside in Canterbury Road Revesby, pretending to offer sexual services. The complainant, who was driving a van, stopped and spoke to her. She entered the van and directed him to a house where she knew Carlino was waiting. They entered the house and Carlino, brandishing a blood-filled syringe, told the man that they wanted his money. The man began crying and handed over $50. Both offenders told him that they did not wish to hurt him, just take his money. They demanded his bankcard but he persuaded them not to take it. They made him consent to drive them to an ATM to withdraw cash. They got into the complainant’s van. He drove, the applicant sat beside him and Carlino sat behind him. On the way, the complainant said that something had fallen off the van. He stopped and got out, saying that he was going to recover whatever it was. He ran away and got help. When she realised that the complainant had escaped, the applicant drove the van with Carlino in it, to a place where they abandoned it, after removing tools and other items. Some of those things they sold, others they simply threw away. Carlino left a fingerprint on the van.  
     
      
    4 At all material times the applicant and Carlino were living together. They were arrested about 18 months later, on 20 March 2006, presumably because Carlino’s fingerprint had been identified. Both were interviewed. Both admitted the robbery. Carlino then and there stated his intention to plead guilty. The sentencing judge was satisfied that he meant what he said. On sentence, however, the Crown informed the sentencing judge that Carlino acknowledged that he had used a syringe only after being told that the applicant had made an “offer of assistance” in the prosecution of Carlino. This seems to have been understood as an offer to give evidence against Carlino. 
     
      
    5 The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court and maintained her pleas in the District Court. There were two charges, one of taking the complainant without his consent with the intention of obtaining an advantage, namely robbery, and one of robbery while armed with an offensive instrument namely the blood-filled syringe. On the first count Bennett SC DCJ sentenced the applicant to a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of three years and on the second count to a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of two years. The two sentences were ordered to begin on 20 March 2006, the day of the applicant’s arrest, so the effective sentence was one of six years with a non-parole period of three years. In imposing a sentence on the first count his Honour took into account the further offences of taking the van without the consent of the complainant and stealing the goods from the van. 
     
      
    6 For the same two offences, and taking into account the other two offences, his Honour sentenced Carlino on the charge of taking the complainant without consent with the intention of obtaining an advantange to a non-parole period of four years and a balance of term of two years and on the robbery count to a non-parole period of four years and a balance of sentence of three years. Both sentences were ordered to run concurrently, so the effective sentence was one of seven years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years.  
     
      
    7 There was a wealth of evidence before the sentencing judge, including two pre-sentence reports and one report each from a psychiatrist and a psychologist. Neither of those professionals had treated the applicant though they gave a comprehensive description of the events of her life. The applicant was 48 years old at the time of the offences and 50 years old when sentenced. She had had a difficult and sad life as a child. Her parents separated and her father committed suicide. She and her brothers and sisters had been made State wards. She left school at 14 and had done a number of jobs over the years. She was for a time dependent on heroin during her twenties. She had had three domestic relationships and borne five children. She was not close to them, but kept in touch. Her latest relationship, with Carlino, had ended. She was suffering from chronic back pain following a fairground accident in 1997. She was a long-standing abuser of alcohol and other drugs. She had been diagnosed with depression and treated and counselled many times over the years. She had been admitted to psychiatric units after making attempts on her own life. She was cognitively impaired, possibly as a result of her substance abuse. She had a moderate record of offences of dishonesty, mostly in the nineteen eighties. She had not before the present matter been ordered to serve any period of imprisonment.  
     
      
    8 The author of the pre-sentence reports drew attention to her dysfunctional upbringing, her co-dependency on domestic partners, her abuse of alcohol and other drugs and her emotional and health problems as contributing to her behaviour. She was said to be easily led.  
     
      
    9 The applicant claimed, and his Honour accepted, that she had been using amphetamines with Carlino before the commission of the subject offences and was under the influence of that drug at the time. The simple reason for offending was that she and Carlino, who were both recipients of the disability pension, had been to a club and had spent all their money on the poker machines. The applicant needed money to buy medicine to relieve her chronic back pain, so they hatched a plot to rob whomever they could. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge expressly allowed a discount of 35% to take account of the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty, the applicant’s remorse and her preparedness to assist the authorities in the prosecution of Carlino. His Honour expressed the view that there were good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    11 The first ground of appeal asserts that the sentences individually and in combination were manifestly excessive. Counsel drew attention to the guideline judgment in R v Henry and Others [1999] NSWCCA 111, in which this Court spoke of a head sentence of four-five years for a robbery by a young offender with no or little criminal history, using a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury, with a limited degree of planning, if any, no actual violence but a real threat thereof, with a small amount taken from a victim such as shop keeper or a taxi driver in a vulnerable position and a plea of guilty the significance of which was limited by a strong Crown case. The court was also reminded of the observations in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309 at [161], that the plea of guilty referred to in R v Henry must be taken to have been entered late.  
     
      
    12 It was submitted that the offences committed by the applicant were objectively no more serious than those contemplated in R v Henry. As to the use of the syringe, it was submitted that it was subjectively less serious because the applicant’s demeanour was “unusually non-aggressive”. The reference was, I think, to the applicant’s statement that she and Carlino did not wish to hurt the complainant, just take his money. In my opinion that submission should not be accepted. Nothing in the evidence could explain why the complainant drove his van as directed by the applicant and Carlino unless he continued to fear the consequences of disobedience, whatever soothing words the applicant might have uttered. 
     
      
    13 It was submitted that although she was not young, as is the hypothetical offender in R v Henry, her prospects of rehabilitation were good and her personal circumstances and the state of her health gave her at least as strong entitlement as any young offender to leniency. It was submitted that that was especially so since the sentencing judge considered these matters important enough to warrant an adjustment of the sentence components in favour of parole. It was submitted that sentences more lenient than the Henry range have been upheld by this Court where there have been found to be particular rehabilitation or mental health needs. Reference was made to R v Blackman and Walters [2001] NSWCCA 121 and R v Legge [2007] NSWCCA 244. 
     
      
    14 It was submitted that the age, the mental health problems and the medical condition and other subjective circumstances of the applicant justified a sentence less than the range contemplated in R v Henry. Reliance was placed on the conclusion that the robbery was an offence more serious than the taking for advantage, the former having been planned and the latter not so. So if the robbery sentence was excessive by the standards of R v Henry, the sentence on the second count was even more so. 
     
      
    15 I do not accept that the sentence imposed for either offence was outside the range of the sentencing discretion. There are several features that distinguish the case from the R v Henry hypothesis. The planning of the robbery, though not of any complex kind, made it more serious. The part played by the applicant in tricking the complainant and luring him to the place where he would be dealt with was especially reprehensible. 
     
      
    16 While it is true to say that the robbery was the more serious offence, being planned, the subsequent offence, in which the complainant was taken away in fear against his will, was by no means a trivial one. It bore the aggravating feature that it was it done in company. Although it was opportunistic, the applicant played an important part in it, seating herself beside the complainant. Notwithstanding the significant additional criminality, the applicant obtained a substantial benefit in the imposition of the wholly concurrent sentence for the second count.  
     
      
    17 Neither were the taking of the van and its contents trivial matters, and the sentencing judge was obliged to take them into account when fixing the sentence for the first count.  
     
      
    18 The whole of this episode of criminality was entered into for the sole benefit of the applicant, who needed money to buy medicine but had gambled it all away.  
     
      
    19 The applicant was not a person, like the hypothetical offender in R v Henry, having little or no criminal history. Although the applicant’s criminal history was not serious, it was significant and she had been dealt with leniently by the courts a number of times. Moreover, she was at the time of this offence in breach of her bond to be of good behaviour. She had been given the benefit of that bond on 2 February 2004 when she was dealt with in the Local Court for assault. 
     
      
    20 In my opinion the assertion that the sentences fell outside the range of discretion according to R v Henry has not been made good.  
     
      
    21 The second ground of appeal asserted that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance by comparing her sentences with those imposed on Carlino. Carlino was 33 years old at the time of the offences and 36 years old at sentence. The sentencing judge found that he had a history of drug dependency. By the time of sentence he was clean of drugs, a fact accepted by the sentencing judge, and had good prospects of rehabilitation. Like the applicant, he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court at an early stage. The sentencing judge allowed him a discount of 30% for the plea and all the favourable features.  
     
      
    22 Like the applicant, Carlino was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    23 Of course, Carlino had offended for the sole benefit of the applicant. He had used the syringe. The applicant was always present, approving what he did. She sat beside the complainant as he drove his van away in fear. After he managed to get away she took the opportunity to steal the van and drive it away so that she and Carlino could escape detection, a measure which presumably resulted in the long delay before they were arrested. 
     
      
    24 His Honour was bound to and did distinguish between the objective and subjective cases presented by the applicant and Carlino respectively. Those entitling the applicant to a lesser sentence were her preparedness to assist the authorities in the case against Carlino, difficulties with her personal life, particularly the consequences of her mental illness, her dependency on others including, in this case, Carlino, the fact that it was Carlino, not she, who had wielded the syringe, and, perhaps, her somewhat better prospects of rehabilitation. Against that had to be put the important roles played by the applicant in the robbery and in coercing the complainant to drive away his van, her theft of the van and its important consequences for the administration of justice, together with the fact that this whole episode of criminality was entered upon for her benefit alone.  
     
      
    25 Otherwise both offenders fell to be dealt with in much the same way and might have expected to receive similar sentences. It seems to me that the differential sentences imposed by his Honour, the effect of which was that, provided that they progress well during their custody, the applicant may expect to be released to parole one year earlier than Carlino, was unremarkable and was entirely within the range of sentencing discretion. In my opinion this ground of appeal has not been made good.  
     
      
    26 I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

      JUDGMENT 
       – on admissibility of evidence 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application by Notice of Motion filed for the accused that I reject certain evidence that the Crown proposes to lead in the trial of the accused for the murder of his parents. The evidence concerns questioning of the accused by police in the hours shortly after the police learned of the death of the accused’s mother, father and brother on Saturday 28 August 1993. In particular the accused objects to the reception into evidence of that part of the video-recorded questioning (“the ERISP”) that took place after 9.07 on the morning of 28 August and the video-recorded questioning of the accused at his home in what is referred to as “the walk through” that took place at about 4pm that afternoon. 
     
      
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    2 The facts for the purpose of this voir dire hearing are generally uncontentious. Police arrived at the scene of the triple killing at about 4.50am. The accused was sitting on the footpath outside his home that had been set on fire sometime earlier. At some stage he was placed into an ambulance where he was in the company of a neighbour. 
     
      
    3 At about 5am Detective Parsons arrived at the scene. She was on general duty the night before and attended as a result of a broadcast to the vehicle in which she had been travelling. Det Parsons spoke to the accused briefly, trying to ascertain what had happened. During this conversation he informed the officer that his brother told him that he had killed his parents and “lit them”. He also said that he thought he had stabbed his brother and killed him. The detective recorded this conversation as it occurred. She then went into the house. 
     
      
    4 At about 5.35am Detective Ahern arrived. He became the officer in charge of the investigation. Det Parsons told him the import of her conversation with the accused. At some time shortly after 5.30am Det Ahern told certain police to convey the accused to Sutherland Police Station. It was accepted that Det Ahern wanted to question the accused. 
     
      
    5 When he arrived at the police station the accused was placed in the muster room and given a cup of coffee. A police officer was told in effect to keep watch upon him. I accept that at this stage had the accused sought to leave the police station he would have been refused. Further I accept that at this stage Det Ahern suspected that the accused had committed a criminal offence at least in respect of the death of his brother. He had not at that stage determined to charge the accused with any offence but wished to interview him to determine what had happened in the house. 
     
      
    6 Shortly after 8am Det Ahern spoke to the accused in the company of Detective Marks. That short conversation was not electronically recorded. The officer according to his statement asked the accused to tell him what happened. The accused allegedly admitted killing his brother after he had learned that his brother had killed his parents. He was asked if he killed his parents and denied that he did. The accused was asked whether he was agreeable to be interviewed and said that he was. He was then cautioned. 
     
      
    7 The ERISP commenced at 8.22am. The accused was again cautioned. He told police that he was born in 1970 so that he was then aged 23. He was a student studying engineering at university. The accused was questioned at length about the events surrounding the death of his parents and brother. In effect he maintained his version that he had killed his brother upon discovering that his brother had killed his parents and set fire to them. In effect he was claiming that he had been provoked into killing his brother by his brother’s actions in killing his parents. During the course of the questioning the police evinced some disbelief, or at least doubt, about the veracity of the accused’s account. 
     
      
    8 At 9.07am the interview was interrupted when the videotape ejected from the recorder. At that stage the accused had answered about 250 questions. The relevance of this interruption to the arguments placed before me will become obvious later in this judgment. The tape was changed and the interview continued. At questions 451 and 452 the accused was asked whether he would be prepared to accompany police to the house and “indicate certain things to us [where] you were standing and ………where certain things actually occurred”. The accused replied, “Yeah, fine, yeah.” The accused was interviewed by another police officer and made no complaint about the manner in which the interviewing police had questioned him. The interview concluded at 9.51am. 
     
      
    9 The accused remained at the police station. He was examined by a doctor and provided a sample of his blood at about 12.30pm. At the end of the medical examination he again indicated a willingness to accompany police to his home after being warned that he was not obliged to do so. The accused and police went to the house but on learning that the deceased bodies were still in situ it was decided, not unreasonably, to postpone the walk through. The accused was returned to the police station. 
     
      
    10 At about 1pm the accused was formally charged with the murder of his brother. At about 2.52pm the accused was again asked whether he was prepared to accompany police to the house and again informed that he was not obliged to do so. The accused said, “I know. I don’t mind”. 
     
      
    11 At 3.59pm the recording of the walk through commenced and the accused agreed to wear a microphone. It took about half and hour. The accused was then returned to the police station. He was placed before an authorised justice the next morning and was refused bail. 
     
      
       
        
        The evidence 
        
       
      
    12 In evidence before me Det Ahern acknowledged that at the time the tape ejected during the interview he turned his mind to the fact that a bail court would have been sitting in Sydney but considered that he was not required to take the accused to the magistrate at that time because he was in the middle of interviewing him and was investigating all three murders. He believed that he was able lawfully to continue to interview an accused before taking him before a court in order to determine what, if any charge, was to be laid before the court. Detective Marks also gave evidence. 
     
      
    13 Evidence was called on behalf of the accused that on Saturday 28 August 1993 bail courts were sitting both in the Central Local Court and at Parramatta. I accept that at 9am there was a bail court to which the accused could have been taken. It is probable that a duty solicitor would have appeared for him and made a bail application. I also accept that had the accused raised with the solicitor the fact that the police were seeking to further interview him, he would have informed the accused of his right to silence and that no inference could be drawn against him if he exercised that right. 
     
      
    14 At some time in the morning, roughly about 9.30am a friend of the Gilham family, Ms Patterson, attended at the police station asking after the welfare of the accused. She spoke to uniformed police at the front desk. She explained that she was not a member of the family but asked if she could see the accused. She was told that she could not as he was helping them with their inquiries. She asked whether he needed a lawyer and they said he did not. There is no evidence that Det Ahern was ever made aware of this event. 
     
      
       
       
       
        
        A. The recorded interview 
        
       
      
    15 I am prepared to find on the balance of probabilities that after 9.07am, when the tape ejected from the recorder, the accused was being held in illegal custody: he was being detained merely for questioning and not to take him before a court. The common law relevant at the time was that the police officer was required to take a person in custody before a court without unreasonable delay; that is as soon as it was reasonably practicable to do so: Williams v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 278 per Mason and Brennan JJ at 295, 300-301, per Wilson and Dawson JJ at 306. Section 352 of the Crimes Act 1900 (now repealed) was read in accordance with the common law and gave a police officer no power to detain a person simply for questioning: Foster v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 550. 
     
      
    16 By 9.07am it was reasonably practicable to take the accused before a justice then sitting at Central Local Court. The police had sufficient evidence to charge him with the murder of his brother and had reached the conclusion that they would charge him with that offence. True it was that they were still investigating the deaths of his parents and had not determined whether to charge him with those deaths. But that did not permit them detaining him in order to investigate those deaths rather than to take him before a justice on the charge of murdering his brother. Had they done so, they could have sought to further interview him in relation to the death of his parents. 
     
      
    17 I do not accept that Det Ahern had any other motive in failing to take the accused before a justice other than to continue the interview in which the accused was voluntarily involved in order to complete his investigation of the death of the parents. Although the officer may have hoped that the accused would confess to the killing of his parents as well as his brother, I do not accept that he continued the interview for the purpose of obtaining a confession by withholding the accused from appearing before a justice. Nor did he continue the interview in order to deprive the accused of legal advice. He did not continue the detention of the accused in order to exert pressure upon him in the hope of obtaining a confession to the killing of his parents. 
     
      
    18 The accused did not give evidence before me. There is no evidence of his state of mind at the time preceding, or during, the interview other than that to be obtained from his recorded conversations with police. He appears to be prepared to be interviewed in order to give his account of the events in the house and, in particular, to exculpate himself from the killing of his parents. There is no evidence that he wished to speak with a lawyer or any other person before being interviewed. He appears to be a mature and intelligent adult quite capable of answering police questions even where they express doubts about his veracity. The interview was video-recorded and there is nothing in it that indicates to the contrary of what I have just stated. The fact that he was quite prepared at all times to remain in police custody to participate in the walk through interview and to cooperate with other police investigations that day is consistent with this attitude. 
     
      
       
        
        The balancing of interests 
        
       
      
    19 The fact that part of the ERISP was obtained while the police were unlawfully detaining the accused engages s 138 of the Evidence Act (“the Act”). Under that section the court has a discretion to admit the evidence notwithstanding that it was unlawfully obtained. The discretion is in the form of a judgment involving the balancing of competing considerations to determine whether “the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting the evidence obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained”. The section sets out a number of matters that the court is to take into account in forming that judgment. Clearly it is for the Crown to satisfy me that I should admit the part of the interview to which objection has been taken. 
     
      
    20 It should be understood that the court takes seriously the deprivation of the liberty of an individual however well intentioned the actions of the police might have been or however reasonable they might have appeared to be at the time. The importance of bringing an end to investigative procedures within a police station as soon as practicable so that the court might take control of the arrested person and the proceedings against him has been stressed in decided cases and is obvious for various reasons, not the least being to permit the person to seek his liberty from a judicial officer. 
     
      
    21 No doubt the longer the illegal imprisonment, the more serious is the denial of the accused’s rights. The effect of the unlawful custody upon the person is also an important consideration under this and other sections of the Act. As I have indicated, there is nothing to suggest that the period of custody before 9.07am had any deleterious effect upon the accused whatsoever. Nothing in the period of the interview after 9.07am and before 9.51am led to any change in the accused’s attitude to police or his willingness to co-operate in order to give his account of the circumstances surrounding the killings. 
     
      
    22 The section requires the court to consider the way in which the evidence was obtained. Clearly the more egregious the illegality or the impropriety accompanying the obtaining of the evidence, the more likely it is that the balance will fall in favour of the exclusion of the evidence. In my opinion the period of the unlawful custody between 9.07am when the interview is interrupted and the conclusion of the interview about 50 minutes later was of the most technical nature. It is most improbable in the extreme that had the police abandoned the interview when it was interrupted and taken steps to have the accused charged and considered by a bail sergeant and then transported him to Central Local Court that he would have been before the magistrate before 9.51am. I accept that by acting illegally the police obtained the opportunity to continue interviewing the accused but their conduct had no adverse affect upon the contents of the interview including any admissions that were made thereafter. The illegality of the detention has to be viewed against the treatment of the accused during the detention, his willingness to be interviewed by the police, and his willingness to remain in police custody in order to accompany them to the home for the walk through interview. 
     
      
    23 The police acted illegally by further detaining the accused after the interview was concluded but that has no bearing upon the question whether the balance of the interview should be admitted. The further detention was understandable because the accused had indicated his preparedness to take part in the walk through interview at the house. In the very unusual circumstances of this case it is quite understandable that the police would have wished to have the accused explain his version at the site of the killings. Although one could be excused for being sceptical about an explanation offered by police for their illegal activity that they were trying to be fair to the accused, I am prepared to accept that the police were offering the accused an opportunity to explain his account at the scene even though they were unconvinced of the truthfulness of his account and were hoping that he might admit to killing his parents. 
     
      
    24 It is significant in the present case that at the time of the interview the procedure to be adopted by police in detaining and interrogating suspects was set out in the Police Commissioner’s Instructions. These had no force of law and the fact that a police officer acted in accordance with the Instructions would not mean that there was no illegality attaching to the conduct. But they are relevant when one comes to consider the state of mind of the police officer. 
     
      
    25 The relevant part of the Instruction was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Questioning after arrest 
         
         
        You do not have a general power to detain a citizen merely to question that person. 
         
         
        Bring an arrested person before a justice without unreasonable delay. 
         
         
        In determining what is an unreasonable delay allowance maybe had to the making of a decision to prefer a charge or not. In making this decision it may only be fair to question the arrested person and conduct inquiries to confirm or dispel the suspicion on which the arrest was based. 
         
         
        When a person does not wish to be questioned, do not persist. 
         
         
        When asking questions, it is proper to anticipate defences which may be raised. Accordingly, be conscious to obtain evidence which may negative them eg., evidence to rebut an alibi or evidence of similar acts. 
         
         
        Questioning and inquiries, provided they are directed to, confirming or dispelling the suspicion on which the arrest was based, may therefore be occasioned by a number of factors, including: 
         
        
       
      
    · geographical considerations

    · the proper assessment of material relevant to conducting an interview 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
          
         
        
       
      
    · the necessity to seek legal advice on framing the correct charge

    · the necessity to conduct procedures authorised under S.353A of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    26 It will be obvious that these Instructions are inconsistent with the approach of the majority of the judges in Williams and are inconsistent with a requirement that there be no delay in taking a suspect before a magistrate in order to carry out an investigation of the offence for which the person was arrested or any other offence notwithstanding that such investigations might be reasonable. The Instructions might find support in the judgment of Gibbs CJ but his Honour was in the minority. However on the basis of the Instructions the conduct of Det Ahern in continuing the interview after it was interrupted at 9.07am was fully justified. 
     
      
    27 It cannot be gainsaid that the proceedings before me are of the utmost seriousness, being the prosecution of the accused for two counts of murder. This is one of the matters to be taken into account in determining whether to admit the second part of the interview: see s 138(3)(c) of the Act. 
     
      
    28 The evidence is important because the Crown’s case is that the accused did not tell the police the truth in the interview about the events surrounding the killing of his parents: see s 138(3)(b) of the Act. The Crown case is a circumstantial one in which it seeks to prove that the accused’s account given in the record of interview as a whole is not true. If the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the version given by the accused is false, rather than simply inaccurate, then it must follow that the accused killed his mother and father because, on the Crown case, there is no other reasonable explanation open. As I understand the situation, the Crown intends to lead evidence that would point to the same person killing all three persons. But that evidence is not so powerful that it might itself satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt of the accused’s guilt.  
     
      
    29 To a significant extent the importance of the evidence and its probative value are connected in this case: see s 138(3)(a) of the Act. The defence argues that most of what is contained in the second part of the interview is referred to in the first part. That might be so, but it is obvious that the Crown case or its arguments are strengthened by additional material in the second part of the interview in which the accused elaborates on what is contained in the first part of the interview. The force of the Crown’s argument, that what the accused said to the police is either inherently unbelievable or can be proved by other evidence to be false, would be substantially lessened in my view by the rejection of the second part of the interview. 
     
      
    30 I am of the opinion that it is impossible to consider the probative value of any particular piece of evidence contained in the second part of the interview in isolation or by simply having regard to what was said in the first part of the interview. As I have indicated, the Crown will be asking the jury to consider the accused’s account as a whole, even though it may place more weight on one particular part of the account than another. It will be asking the jury to find that there is no other reasonable possibility open other than the account is generally false and, therefore, it must follow that he killed his parents as well as his brother. 
     
      
    31 I accept that some part of the second interview may have insufficient relevance and should be rejected, but under s 137 or s 135 of the Act rather than under s 138. I have already indicated that questions 411 to 449 are rejected on the basis that their relevance is outweighed by the prejudice that would flow from the manner in which police, who were apparently under a misapprehension of what the accused was saying, questioned the accused. There may be other specific questions and answers that ought not to be in evidence for reasons other than that portion of the interview in which they occur was obtained while the accused was in illegal detention. 
     
      
    32 I have already referred generally to the gravity of the impropriety; see s 138(3)(d). It is always a serious infringement of a person’s liberty to fail to take the person before a court but rather to hold the person in police custody in breach of the law. But not all illegal detentions should be considered to have the same seriousness notwithstanding the condemnation that attaches to the unlawful infringement of the liberty of any citizen. As I have already indicated the period of the illegal detention here was for a relatively short period of time, about 50 minutes. I accept that the accused probably thought that he was being detained, but it was not against his will and there is no evidence that the illegal detention had any relevance to the contents of the interview. Other than being detained there is not the slightest evidence to suggest that the accused was in any way mistreated in the period of his detention while the interview was completed. 
     
      
    33 The fact that the illegal period of detention follows a period of about four hours while the accused was being held at the police station does not seem to me to greatly change the situation. There is no evidence that the accused wished to leave the police station or even believed that he was being detained at the police station during that period. I have no doubt that he went with the police willingly from the scene and was prepared to wait for the opportunity to give his account of the events to police. 
     
      
    34 Det Ahern made a conscious decision not to take the accused before a justice when the interview was interrupted at 9.07am. But I have no doubt that he believed that he was permitted to continue the interview at that time. It was open to him to hold that view in light of the width of the police Instructions. There is no evidence that he knew those Instructions did not accurately reflect the law. It was reasonable for him to complete the interview in light of the Commissioner’s Instructions and having regard to the fact that he was still determining whether to charge the accused with the murder of his parents. It is important to note that the circumstances surrounding the three deaths were intertwined arising as they did from a single event yet it did not follow, that because the accused might have committed one of the killings, he did or did not commit the other two. Although the detective intentionally took a course that breached the law in deciding not to take the accused before a court, he did not deliberately act illegally because he was unaware that he was breaching the law. Rather he believed that he was not acting illegally. He was neither negligent nor reckless in respect of the accused’s rights and his breach of them: see s 138(3)(f) of the Act. 
     
      
    35 Generally speaking the detention of the accused after 9.07am was in breach of clause 1 of Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. 
        
       
       
      The accused was deprived of his liberty in breach of the procedure established by law.  
       
      
    36 However clause 3 relevantly states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release………….. 
        
       
      
    37 The word “promptly” has to be considered against the particular circumstances of the case and the availability of a court to receive the arrested person. Even if the delay of an hour breached the clause, it was not in my opinion a serious breach of the Covenant. 
     
      
    38 There is no likelihood of any proceedings being taken in relation to the illegality: s 138(3)(g) of the Act. Det Ahern is no longer an active police officer. In any event the illegality was not such that it would be likely to attract a court’s attention to either vindicate the accused’s rights or denunciate the police conduct. But it seems to me of less importance in the present case for this Court to send a message to other police officers that such conduct will not be tolerated and might result in the rejection of evidence. At the time of these events there was frustration experienced by police officers that the common law was unreasonably interfering with investigations of serious crime. That should no longer be the case because the procedures for arrest and interrogation have since been regulated and police have a limited period of detention for investigation and questioning.  
     
      
    39 Finally I take into account that the evidence might have been obtained without any illegality by taking the accused before a magistrate and then seeking to have him further questioned. There is however an air of unreality in such a procedure in light of the fact that the police were in the course of lawfully interviewing the accused when the illegality arose. 
     
      
    40 I accept that minds might legitimately differ in exercising the judgment required by the section. However, I am firmly of the view that the balance in the present case is overwhelmingly in favour of allowing the whole of the recorded interview notwithstanding the illegality of the further detention of the accused after 9.07am to complete the interview. 
     
      
       
        
        Section 85 and unreliability 
        
       
      
    41 It was argued that I should reject the second half of the interview on the basis that I would not be satisfied that the circumstances in which the admissions were made were such that it was unlikely that the truth of the admissions were adversely affected. 
     
      
    42 This is a somewhat curious argument. Admissions in this case are statements made by the accused that the Crown are intending to use to prove his guilt of the killing of his parents by persuading the jury that they are not true: see R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426. Of course the accused steadfastly denied being responsible for the death of his parents and stated repeatedly that his brother killed them. The accused will be arguing that what he told the police was in fact true. Yet I am being asked to reject his exculpatory statements on the basis that I would not be satisfied that it was unlikely that the truth of the statements was adversely affected. 
     
      
    43 As I understand the argument, it is submitted that the manner in which the police questioned the accused during the second part of the interview undermined the reliability of what he was saying so that unwittingly he might have given an answer or answers which he did not intend and which were not strictly true. It was submitted the Crown then might rely upon these inconsistencies in a way that would result in an unfair trial for the accused.  
     
      
    44 As I have indicated, there is no evidence from the accused before me on this voir dire. It is not apparent to me that the argument is made out simply on the face of the interview. In any event the Crown eschewed that any significant part of its case consisted of inconsistencies in answers, rather it was relying upon statements which it would convince the jury were inherently impossible or which could be proved by other evidence to be untrue. 
     
      
    45 I am not persuaded that s 85 has been engaged. 
     
      
    46 Finally it was submitted that I should reject the evidence under s 90 of the Act. This is a section that permits a court to reject evidence of an admission if, having regard to the circumstances in which it was made, it would be unfair to use the evidence against the accused. It is the unfairness in the use of the evidence rather than unfairness in the obtaining of the evidence that is the focus of the section: Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; 81 ALJR 1896 per Gummow and Hayne JJ at [107]. 
     
      
    47 In Em Gleeson CJ and Heydon J, in a joint judgment, pointed out at [56] that the section was “likely to be highly fact-specific”. The accused bears the onus of establishing the basis for rejecting the evidence and it is significant that he has given no evidence before me as to his state of mind at the time of the interview or how any of the conduct of the police impacted upon him such that it might be unfair to use the evidence against him. Of course the court in a particular case can draw certain inferences notwithstanding the absence of evidence from the accused, but this is not such a case. From what I can see in the record of interview the accused was prepared, if not anxious, to give his account which exculpated him from the killing of his parents. 
     
      
    48 The reliability of the evidence is a relevant factor; see EM at [73] and [111]. There is nothing that indicates that any conduct of the police or the circumstances in which the interview was taken affected the reliability of answers given by the accused. 
     
      
    49 Gummow and Hayne JJ indicated that the section would be engaged when none of the other sections of the Act operated to exclude the evidence. At [109] their Honours wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “When it is ""unfair"" to use evidence of an out-of-court admission at the trial of an accused person cannot be described exhaustively. ""Unfairness"", whether for the purposes of the common law discretion or for the purposes of s 90, may arise in different ways. But many cases in which the use of evidence of an out-of-court admission would be judged, in the exercise of the common law discretion, to be unfair to an accused are dealt with expressly by particular provisions of the Act other than s 90. Thus although the discretion given by s 90 is generally similar to the common law discretion considered in Lee, it is a discretion that will fall to be considered only after applying the other, more specific, provisions of the Act referred to at the start of these reasons. The questions with which those other sections deal (most notably questions of the reliability of what was said to police or other persons in authority, and what consequences follow from illegal or improper conduct by investigating authorities)” 
        
       
       
      They later described it as “a safety net which catches a residuary category of cases not expressly dealt with elsewhere in the Act, where use of the evidence at trial would be unfair………”; at [114]. 
       
      
    50 I am quite unable to see how the failure of the police to take the accused before a justice at 9.07am results in unfairness to the accused at his trial by the introduction of the balance of the recorded interview that was interrupted at that time by the tape being ejected from the recorder. I think with respect that Mr Boulton SC who appears for the accused conceded as much. 
     
      
       
        
        The evidence of the walk through 
        
       
      
    51 As I have already noted the police took the accused to the house shortly after the completion of the ERISP in order to record a conversation with him while they walked through the premises. I am satisfied that the accused went with them voluntarily in order to explain the circumstances surrounding the killings. It was in my opinion reasonable for the police to take this course and, apart from this issue of his illegal detention, it would have been completely justified. Because the bodies were still present in the house the police returned to the station. 
     
      
    52 At 1.00pm the accused was charged with the murder of his brother. At that time there was no justice available before whom the accused could be taken. The bail officer at the police station refused bail. There was no evidence that the police waited to charge the accused until a time when the bail court had ceased sitting. 
     
      
    53 At sometime in the afternoon, possibly about 3pm, Ms Patterson returned to the police station. She again spoke to uniform police at the front desk and received the same response; that she could not see the accused. She gave evidence that she then asked to see the officer in charge and eventually Det Ahern spoke to her. She explained who she was and asked if she could see the accused. She was told she could not. She asked if the accused needed a lawyer and she was told, “No”. Ms Patterson had made a statement giving her account of the events in 1993 only two weeks before the voir dire hearing. She said that she could not remember the conversation with Det Ahern but she had the feeling that its effect was that the accused could not have a lawyer. 
     
      
    54 Det Ahern gave evidence that he could not recall meeting Ms Patterson. 
     
      
    55 I am prepared to accept that Ms Patterson did speak to Det Ahern and that some conversation occurred about a lawyer that was to the effect that it was unnecessary for the accused to have one. I am also prepared to accept that, if such a conversation occurred, it was improper for the detective to convey the impression that a suspect, who was in police custody and was to be further interrogated for three murders, did not need to consult a lawyer. I can only assume that the impropriety was at least reckless. Of course the accused had not asked for a lawyer but he was not asked whether he wanted to seek legal advice. The fact that he was not asked whether he wished to consult a lawyer was not improper conduct by the police in 1993 but that failure is relevant to a consideration of the police conduct in relation to the inquiry made by Ms Patterson. 
     
      
       
        
        Illegality of the walk through 
        
       
      
    56 A question arose before me as to whether at the time of the walk through the accused was in illegal detention. Counsel for the accused quite properly brought to my attention the decision of the High Court in Michaels v The Queen [1995] HCA 8; 184 CLR 117. The case concerned the status of a person in custody of police at the time he escaped from that custody. The question was whether his custody was lawful: if it was not he had not committed an offence in escaping. The appellant argued that he was not in lawful custody because there had been undue delay in taking him before a justice or because he was being detained for questioning. 
     
      
    57 However the Court held that an unlawful detention could become lawful if circumstances changed. In the case being considered by the High Court, even if the detention had been unlawful at the time of his detention and questioning, it became lawful when the police determined to take him before a magistrate without further delay. It was as if the person had been let free and then immediately rearrested. The second arrest would have been lawful as was the subsequent detention in order only to take him before a justice. Therefore the offence of escape lawful custody had been made out. 
     
      
    58 In the present case at the time of the walk through the accused had been charged with the murder of his brother. He was being detained in order that he could be taken before a justice the next morning when a bail court was sitting. There was no impropriety or illegality only in the fact that the police intended to further question the accused while waiting to take him before a magistrate. It was never suggested to Det Ahern that after charging the accused he was being detained other than to take him before a justice as soon as one was available. 
     
      
    59 The custody of the accused was lawful at least from 1.30pm. Therefore there was nothing illegal in questioning the accused at the walk through. However s 138 is concerned with evidence that was illegally obtained or was obtained “in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law”. The scope of the section in this regard has been considered in two somewhat conflicting decisions of judges of this Court. In DPP v Carr [2002] NSWSC 194; 127 A Crim R 151 Smart AJ held that a magistrate was right to dismiss charges, including that of assaulting a police officer, in circumstances where the assault resulted from an improper use of the power of arrest. His Honour held that the evidence of the assault was obtained as a consequence of an impropriety being that the police should not have arrested the person. 
     
      
    60 In DPP v Coe [2003] NSWSC 363 Adams J rejected an argument that a magistrate could refuse to admit evidence of an offence of assault on a police officer under s 138 on the basis that the police officer had acted unlawfully in arresting a third person. In effect Adams J held that the evidence of the assault was not “obtained” in consequence of an impropriety or illegal act within the meaning of the section. He was of the view that something more than a causal link or “trigger” between the illegal act and the obtaining of the evidence was needed. Adams J felt constrained to disagree with the view taken of the section by Smart AJ. 
     
      
    61 If it were necessary to do so, I would favour the view of the section taken by Adams J but the issue was not fully argued before me. However, I am prepared to find for present purposes that the evidence of the walk through was obtained as a consequence of the earlier illegality in not taking the accused before a justice at some stage prior to 12pm when a justice was available. But the fact that the accused was in lawful custody at the time of the walk through is a matter to be considered when having regard to the nature of the illegality as a consequence of which the evidence was obtained. 
     
      
    62 The accused was illegally detained for a period of at most three hours. I do not know the nature of his detention during that time. About an hour of it was taken up in the balance of the interview and further time was expended in going with the police to the house in the aborted attempt to have the walk through. There is no suggestion that he was handcuffed when he left the police station when he first went to the house. He was not under any physical restrain during the videoed walk through at about 4pm. Where he was held in the meantime and under what conditions, I am unaware. Again there is no evidence that the accused knew he was illegally detained or that he was in any way unwilling to remain in police custody while they investigated his account. There is no suggestion that his detention in any way affected his behaviour or his mental state at any time before, or during, the walk through. 
     
      
    63 I have already indicated my view that the accused was anxious to have his version of events made known to the police because it exculpated him of the killing of his parents. I have no doubt that he was more than happy to attend the house with the police even after he had been charged with the murder of his brother. He was well aware that he did not have to participate in the walk through or any further questioning by police after the conclusion of the ERISP. 
     
      
    64 The discretionary considerations in determining whether to admit the evidence of the walk through based upon it being obtained as a consequence of his prior unlawful detention are very much the same as apply when considering the balance of the ERISP so far as the nature of the proceedings, the probative value of the evidence and its importance in the prosecution case are concerned. It is very much a continuation of the earlier interview because the police gave the accused the opportunity of explaining at the site what he had told them in the ERISP. Its probative value is very much interwoven with the ERISP and the circumstantial nature of the Crown case. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    65 I accept that Det Ahern believed that he was entitled to conduct the walk through. The Police Commissioner’s Instructions on re-interviewing a person after charge were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        After a person has been charged, that person shall be questioned in respect of such charge only in exceptional circumstances (after cautioning) when; 
         
        
       
      
    · such questions are necessary for the purpose of preventing or minimising harm or loss to some other person or the public 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · they are for the purpose of recovering property or in respect of new or fresh matters. 
     
      
    66 Although the Instructions did not cover the situation that confronted Det Ahern, it is quite understandable that he would ask the accused after charging him whether he was still prepared to participate in the walk through that had to be deferred because the bodies had been still in situ at the time the walk through had initially been attempted, which was at a time before the accused was charged. Although the further questioning was not in accordance with the Instructions it does not in my view in the circumstances of this matter make it improper. As I have already indicated, it was not illegal. I take into account that at the time of the walk through the accused had effectively been in the custody of police for about 11 hours, but there is nothing to indicate that the period of his custody in any way affected the accused or the reliability of his account. 
     
      
    67 I have myself watched the recording of the walk through. The police acted fairly in the questioning of the accused. The accused appears fully at ease during the walk through and is making every attempt to explain his version to the police by indicating where things were located and what happened at certain places. The balance under s 138(3) is in my mind overwhelmingly in favour of admitting the evidence. 
     
      
    68 Of more concern is the conduct of Det Ahern in informing Ms Patterson that the accused did not need a solicitor. That was improper in circumstances where the accused had been charged with the murder of his brother and the police intended to interview him at the walk through about that matter and the killing of his parents. Det Ahern agreed that, had this conversation taken place, it would have been improper. 
     
      
    69 However the accused had never sought the assistance of a solicitor or asked to contact any person outside the police station at any time during the period of his custody. There is no evidence that he believed that he could not do so or was prevented by the police from seeking to do so. He appears to be an intelligent and mature young man who was not in any way affected by his detention or the questioning by police. As I have remarked a number of times, he appears keen to fully explain his account of the killings and on at least three occasions indicated his willingness to accompany police for the walk through notwithstanding being advised that he was not required to do so. 
     
      
    70 I do not know what would have happened had the police officer not given the answer to Ms Patterson that he did. It is a matter of pure conjecture. But I doubt that the evidence of the walk through was obtained as a consequence of the impropriety in the detective telling Ms Patterson that the accused did not need a solicitor. 
     
      
    71 However, if I accept that s 138 is engaged, the impropriety does not seem to me to be of such a nature, given all of the circumstances of this particular matter, that it outweighs the other considerations in favour of admitting the evidence when forming the judgment under s 138(3). There is no suggestion that the admission of the walk through would be unfair within the scope of s 90 of the Act. There is no other reason that I can see or that has been suggested to me for excluding the evidence. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
      
    72 The application to exclude part of the ERISP and the evidence of the walk through is refused.

      20416/04 MATTHEW LIDDLE v MICHAEL ANDREW TWOHIG 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 The plaintiff suffered serious injuries in a motor vehicle accident which occurred at approximately 6.50 pm on 1 December 2002. The accident occurred at the intersection of Sutherland and Kethel Roads, Cheltenham, New South Wales, when the plaintiff’s Kawasaki ZZR 250 cc motorcycle collided with the defendant’s manual Mazda 323 sedan. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff alleges the accident and his resultant injuries were caused by the negligence of the defendant. The defendant has denied liability and alleges the plaintiff’s injuries were caused or contributed to by the plaintiff’s own negligence. 
     
      
    3 There were no witnesses to the accident and there is a conflict between the parties as to what occurred. The damages recoverable in the event the plaintiff is wholly successful in his action have been agreed between the parties. The issues for the determination of the Court are liability and, if necessary, contributory negligence. 
     
      
       
      The locale 
       
      
    4 Sutherland Road, in the vicinity of Kethel Road, runs east-west. Kethel Road forms a T junction on the northern side of Sutherland Road. There is a crest in Sutherland Road approximately 180 metres west of the Kethel Road intersection, from where Sutherland Road proceeds downhill at a gradient of about 11.5 percent to the lowest point, being a short distance west of the intersection. Sutherland Road then proceeds uphill at a gradient of about 17 percent to a crest approximately 40 or 50 metres east of the intersection. Sutherland Road is straight between the two crests and, in daylight, there is a clear view of the intersection for motorists proceeding east once they reach the western crest. 
     
      
    5 The surface of Sutherland Road is bitumen sealed. Generally it is approximately 7.2 metres wide and divided into two traffic lanes, one in each direction, by continuous double white barrier lines. There is a break in the barrier lines, about 12 metres long, opposite the mouth of Kethel Road. The northern side of Sutherland Road between the western crest and the intersection is kerbed and guttered. 
     
      
    6 In the vicinity of the intersection the eastbound lane widens to form a second lane which is separated from the original eastbound lane by a single broken white line. The additional eastbound lane commences approximately 90 metres before the intersection and does not continue on the eastern side thereof. The single broken white line ceases just before the western kerb of Kethel Road. 
     
      
    7 In the vicinity of the intersection the westbound lane widens to include an auxiliary lane to cater for traffic turning right into Kethel Road. The auxiliary lane is separated from the westbound lane by a single broken white line. The auxiliary lane commences approximately 15 metres east of the intersection and ends approximately 80 metres beyond it. 
     
      
    8 In the immediate vicinity of the impact location the eastbound portion of the carriageway is 4.15 metres wide. The westbound portion of the carriageway is 6.9 metres wide. 
     
      
    9 The southern side of Sutherland Road leads to a railway reserve and was heavily vegetated. On the northern side the land use comprised low density housing. 
     
      
    10 Kethel Road runs generally north-south and is approximately eight metres wide though it widens at the mouth of the intersection to about 23.3 metres. The intersection is controlled by a combination of stop signs and stop control lines for vehicles entering Sutherland Road. 
     
      
    11 There was a speed limit of 50 km/h. The accident occurred in daylight. The weather at the time was fine and the road surface dry. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of the plaintiff 
       
      
    12 The plaintiff was born on 7 August 1976. He obtained his car driver’s licence in August 1993 and his motorcycle licence in November 2001.  
     
      
    13 On 21 December 2002 Police Constable Lang interviewed the plaintiff at Royal North Shore Hospital. The constable recorded in his notebook that the plaintiff said the following in response to the question “What happened?”:  
     
      
       
        
        “At about 6.50 pm on 1/12/2002 I was riding motor cycle WXH 82 south along Sutherland Road, Cheltenham at about 60 km/h when I saw a red motor vehicle two-thirds through a ‘U’ turn but still in Kethel Street. As I approached the red vehicle it kept on coming out of Kethel Street. I collided with the front right mudguard area of the car. I don’t remember much of the accident but remember laying on the road.” 
        
       
       
      The entry was signed by the plaintiff. 
       
      
    14 A MACA claim form dated 21.1.03 described the accident in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Because of serious injury memory of accident not complete. However I know that I was riding my motorcycle down hill along Sutherland Road in a south-easterly direction when a red car appeared from Kethel Street on my left and drove across my path.” 
        
       
       
      It was common ground that the writing in that document was that of the plaintiff’s father.  
       
      
    15 In his evidence in chief the plaintiff gave the following version of events: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. When you reached the crest [the last crest west of the intersection], crossed it and began the downhill run towards the place where the accident happened, did you see any vehicles coming towards you?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. Did you see any other vehicles on the roadway at all?  
         
        A. There was a red car in front of me.  
         
         
        Q. Were you able to identify its model from what you saw, or was it not a model you were familiar with?  
         
        A. Oh, I don't recognise it from then but if I, I do know what type of car it is now obviously, but I didn't at the time.  
         
         
        Q. Well, where was the red car when you first remember seeing it and what did it appear to you to be doing?  
         
        A. Okay. The red car was down on the left-hand side partially in Kethel Street about two thirds of the way through a U-turn.  
         
         
        Q. What do you mean by two thirds of a way through a U-turn? Describe its position, its angle, its movement?  
         
        A. Okay. I clearly remember the car being, you can see it from the photographs that there is the straight ahead bit which if you continue in the lane you can go up the hill, there is the left-hand bit of the lane. I remember seeing the car poking its nose - I apologise for using my hands - but poking its nose into Kethel and then swinging around and so it was two thirds he was, probably its nose was probably coming a bit out of Kethel.  
         
         
        Q. And was the vehicle in motion?  
         
        A. Oh, yes.  
         
         
        Q. When you saw the vehicle in motion with its nose just pointing out of Kethel what, if anything, did you do on your motorcycle?  
         
        A. Okay. I moved my motorbike to the right-hand part of the road.  
         
         
        Q. How were the lanes separated? How was the west bound traffic separated from east bound?  
         
        A. Double unbroken lines down the middle of the road, so I moved my motorbike to the right-hand side of that.  
         
         
        Q. What, the traffic lane?  
         
        A. Yes, I apologise, the traffic lane. So I would have been very close to the double white lines.  
         
         
        Q. Yes?  
         
        A. I assumed the vehicle would stop coming so I continued travelling.  
         
         
        Q. Did the vehicle stop coming?  
         
        A. No, it didn't.  
         
         
        Q. Well, as you drew close to it as far as you can recall did it still continue to come?  
         
        A. Yes, it did.  
         
         
        Q. Do you recall now what, if anything, you did about your own speed?  
         
        A. I believe I, I believe I tried to brake but my memory of that part of the collision is incomplete.  
         
         
        Q. And what is the last thing you remember seeing before the impact?  
         
        A. I just have this vision of a red flash, so my whole vision filled up with this red.  
         
         
        Q. Do you recall the impact itself?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. Do you remember flying through the air? 
         
        A. No.”  
        
       
      
    16 The plaintiff knew that the speed limit in the area was 50 km/h. He gave evidence that he was riding at that speed as he reached the western crest. However the speed of the motorcycle increased to 60 km/h by reason of the downhill slope after the crest. He did not accelerate and the engine retardation effect would have prevented the motorcycle from going any faster than 60 km/h. 
     
      
    17 In cross examination: 
     
      
       
      (a) The plaintiff affirmed that he had seen the car “poking its nose into Kethel”. He said he told Constable Lang of this observation but accepted no reference to it was contained in the entry signed by him in the police notebook.  
       
       
      (b) He said he could not say how far down the hill he was when he saw the car moving to the left but approximated that position to the position from which a photograph tendered in evidence was taken. 
       
       
      (c) He said he did not have a specific memory of seeing the car before that but imagined it would have been within his view from the moment he got to the crest. 
       
       
      (d) He was asked to accept that the photograph was taken 150 metres west of the intersection. He gave the following evidence: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. If it be the case that when you saw the red vehicle two-thirds through a U-turn, but still in Kethel Street, you were about 150 metres away, then the accident could not have happened in the way you describe, could it, because the vehicle would be well and truly on to the other side of the road long before you got to the intersection?  
           
          A. I don't agree with that, it would depend at what speed the vehicle was travelling… 
           
           
          Q. At 60 kilometres an hour how long did you take to cover 150 metres?  
           
          A. About nine seconds.  
           
           
          Q. Ample time, you would agree, for any car poking its nose out of Kethel Street to either do a right hand turn or a U-turn, whichever it was doing, would you agree?  
           
          A. If the vehicle had moved off when I was nine seconds away, yes.  
           
           
          Q. Ample time for you to travel, for instance, to the left of the vehicle?  
           
          A. You couldn't travel to the left of the vehicle.  
           
           
          Q. Why not?  
           
          A. Because the left hand lane, the slip lane down the left hand side sort of ends up - if you kept going you would hit the bank as it was going up the hill.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (e) He gave evidence as follows: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You saw the vehicle do the flick around you have talked to us about?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. And proceed across in a more or less north south direction in front of you?  
           
          A. No, I don't recall it going in front of me.  
           
           
          Q. What do you last recall?  
           
          A. My very last recollection is that flash of red.  
           
           
          Q. And before that?  
           
          A. The last clear recollection I have is where that position of the vehicle where I said where its nose was just out of Kethel.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (f) He said that the description of the accident in the claim form was “similar, it is a reasonable summary in some ways”. 
       
       
      (g) He denied he was travelling in excess of 60 km/h. 
       
       
      (h) He gave the following evidence: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. If when you first saw the vehicle two-thirds of the way through a U-turn it would be heading at least partly to the west, wouldn't it?  
           
          A. No, that's what I meant by two-thirds of the way through is what I have, where I have drawn the Mazda on that diagram.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       On the diagram (Exhibit 1) the plaintiff had placed the car on the eastern side of Kethel Road at an angle to the kerb in Sutherland Road and with the offside front barely protruding into Sutherland Road. The diagram was not to scale 
       
       
      (i) In re-examination the plaintiff said that the conversation with Constable Lang was not limited to what the officer wrote down in his notebook. He gave the following evidence: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Incidentally had you spoken with anybody else about how this accident may or may not have happened up to the time that you spoke with Constable Lang?  
           
          A. No, absolutely not. 
           
           
          Q. So was he the first person that you had spoken to about how the accident happened?  
           
          A. Yes.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The evidence of the defendant 
       
      
    18 The defendant was born on 21 July 1985. He was a school student at the time of the accident. He had obtained his provisional driver’s licence in July 2002.  
     
      
    19 The defendant was interviewed by Constable Lang at the scene. The constable recorded in his notebook that the defendant said, in response to the question “What happened?”: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 6.50 pm on 1/12/2002 I was driving a red Mazda, rego TXL 553 south on Sutherland Road, Cheltenham near the intersection of Kethel road. I realised that I had missed my turn and I decided to make a ‘U’ turn at the intersection of Sutherland road and Kethel road. I stopped in the middle of the intersection but still within my lane. I was about to make a ‘U’ turn when I heard a motorbike approaching the rear of my car. I had only turned the steering wheel to the right and indicated. When I heard the motor cycle I stopped completely, looked over my shoulder and heard the collision and looked forward to see the motor cyclist flying through the air, about 20 metres. I got out of my car to check on the motorcyclist. I then rang 000.” 
        
       
       
      The entry in the police notebook was signed by the defendant. 
       
      
    20 The defendant, in his evidence-in-chief, confirmed that he was unfamiliar with the area, had taken a wrong turn and had decided to make a U turn at the intersection to go back the way he had come. He then gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Did you identify a place to do that?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. Where was that place?  
           
          A. That was at the corner of what I know now as Kethel and Sutherland Road.  
           
           
          Q. What was it about that position that led you to attempt to turn there? 
           
          A. There were double lines that had broken. It stopped and it started again and there were two lanes on either side of the road.  
           
           
          Q. What did you do when you got to that intersection?  
           
          A. I stopped.  
           
           
          Q. When you stopped where was your vehicle?  
           
          A. There's two lanes there. It was in the centre of the road, near the centre line at a slight angle.  
           
           
          Q. Which way to the right or left? 
           
          A. To the right.  
           
           
          Q. When you said you stopped, did you in fact come to a full stop?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. What did you do then? 
           
          A. I saw the street sign and realised I'd travelled in the wrong direction, put my indicator on and that was the point at which I heard the noise.  
           
           
          Q. When you say you put your indicator on, which way did you indicate?  
           
          A. Right indicator, to say I was turning around to travel in the other direction.  
           
           
          Q. Do you say you then heard a sound?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. When you heard the sound were you still stationary?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. What was the sound you heard? 
           
          A. It was a high pitch, like a revving kind of noise of a car engine. 
           
           
          Q. Did you recognise that it was the sound of a motorcycle at that time? 
           
          A. No.  
           
           
          Q. Having heard a high pitch noise, what did you do? 
           
          A. I checked my mirrors, my right hand mirror, my rear vision mirror and blind spot.  
           
           
          Q. Did you see anything? 
           
          A. No.  
           
           
          Q. What did you do?  
           
          A. I heard the noise again. It appeared to be getting louder. That's when I checked my blind spots and mirrors again.  
           
           
          Q. Still saw nothing?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. What did you do then? 
           
          A. That's when I turned the steering wheel and pulled my foot off the brake and started to turn, which is when the collision happened.  
           
           
          Q. When were you first aware that there was a noise near your vehicle? 
           
          A. About a second. Not even that. Less than a second before it hit me.  
           
           
          Q. What did you see?  
           
          A. Just the motorbike hit above my driver side tyre.  
           
           
          Q. Did you see the motorcyclist? 
           
          A. No.  
           
           
          Q. In any event, did you get out of your car?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. Had your car moved from where you had stopped?  
           
          A. No. It wasn't capable of moving.  
           
           
          Q. I know. You came to a stop? 
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. Before the accident?  
           
          A. Yes.  
           
           
          Q. After the accident was your car in a slightly different position?  
           
          A. Maybe slightly. Not much.  
           
           
          Q. You didn't notice?  
           
          A. Yes - no…  
           
           
          Q. Did you at any time turn into Kethel Street?  
           
          A. No.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    21 In cross examination the defendant gave evidence inter alia that: 
     
      
       
      (a) prior to the accident he had practised doing U turns in the Mazda many times in the course of his driving tuition, was well practised in knowing what width of roadway was necessary to get the Mazda around in a U turn, he knew he should not attempt a U turn in areas where the visibility of his vehicle was restricted to other motorists, he knew he should look to make sure the roadway was clear both ahead and behind him and to make the turn reasonably quickly; 
       
       
      (b) he accepted there were better places to make a U turn than that chosen by him on this occasion but he thought that as there were two lanes on the southern side of the road he could complete the U turn and if he did not make it he would be able to do a three point turn. He did not think he would cause an obstruction as there was not much traffic around; 
       
       
      (c) he agreed he had the opportunity to move into the turning lane on the northern side of Sutherland Road and to make his U turn from there through the break in the double white lines or to pull into the mouth of Kethel Road and make his U turn from there, thus eliminating the possibility of being forced to make a three point turn; 
       
       
      (d) that the angle between the car and the centre of the road where he stopped was a slight angle, approximately ten degrees;  
       
       
      (e) he stopped before continuing to move into the U turn to check the name of the intersecting street to confirm he had gone the wrong way. He said he looked at the street sign on approach, he did not know the street, which confirmed he had gone the wrong way. He agreed he believed the road was clear in both directions but stopped rather than continue straight into the U turn because “that’s when I heard - when I checked. When I saw the street sign I figured I had gone the wrong way. That’s when I heard the noise of the motorbike”; 
       
       
      (f) when he first heard the noise of the motorcycle he checked his blind spots, the rear vision mirror, and the external mirrors of the vehicle and saw nothing. He then went to go. He turned the steering wheel a bit but he did not move the vehicle as the noise was getting louder and closer to him. He checked in the mirrors for a second time but saw nothing approaching him. He started to turn the wheel and was in the process of taking his foot off the brake and engaging the clutch when the accident occurred. The vehicle was moving just slightly at the time of the impact, less than 1 km/h. The noise never stopped after he first heard it and it only got louder. He could not explain how in checking his mirrors he did not see the motorcycle; 
       
       
      (g) he agreed he did not say anything to Constable Lang about checking the Kethel Road sign or tell him he had checked the mirrors at all, much less twice, nor did he tell him he had moved off just before the impact. He said he had seen the impact even though Constable Lang had merely recorded that he had heard it. He gave the following evidence: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. You didn’t tell the constable you checked your mirrors at all, much less twice? 
           
          A. Well, like, that was pretty much taken maybe half an hour, an hour afterwards, so I was still in a bit of shock. I thought it was just - I didn’t know it would go this far. I thought it was just like a statement about the accident. I didn’t know that they had to have details and stuff like that, because I was only 17 at the time. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. You said to the constable you looked over your shoulder and heard the collision? 
           
          A. Yes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. You didn’t say you saw the collision, did you? 
           
          A. Well, I did, yes. Like I said, when I was filling that out, when we were writing that statement, I didn’t think it was important to add any detail.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (h) he denied he had given a falsely exculpatory version of events to the police to avoid the loss of his provisional licence; 
       
       
      (i) he agreed that with the benefit of hindsight, the logical way to attempt a U turn at this location was to turn into the mouth of Kethel Road to widen the turn and that by so doing the street sign would be right in front of his eyes. He denied that that was what he had in fact attempted to do; 
       
       
      (j) it was obvious to him that he was going the wrong way before he reached the intersection and gave the following evidence: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Therefore there was no need to stop and look at the Kethel Road sign or any other street sign? 
           
          A. You could say that, but to me it helped me to confirm it was the wrong way.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (k) he was asked why he began to move when the sound was loudest and closest and replied: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Like I said before, I wasn't sure that that noise was from the road. There were a number of houses on the side of the road. It might have been somewhere in their garage or somewhere in the front yard. I wasn't sure where it was coming from and since I couldn't see anything I guess I didn't think it was on the road.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       He agreed with the proposition that “by the time [he] moved a split second before the impact it must have been obvious that whatever was making that sound was right on top of [him]”. He gave the following evidence: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “Q. Can you explain why, on your version of events, you chose to move when the sound was right on top of you at its loudest and you didn't know where it was coming from? Why?  
           
          A. I thought I was an inexperienced driver, I couldn't tell it was on the road, didn't know what direction it was coming from, probably the best thing to do was continue what I was doing instead of stopping in the middle of the road.” 
          
         
        
       
       
       He said that by the time he moved the sound must have been coming from within a few metres from him. 
       
       
      Constable Lang 
       
      
    22 Constable Lang gave evidence. He had commenced as a probationary constable in December 2000 and completed the probationary period in December 2001. He had not done a crash investigation course and had no formal training in analysis of motor vehicle accidents and was reliant upon his experience in attending motor accident scenes as part of his general duties. The Crash Investigation Unit did not attend the accident.  
     
      
    23 Constable Lang gave evidence as to his observations at the scene and the taking of various photographs which were tendered in evidence. Constable Lang said that he wrote down in his notebook exactly what the plaintiff told him at the hospital. He regarded the version recorded as “not possible”. He said that any matter of relevance would have been included in the notebook, that if he had been told of the car poking its nose into Kethel Road he would have recorded it. The first time he ever heard that mentioned was when cross examined at this hearing. It was apparent that he put in his notebook in quotation marks, seemingly in answer to a single question, material which he had earlier confirmed with the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
      The objective evidence 
       
      
    24 The following facts, based upon the police photographs, police evidence and medical reports were either common ground or not the subject of serious dispute: 
     
      
       
      (a) The initial impact was between the front tyre of the motorcycle and the offside front wheel of the car. The initial impact occurred in the eastbound traffic lane opposite the mouth of Kethel Road and adjacent to the gap in the unbroken centre lines. 
       
       
      (b) Following the impact, the car came to rest wholly within the eastbound lane of Sutherland Road at an angle of 11 to the centreline. The offside front tyre was at the gap in the centreline in line with the unbroken barrier lines. 
       
       
      (c) There was a black skid mark on the road. It commenced with a short mark, which acutely changed direction and continued in a straight line for about three metres, finishing under the offside front tyre of the car. 
       
       
      (d) There was extensive damage to the right mudguard of the car and some damage to its bonnet area. The offside front wheel was damaged and out of alignment. There was a large amount of oil in this area. The driver’s side mirror was pushed backward. Apart from the mirror, there was no damage to the driver’s door or the remainder of the offside of the car. 
       
       
      (e) The motorcycle came to rest in bushes on the southern side of the road with its nearside against an embankment. It was approximately six metres in front of the offside front wheel of the car. It was facing west. It was badly damaged, with damage to the front faring, handlebars, front forks and gearbox. 
       
       
      (f) The plaintiff was thrown into the air on impact and landed on the roadway approximately 13 metres from the front of the car in its rest position. He then slid, approximately, a further 12 metres along the roadway. He sustained, relevantly to the question of liability, a fractured pelvis, fractured left shaft of the femur and neck of the femur, lacerations and cruciate damage to the knees and a fracture of left scaphoid and ulna styloid process. 
       
       
      Expert witnesses 
       
      
    25 The primary issue was whether the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s version of events was to be accepted. If the plaintiff’s version was accepted the accident occurred because the defendant was making a U turn and failed to observe and give way to the plaintiff’s motorcycle. Senior counsel for the defendant conceded that version of events, if accepted, would result in a finding of negligence against the defendant. If the defendant’s version was accepted, the accident occurred when the car was stationary (or barely moving) in the eastbound marked traffic lane with the right hand indicator activated when the plaintiff collided with it in circumstances where there was available a clear view of the car from the top of the western crest and no other traffic on that section of the road. If that version of events was accepted, the plaintiff, who had the onus of proof, must fail in his claim.  
     
      
    26 Considerable expert evidence was called by the parties in an endeavour to provide scientific support for the version of one or other of the parties. The plaintiff qualified Dr Griffiths, who holds the degrees of Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering and Master of Biomechanical Engineering and has practised in both fields for 30 years, Dr Gibson, a biomedical engineer with expertise in biochemical engineering and accident reconstruction, and Mr Johnston, a consulting engineer. The defendant qualified Mr Keramidas, whose area of expertise was forensic engineering and collision reconstruction, and Dr McIntosh, whose area of expertise is biomechanics. Each of these witnesses gave evidence. 
     
      
    27 The evidence available to the experts upon which to reach their conclusions was somewhat limited. The car and motorcycle were not available for inspection, photographs of them following the accident were taken at night, there was only one photograph of the motorcycle, the skid marks were marked using white paint applied, somewhat inaccurately, by torchlight at night. There were no daylight photographs of the skid marks and no record of the position of any debris occasioned by the collision. 
     
      
    28 The experts qualified by the plaintiff deduced from the skid marks that the car was moving at the time of impact. They were of the opinion that the nature of the damage to the car and other indicia were indicative of an impact by the motorcycle with the offside front wheel and mudguard of the car and a secondary impact by the plaintiff himself, the latter causing damage to the mudguard nearer to the front offside door and a fracture of the plaintiff’s femur. The pushing backward of the driver’s side mirror was also the result of contact with the plaintiff’s person. In the opinion of Mr Griffiths, the likely impact angle of the vehicles was 70º, Dr Gibson considered it was 60-80º and Mr Johnston opined it was in excess of 45º. 
     
      
    29 This evidence was consistent with the plaintiff’s version of events. It was not consistent with the defendant’s version of events nor an impact angle of 30º. 
     
      
    30 Mr Keramidas deduced from the available evidence that the impact angle was 30º. He acknowledged that an impact angle of 25º or less would have resulted in damage to the front offside door of the car and rearwards. 
     
      
    31 The evidence of Dr McIntosh was not of any particular assistance on the issue of the impact angle. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    32 Senior counsel for the defendant submitted the plaintiff’s evidence should be rejected particularly as: 
     
      
       
      (a) The accident occurred because the plaintiff was not keeping a proper look out and did not see the defendant’s stationary vehicle prior to the collision. 
       
       
      (b) The plaintiff had fabricated the version of events which he relied upon and in particular had never mentioned to the police officer that he had seen the car nosing into Kethel Road. 
       
       
      (c) The plaintiff gave evidence he was 150 metres from the car when he first saw it. If this was correct, then, even on his version of events, the car would have been out of his path long before he reached it.  
       
       
      (d) If the car was two-thirds through the U turn when the plaintiff saw it, it would have been more than 90 
      º 
       across the roadway. 
       
       
      (e) There was evidence from Mr Keramidas that an impact at an angle anywhere approaching 60 
      º 
       was inconsistent with the final position of the motorcycle. 
       
       
      (f) There was evidence from Mr Keramidas that the damage to the gearbox of the motorcycle described by the police supported a shallow impact angle. 
       
      
    33 Senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted the plaintiff’s evidence should be accepted as it was internally consistent and also more consistent with the likely behaviour of a driver placed in the defendant’s position than that asserted by the defendant. He responded to the defendant’s submissions as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) The first recorded version of events by the plaintiff was that contained in Constable Lang’s notebook made about three weeks after the accident. It was submitted for the defendant that the three weeks delay provided ample time for the plaintiff to fabricate a version of events consistent with negligence on the part of the defendant. The plaintiff however gave evidence he had not discussed the circumstances of the accident with anyone prior to being interviewed by Constable Lang. The plaintiff was not cross examined on this issue. The plaintiff informed Constable Lang that the defendant was making a U turn at the time. Unless the plaintiff had observed the defendant, he would not have been aware of this information which accorded with the defendant’s assertion that he was making a U turn.  
       
       
      (b) It was improbable that the plaintiff, with an uninterrupted view of the road ahead for, relevantly, 180 metres, would have failed to observe the defendant’s vehicle stationary with its indicator on in the eastbound lane and not taken appropriate avoiding action particularly as there were no streets intersecting Sutherland Road other than Kethel Road and no evidence of any activity to divert his attention elsewhere.  
       
       
      (c) The plaintiff said he told the police officer he saw the car poking its nose into Kethel Road. This was not noted in the statement signed by the plaintiff in the constable’s notebook. Constable Lang said he would have noted it if it had been mentioned. The Court should find that the plaintiff told Constable Lang that he saw the car poking its nose into Kethel Road. Constable Lang’s evidence that he was not told of it should be rejected. Constable Lang said he would have attempted to record all that he considered relevant. However, it is apparent Constable Lang did not record every question and answer verbatim in his notebook. The reason why the observation was omitted may have been because the constable considered it irrelevant as he had concluded the plaintiff’s version of the accident was not possible, he may have simply omitted it in the course of constructing the statement or the plaintiff may not have made it clear to him: see the evidence of the plaintiff reproduced at [15 Q 4-5] in this judgment. 
       
       
      (d) It may be accepted that if the distance between the plaintiff and the car was 150 metres when the plaintiff first saw it poking its nose into Kethel Road or emerging from it, it is likely the car would have cleared his path before he would have reached it. However, the plaintiff said in his evidence that he could not say what the distance was. He had not gone back to check it. It was more likely that when he saw the car poking its nose into Kethel Road it was about 100 metres from him, a distance consistent with the likely speed of the car and with it being in his path when he reached it. 
       
       
      (e) The path of the car described by the plaintiff in Exhibit 1 was consistent with his oral evidence and was the most probable path taken by the car. The contemplated U turn could be completed from that position and it was consistent with the diagrammatic analysis by Mr Griffith. 
       
       
      (f) It was not possible to determine where the motorcycle should have ended up after the collision. There were too many factors, assumptions and variables to enable any firm conclusion to be reached. The plaintiff’s experts did not accept the final resting place of the motorcycle excluded an angle of impact of more than 30 
      º 
      . In their opinion, the final resting point was more consistent with an impact angle of 70 
      º 
       than 30 
      º 
      . The evidence of Mr Keramidas was speculative and should not be accepted. In any event, it did not constitute incontrovertible evidence such as to preclude the acceptance of the plaintiff’s version of events. 
       
       
      (g) The experts had no opportunity to examine the gearbox. There was no photograph of it. In the absence of an opportunity to examine the damaged gearbox or a photograph of it, it was not possible to deduce an angle of impact from the rupture of the gearbox. On the available evidence, the damage to the gearbox could be consistent with an impact angle ranging from 30 
      º 
      -80 
      º 
      . Mr Keramidas accepted it could be explained otherwise than by an angle of 30 
      º 
      . 
       
      
    34 Senior counsel for the defendant submitted, in essence, that the defendant’s evidence should be accepted as his evidence had been consistent, he was unmoved by cross examination on critical matters and, as a 17 year old schoolboy, it was unlikely that within half an hour of the accident he would have made up a story that satisfied the police that he was not at fault. 
     
      
    35 Senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted the defendant’s evidence should be rejected as inherently improbable essentially because: 
     
      
       
      (a) It was improbable the defendant would attempt a U turn from the point where he said he stopped the car as there was insufficient space to perform the manoeuvre (the width of the northern side of the road was 6.9 metres, the turning circle of the car at least 9.5 metres) and a three point turn would involve the risk of collision with vehicles coming down the incline from the eastern crest. The defendant was aware of the turning circle of his car. There was no reason to attempt to make the U turn at that point as the available area for turning could have been widened by simply moving into the left-hand turn lane or into the mouth of Kethel Road. 
       
       
      (b) There were no vehicles on that section of the road so far as the defendant was aware and no reason why he could not have performed the U turn without stopping. The explanation that he wished to check the street name was unconvincing as he was already aware he was travelling in the wrong direction and, as he was unfamiliar with the area, there was no prospect a street name would have been meaningful to him. It was not necessary for him to stop to read the sign as he could see it on his approach. If there was a difficulty in reading it, the easiest way to read it was to turn the vehicle into the mouth of Kethel Road, not to stop almost perpendicular to the sign. 
       
       
      (c) The defendant gave evidence that he had checked his mirrors on two occasions but did not see the motorcycle and that he allowed his vehicle to move a split second before impact. The checking of the mirrors, if it occurred, occurred a second or two before the impact. The motorcycle was there to be seen. It would be impossible not to see it, particularly as its headlight was illuminated.  
       
       
      (d) It was totally illogical to put the car into motion at a time when the noise (of the motorcycle) was “right on top of” the defendant and he was not aware of its cause. Common sense indicated that the appropriate course was to hold one’s position.  
       
       
      (e) The defendant accepted he had mentioned none of the matters in (b), (c) or (d) to the police. His explanation for this failure was not acceptable. This evidence was demonstrably false. 
       
       
      (f) (i) The defendant’s evidence was that he stopped in the  
       
      eastbound lane near the centreline and at a slight angle to it. He estimated the angle between the car and the centreline at 10 
      º 
      . The car remained stationary in that position until impact or it may have just started to move a split second before. 
       
       
       (ii) An angle of 10 
      º 
       to the centreline was consistent with a vehicle travelling normally, coming to a halt in its lane preparatory to making a turn to its right. An angle of 30 
      º 
       was not consistent. 
       
       
       (iii) The evidence was that the motorcycle was travelling parallel to the centreline prior to the collision. It was not put to the plaintiff in cross examination or asserted in submissions that the plaintiff had been riding on the incorrect side of the road. If the impact angle was 10 
      º 
      , the damage to the car would have extended to the front door of the car and rearward. All experts agreed the damage sustained by the car was inconsistent with an impact angle of 10 
      º 
      . The defendant’s expert accepted that there would have been further damage to the offside of the car rearward from the front mudguard had the impact angle been less than 25 
      º 
      . 
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    36 The principal submission for the defendant was that the Court should accept his evidence as to what happened. I am unable to do so. The fact that the defendant was prepared to make a U turn at an inappropriate place may be capable of explanation on the basis of his inexperience and that he did not weigh up the situation objectively as his mind was focussing upon the fact that he had missed the turn and had to find his way back. It may be that he needed to stop and get his bearings and that confirmation that he did not recognise the name of the intersecting street was part of that process. It may be that, being inexperienced, he thought he should move away from whatever was causing the noise, which by then was very close. Thus each of those explanations may be plausible.  
     
      
    37 It may be that he did look in the rear vision and side mirrors, but if he did it is difficult to comprehend how he could have failed to see the motorcycle. More importantly, I am unable to reconcile the damage to the car with the defendant’s evidence as to the angle at which he had stopped the car prior to impact. It does not seem to me that one can legitimately infer that the defendant stopped the car at an angle in the order of 30 or, on his evidence, that he moved it into such a position prior to impact. His evidence does not justify such a conclusion nor do I regard the evidence of Mr Keramidas as compelling such a conclusion. Accordingly, I do not accept the defendant’s evidence as to the manner in which the accident occurred. 
     
      
    38 Of course, it does not follow from the non acceptance of the defendant’s version of events that the plaintiff’s version must be accepted. However, on balance, it seems to me the plaintiff’s version should be accepted essentially for the reasons advanced by his senior counsel (see [33]). This conclusion is strengthened by the evidence of the plaintiff’s experts which is consistent with the evidence of the plaintiff. There is no incontrovertible expert or other evidence which would militate against the acceptance of the plaintiff’s version. Accordingly, I accept that version as to how the accident happened. 
     
      
    39 It follows that the question of liability must be determined upon the basis that the plaintiff’s version of events is correct. The defendant owed a duty of care to check for traffic approaching in either direction before re-entering Sutherland Road and to give way to such traffic if there was a risk of collision if he proceeded. If the defendant had exercised reasonable care he could not have failed to see the plaintiff’s motorcycle approaching. In my opinion, there was negligence by the defendant in failing to observe the plaintiff’s approaching motorcycle and failing to give way to it. There will be a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum agreed by the parties. 
     
      
       
      Contributory negligence 
       
      
    40 In Podrebeserk v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Ltd (1985) 59 ALJR 492 at 494 the High Court held: 
     
      
       
        
        “The making of an apportionment as between a plaintiff and a defendant of their respective shares in the responsibility for the damages involves a comparison both of culpability, ie of the degree of departure from the standard of care of the reasonable man, and of the relative importance of the acts of the parties in causing the damage.” 
        
       
      
    41 The defendant submitted the plaintiff was guilty of a substantial degree of contributory negligence, which could not be less than 40 percent because: 
     
      
       
      (a) he was riding at a speed in excess of the 50 km/h speed limit, which speed his expert, Mr Gibson, estimated at between 56 and 67 km/h (to which was to be added something for the wiped-off speed during the impact) and which Mr Keramidas estimated at 75-80 km/h; and 
       
       
      (b) “[the plaintiff] sees this vehicle doing a U turn. It has its indicator on. Its coming and it keeps coming, and he does nothing, except perhaps trying to get around the front of it, when slowing down, moving to the left, or even just moving to the left, would have prevented injury.” He also failed to keep a proper look out after he moved to the right. 
       
      
    42 The plaintiff accepted that the failure to adjust his speed and to take into account the potential that the defendant would not look was an act of contributory negligence. It was submitted the Court should find the plaintiff’s speed was 60 km/h, particularly as the plaintiff’s expert, Mr Johnston, had estimated the plaintiff’s speed as not being inconsistent with 60 km/h and the assessment by Mr Keramidas contained an error and should be reduced by 10 km/h. 
     
      
    43 The plaintiff submitted the defendant was grossly negligent in that he failed to look in the direction of eastbound traffic and turned straight into the path of the plaintiff. The negligence of the plaintiff was relatively slight. The appropriate apportionment for contributory negligence was 15 percent. 
     
      
    44 The expert evidence as to the estimates of the plaintiff’s speed were conflicting and speculative. In my opinion, the defendant, upon whom the onus rests, has not established the plaintiff’s speed was in excess of the 60 km/h which the plaintiff conceded. However, in my opinion that speed was excessive in the circumstances. 
     
      
    45 The primary responsibility was upon the defendant. It was he who, I have found, in breach of the road rules, created a situation of danger and he who must, in my opinion, bear the larger proportion of responsibility. However, the plaintiff’s evidence was that at all times that he observed the car it was moving. The risk that the car might not stop and that a collision could occur should have been apparent to the plaintiff. In my opinion, the plaintiff should have slowed his motorcycle to a speed which, in the event the car continued, would have enabled the car to pass safely in front of him or for him to move to the left or, if necessary, into Kethel Road. There was no physical evidence the plaintiff took any avoiding action. 
     
      
    46 In my opinion, the appropriate apportionment for contributory negligence is 25 percent. 
     
      
    47 The agreed damages are $2.45 million. There will be a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $2.45 million. That sum will be reduced by 25 percent for contributory negligence. Accordingly, there will be judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $1,837,500 plus costs.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: On 27 July 2006 Patrick John Page, the applicant, pleaded guilty in the District Court at Parramatta to a charge that on 3 June 2005 at Bankstown in the State of New South Wales he drove a motor vehicle in a manner dangerous to other persons whereby the vehicle was involved in an impact as a result of which the death of Trong Tai Pham was occasioned and when he was driving the vehicle in an attempt to escape pursuit by a police officer. The offence being one of aggravated dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 At the time the plea was entered, it was indicated that certain facts were in dispute and the proceedings were set down for hearing. When the applicant came before the Judge on 31 July 2006 three areas of dispute were identified being the speed the applicant’s vehicle was travelling shortly before and at the time of impact; the contribution (if any) to the accident of the levels of morphine and codeine in the applicant’s blood and whether there had been significant contributory negligence by the driver of the vehicle in which the deceased had been a passenger.  
     
      
    5 After hearing evidence over three days, the Judge on 3 August 2006 was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant’s vehicle was travelling at 65 kilometres per hour just before impact. Her Honour found that he was significantly impaired by the consumption of heroin. Her Honour was further satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no contributory negligence by Mr Nguyen, the other driver. 
     
      
    6 Following submissions on sentence, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years to date from 3 August 2006 with a balance of term of one year and four months. An offence of driving a conveyance knowing that it was taken without the consent of the owner contrary to s 154A(1)(b) of the Crimes Act on a Form 1 was taken into account. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 2 August 2010.  
     
      
    7 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    8 Related charges were dealt with pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and are not the subject of this appeal.  
     
      
    9 The notice of appeal identifies eight grounds some of which may be conveniently dealt with together. The applicant who is self-represented did not appear before this court and is content to have the appeal determined on the written submissions which have been filed. He was legally represented during the proceedings before the Judge.  
     
      
    10 The facts which were found by the Judge were relevantly as follows (ROS at p3-4): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        At 6pm on Friday 3 June 2005, Mr Page was driving a vehicle which had been stolen from Mr Aloisi in March 2005. He was observed by Senior Constable Curtin, a police motorcyclist, to be travelling at excessive speed in Northam Avenue, Bankstown. Senior Constable Curtin followed the vehicle, the Ford XR8 utility. He made some inquiries over the police radio about the registration plate displayed on the rear of the vehicle and found that it belonged to another car, a red Mitsubishi with expired registration. He then continued to follow the vehicle and at a set of traffic lights, he pulled up next to the driver’s side window of the vehicle and asked Mr Page to pull over at Stanley Street so that he could talk to him about the car and Mr Page agreed. 
        
       
       
        
        When Mr Page turned from Stacey Street to Stanley Street he accelerated such that the constable formed the view that Mr Page was not going to pull over as he had agreed to. Senior Constable Curtain pursued Mr Page and at some point along that street, probably a bit later than he initially gave in evidence in these proceedings he called a pursuit. Mr Page continued to accelerate along the road, overtaking a vehicle on the left hand side near the first cross street of Cross Street and accelerated to a speed which I found, after the disputed facts hearing to be 65 kilometres per hour in a 50 kilometre per hour speed limit zone and his vehicle collided with a vehicle which the driver, Mr Nguyen, had reversed out of the driveway at 20 Stanley Street, Bankstown. Mr Nguyen had a passenger in his car. The car was on the roadway at the point where Mr Nguyen was intending to being to drive the vehicle forward, having completed the reversing motion, when the collision occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Pham, the passenger, suffered fatal internal injuries and died at the scene. Mr Page ran from the utility and ran through nearby residential properties followed by Senior Constable Curtin on the motorcycle and by members of the public who eventually assisted 
          
        in apprehending Mr Page. 
        
       
       
        
        He was taken to Liverpool hospital, a blood sample was obtained and showed that Mr Page had a morphine level of .87 milligrams per litre of morphine [sic] in his blood. There was also a small concentration of codeine.  
        
       
       
        
        A mechanical examination revealed no mechanical fault or defect in the vehicle which contributed to the collision. It was found that Mr Page was a disqualified driver from the period of 8 April 2004 to 8 April 2006. That gives rise to the related offence of driving whilst disqualified.” 
        
       
      
    11 The applicant was born on 24 September 1968 and was 37 years old at the time of sentence. He has an unattractive prior criminal history. Her Honour counted 17 entries for driving whilst disqualified or driving whilst cancelled; two offences of driving under the influence or driving in a manner dangerous; 18 offences of break, enter and steal; 49 entries for stealing or receiving stolen goods or being in custody of goods suspected of being stolen and 44 entries in terms of offences of illegal use of motor vehicles, stealing motor vehicles or possessing implements capable of being used to enter motor vehicles. The Judge found that the applicant’s criminal history “indicates a continuing disregard for the law by Mr Page and a need for personal deterrence” (ROS at 6). 
     
      
    12 The applicant gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence. Her Honour expressly noted that since he had been in prison he had undertaken a methadone program and was on a reduced dosage. The applicant said that he had been a heroin user for 10 to 12 years.  
     
      
    13 At the time of the commission of the offence the applicant was on parole for an offence of break, enter and steal. Her Honour noted his evidence that he had stopped reporting to his parole officer and had left the Charles O’Neill Life Skills Program which he was required to enter as a condition of his parole. His parole had been revoked and at the time of sentence he was serving the balance of parole. Her Honour remarked upon the applicant’s ambitions when released from custody to settle down with his partner and hopefully have children with her. 
     
      
    14 I now propose to deal with the grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    15 Ground 2: Given the circumstances and advice I received from my legal team that the discount for the plea of guilty of only 10 per cent fell short.  
     
      
    16 The “final paperwork”, was not put forward, the applicant submits, by the Crown until very late and his plea of guilty was entered shortly after the paperwork was submitted. He further mentions that one of the trial dates was adjourned due to the state of the cells in the Parramatta Court complex. He submits that a discount for the plea of 15 to 20 per cent should have been allowed by the Judge.  
     
      
    17 The Crown submits that the trial was listed on two occasions but the trial dates were vacated on applications by the defence.  
     
      
    18 As her Honour observed, the plea of guilty was entered two [working] days before his trial was to commence. He was charged with the offence contrary to s 52A(2) of the Crimes Act on 30 June 2005. A plea of not guilty was entered in the Local Court and he was committed for trial. Counsel for the applicant submitted to the Judge that the applicant had always been willing to plead guilty to the simple offence of dangerous driving occasioning death which her Honour rejected as operating in anyway to increase the utilitarian discount for the plea as the Crown had never been willing to accept a plea to the lesser offence. The Judge considered that neither late funding obtained from Legal Aid nor the late retainer of Professor Starmer should impact upon the assessment of the discount. Having regard to the lateness of the plea and the disputed facts, her Honour assessed the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea to be 10 per cent.  
     
      
    19 This was a late plea of guilty the utilitarian value of which was diminished by the disputed facts hearing which occupied some four days. It is unclear what the “paperwork” is the applicant refers to but it seems from the submissions made by his counsel to the Judge that the late service of Crown documents was the reason advanced for the first trial to be vacated. In any event, it was always open to the applicant to plead guilty in the Local Court or to advise his legal representatives that he wished to do so after he had been committed for trial. The adjournments which delayed the commencement of the trial could have been avoided by the entry of a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    20 It is well established that the discount for the utilitarian value of a plea should generally be assessed in the range of 10 to 25 per cent: R v Thomson & Houlton (1999-2000) 49 NSWLR 383. It was open to her Honour to assess the utilitarian value of the plea at the low end of the range and no error has been demonstrated. Ground 2 of the appeal is rejected.  
     
      
    21 Ground 4: I believe her Honour erred in not finding any contributory negligence on behalf of [the] other driver Mr Nguyen.  
     
      
       
      Ground 5 
      :  
      I believe more weight should [have] been given to the fact the photos tendered as evidence did not reflect the true setting on the night.  
       
      
    22 The applicant raises a number of aspects of Mr Nguyen’s evidence during the disputed facts hearing which, he submits, shows that Mr Nguyen did not look before he (Mr Nguyen) reversed onto the roadway. He contends that the photographs from the night of the accident support [a finding] that there is no way Mr Nguyen could have seen his vehicle when he said he did. The photographs, he submits, taken at a later date which were tendered in evidence mislead the court as to the “real view” on the night. Mr Nguyen, he argues, was either mistaken or incorrect in his evidence that he saw the applicant’s vehicle and no other. He makes further reference to differences in Mr Nguyen’s estimates of the time from when he looked until he reversed his car onto the roadway. The applicant contends that when Mr Nguyen reversed onto the roadway it was difficult to see [his vehicle] as it did not have its headlights on. He points out that the Crown’s submission that Constable McIntyre inspected Mr Nguyen’s car at the scene and observed that the light switch was in the “on” position was incorrect which is conceded by the Crown. He provides a hand drawn sketch showing trees, parked cars and lamp posts in support of his submissions.  
     
      
    23 The hand drawn sketch was not in evidence before the Judge and the Crown objects to its tender. As the Crown points out there is no evidence that it is an accurate depiction of the street on the night of the collision and the sketch is of no assistance.  
     
      
    24 All of the matters of which the applicant complains were sedulously considered by the Judge. Her Honour found that Mr Nguyen’s estimate of the time it took him to reverse down the driveway was not reliable. She accepted as being correct the criticism that the photographs taken not on the night by police did not accurately represent the scene on the night so far as there was an absence of parked cars. Her Honour, however, found that these photographs supported Mr Nguyen’s evidence and showed that a person could see the headlights of a car coming into Stanley Street at that point on the driveway where Mr Nguyen said he was. Having regard to the quality of Mr Nguyen’s evidence and to the photographs, her Honour accepted Mr Nguyen’s evidence. Her Honour found that Mr Nguyen, was “a patently honest witness”.  
     
      
    25 As to the applicant’s contention that Mr Nguyen’s vehicle did not have its headlights on, Mr Nguyen gave evidence that the headlights were on when he reversed out. It was the applicant’s evidence before the Judge that he did not see Mr Nguyen’s car before impact. 
     
      
    26 Where the evidence of witnesses conflict it is a matter for the Judge at first instance to determine which evidence is to be preferred. The Judge had seen and heard the witnesses. The weight to be given to evidence was also a matter for her Honour. Having accepted Mr Nguyen’s evidence, her Honour found there was no evidence of contributory negligence and was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was no contributory negligence by Mr Nguyen. Her Honour carefully assessed the evidence and the conclusions of fact the Judge reached were open to her. 
     
      
    27 The next point raised by the applicant is that in applying a standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt her Honour erred as the contributory negligence of Mr Nguyen had been advanced by him as a mitigating factor. The standard of proof was, he submits, on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
    28 In the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ in R v Olbrich [1999] 199 CLR 270 at [27] what was said by the majority in R v Storey [1998] VR 359 at 369 was adopted that a sentencing Judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “…may not take facts into account in a way that is adverse to the interests of the accused unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are circumstances which the judge proposes to take into account in favour of the accused, it is enough if those circumstances are proved on the balance of probabilities.”  
        
       
      
    29 The presence of contributory negligence on the part of the other driver, in my opinion, was a factor which may have been taken into account in favour of the applicant as reducing the objective seriousness of the offence. The applicant bore the onus of proving contributory negligence on the balance of probabilities.  
     
      
    30 In the proceedings before the Judge the Crown submitted that it was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was no contributory negligence on the part of Mr Nguyen. The Crown did not submit nor did her Honour adopt as the standard of proof that the applicant was required to prove contributory negligence beyond reasonable doubt. The standard of proof that the Judge applied was that the Crown was required to negative the existence of contributory negligence beyond reasonable doubt. This was a heavier burden than that of the onus being on the applicant on the balance of probabilities. Although the incorrect standard of proof was applied it did not impact adversely to the applicant on the finding that was ultimately made by her Honour. Moreover, the Judge accepted Mr Nguyen’s evidence. This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    31 Ground 6: I feel given the evidence of Senior Constable McIntyre of the Metro Crash Invest Unit show (sic) that I acted to the best of my ability to avoid the accident. 
     
      
    32 There is no merit in this ground of appeal. The Judge reviewed in her judgment Senior Constable McIntyre’s evidence. One of her factual findings was a rejection of the applicant’s assertion that Mr Nguyen must have reversed out of the driveway very quickly and without checking. The factual findings which were made were open to the Judge on the evidence.  
     
      
    33 Ground 1: I believe that the sentence imposed taking into account all facts was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 
      :  
      Given the guideline judgments in the two cases R v Jurisic and R v Whyte that the sentence imposed is on the high side.  
       
      
    34 Although two separate grounds are identified, there is in reality one complaint which is that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    35 The applicant submits that on all [of] the facts that the sentence [should not have] fallen at the top end of the scale. On the information he had received from the Judicial Commission of NSW for sentences for similar offences he contends that his sentence was at the top end of the scale. He submits given the guideline judgments in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, that his sentence was at the very top end of sentences that have been imposed. More weight, he argues, was given to the factors of aggravation than there should have been. 
     
      
    36 The information which the applicant says that he received from the Judicial Commission was not detailed in his submissions nor was it forwarded to this Court. The Judge was, however, referred to statistics from the Judicial Commission’s database by the Crown to which her Honour in her sentencing remarks said “showed sentences ranging from twelve months to eight years head sentence with non-parole periods or fixed terms ranging from twelve months to six years.” ROS at 10. 
     
      
    37 As was said by Hislop J in Thompson v R [2007] NSWCCA 299 at [24] the upper limit of the range of sentence is not provided by the statistical information provided by the Judicial Commission but by the maximum penalty which in this case is 14 years.  
     
      
    38 Her Honour was further referred to a number of relevant decisions of this Court by the applicant’s counsel which included R v Ryan (2003) 141 A Crim R 403 which she said provided some guidance. 
     
      
    39 In Jurisic this Court gave a guideline judgment in respect of offences under s 52A of the Crimes Act. The Court held at 231 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “With a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence (minimum plus additional or fixed term) of less than three years (in the case of dangerous driving causing death) and less than two years (in the case of dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm) should be exceptional.”  
        
       
      
    40 In Whyte the guidelines in Jurisic were confirmed subject to some relatively minor changes and clarifications. 
     
      
    41 In the present case, the applicant was charged with an aggravated offence of dangerous driving causing death. The element elevating it to an aggravated offence (increasing the available statutory maximum from 10 to 14 years imprisonment) was his driving to escape pursuit by police. Spigelman CJ said in Whyte at [231]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In the case of the aggravated version of each offence under s 52A of the Crimes Act 1900, an appropriate increment to reflect the higher maximum penalty, and what will generally be a higher level of moral culpability, is required.” 
        
       
      
    42 Careful regard was given by her Honour to what was said in Jurisic and Whyte. The Judge noted that escaping a police pursuit was the factor which gave rise to the aggravated offence and that other aggravating factors present included the applicant’s substance abuse which had significantly impaired his driving ability by recent consumption and the degree of speed at which he was driving above the speed limit. 
     
      
    43 Her Honour found that it was an aggravating factor that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on parole. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: see, for example, Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40-42].  
     
      
    44 As her Honour found in the passage I have quoted at [9] (supra), the applicant’s criminal history indicated a continuing disregard for the law. The Judge was entitled having regard to the criminal history to give more weight to considerations of retribution, personal deterrence and protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566.  
     
      
    45 Her Honour, in my opinion, gave appropriate weight to the factors of aggravation and to the defendant’s subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    46 The Crown cited the decisions of this Court in Ryan and R v Woodward [2001] NSWCCA 90, in which a number of decisions of this Court concerning sentences for offences under s 52A of the Crimes Act were reviewed. There is no need to detail what otherwise can be read in those judgments. It is sufficient to state that the broad sentencing pattern disclosed does not lead me to conclude that the applicant’s sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    47 This is a serious crime. A collision occurred as a result of which Mr Pham lost his life. At the time the applicant was being pursued by police. Although the speed of the applicant’s vehicle was not so high as is often featured in police pursuits, it was being driven well in excess of the speed limit. His ability to drive the motor vehicle was significantly impaired by the consumption of heroin. The applicant was subject to parole at the time and his criminal history was significant. In determining the appropriate sentence, her Honour took into account, as was required, the offence on the Form 1.  
     
      
    48 I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. The sentence was in my view within the discretionary range open to her Honour.  
     
      
    49 The applicant contends that the Judge should have considered backdating his sentence. He was at the time of sentence serving the balance of parole. It was open to her Honour to commence the sentence from the expiration of the balance of parole on 14 March 2007. Although the Judge thought it was unlikely that the applicant would be released prior to 14 March 2007, her Honour considered the possibility. In order to avoid any gap between the applicant’s possible release and the commencement of the sentence to be imposed, the Judge commenced the sentence on 3 August 2006 which benefited the applicant. The date of commencement of the sentence was a matter within the Judge’s discretion and no error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    50 Grounds 1 and 7 of the appeal have not been established.  
     
      
    51 Ground 3: I know her Honour erred in failing to find the defendant showed little contrition or remorse for the offences.  
     
      
       
      Ground 8 
      :  
      I also feel that my solicitor failed in presenting relevant [psychological] evidence that was available on the effects of the accident on me.  
       
      
    52 These grounds of appeal are considered together as in each ground the applicant complains about his legal representation. 
     
      
    53 The applicant states that the Judge said that “she felt I showed little or no remorse nor did I show any contrition”. He blames his legal representation for this as it was “their job” to ensure the right questions were asked to enable him to express his true feelings.  
     
      
    54 It seems that the applicant has misunderstood what was said by her Honour. The Judge said (ROS at 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “In terms of contrition or remorse, Mr Page did not expressly express contrition or remorse for the death of Mr Pham. He said words to the effect of, “there’s nothing I can do or say to change that,” referring to Mr Pham having died at the scene. He said, “I’m not going to say I understand how his son feels.” It seems perhaps that that form of expression of remorse, which is not the most full or frank expression of remorse that I have heard in a court, is perhaps a result of what I perceive to be Mr Page having been hardened by his life of offending and his life in prison.” 
        
       
      
    55 And further (ROS at 9):  
     
      
       
        
        “Genuine remorse which, as I have said, I think it is qualified in expression but I think I can find it there…” 
        
       
      
    56 The Judge did not find that the applicant showed little or no remorse or contrition. Her Honour found genuine remorse. The applicant had the opportunity to express his remorse for his offence which her Honour took into account. There is no substance in this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    57 As to Ground 8, the applicant complains that his legal representatives did not put the best case forward on his behalf, that there should have been more evidence of the psychological affect of the accident upon him and some sort of psychological report should have been tendered. He has forwarded to this Court a report dated 24 May 2007 of Tim Watson-Munro, a consultant forensic psychologist. The psychologist opines, inter alia, in the report that the applicant has developed symptoms of a post traumatic stress disorder subsequent to being involved in the accident.  
     
      
    58 The applicant bears the burden of establishing that his legal representation has given rise to a miscarriage of justice. I am mindful that he is self-represented. The relevant principles were reviewed in the judgment of Gleeson CJ in Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at [9]. Normally such a ground of appeal cannot be pursued in the absence of evidence. There is no evidence from the applicant or his former legal representatives why a psychological report was not obtained. The transcript of the proceedings before the Judge demonstrates that the applicant was competently represented.  
     
      
    59 The real issue to my mind is whether a lesser sentence would have been imposed if the report of Mr Watson-Munro had been before the Judge.  
     
      
    60 In my view, the material disclosed in the report would not have a warranted a lesser sentence. There has been no miscarriage of justice. Ground 8 of the appeal is not established. 
     
      
    61 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    3 PRICE J: James Percy Ivimy seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Parramatta on 25 October 2006. The applicant had pleaded guilty in the District Court on 15 May 2006 to an indictment which contained 13 counts namely eight counts contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900, four counts contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act and one count contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act. The Judge imposed a total aggregate sentence of 11 years commencing on 28 July 2006 and expiring on 27 July 2017 with an effective aggregate non-parole period of eight years and three months commencing on 28 July 2006 and expiring on 27 October 2014.  
     
      
    The offences  
     
      
    4 A statement of facts was tendered by the Crown. The facts were agreed with the exception of a number of passages which were not pressed. The facts may be conveniently summarised as follows: 
     
      
       
      The victim of all of the offences was born on 1 October 1984. She is the second of four children. When her father was admitted to hospital suffering from cancer, he befriended the applicant and introduced him to his wife and children. The victim’s father died on 6 March 1992. A few days after the death, the applicant began visiting the victim’s mother and subsequently entered into a de facto relationship with her. The victim was seven years old at the time.  
       
       
      In mid 1992 the applicant introduced the victim to David Dunlop (Dunlop) a co-offender in counts 3 and 4. They were friends from when they had been in prison together. From 1992 to 2002 the applicant would often visit Dunlop at his flat and had his own set of keys to the premises. 
       
       
      Counts 1 and 2  
       
      
    5 On a date between 1 May 1992 and 2 October 1992, the victim went with the applicant to Dunlop’s flat. She was then seven years old. After she had gone to bed, the applicant woke her up and told her to remove her underwear. She was under the bed sheet. The applicant was on top of the bed sheet and started rubbing his penis and groin against her (count 1). The applicant took the victim’s hand and placed it on his penis (count 2). The victim took her hand away and said “no” as she did so. The applicant threatened to leave her at the premises if she did not comply. He told her not to tell her mother what he had done. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Counts 3, 4 and 5  
       
      
    6 Between 1 May 1992 and 2 October 1992, the victim and the applicant were at Dunlop’s flat. She was seven years old. During the evening he told her to go to the spare room. She did so and was sitting on the bed when the applicant and Dunlop entered and stood in front of the bed on either side of her. They both touched her chest through her shirt and the outside of the underwear over her vagina (count 3). The applicant removed all of the victim’s clothing and lay on top of her on the bed moving his hips. He rubbed his penis against her genital area for a long time. The victim felt the applicant’s penis harden as he did so (count 4). Dunlop was present and watched. The applicant stopped and told the victim to put her underwear back on. The three returned to the lounge room where they watched television together. Some time later the applicant sent the child to bed. Later that evening the applicant got into bed with the child and started rubbing his penis against her bottom, waking her. After a few minutes he stopped and went to sleep (count 5). Dunlop was not present at the time of this offence. 
     
      
       
      Count 6  
       
      
    7 Between 30 September 1992 and 2 October 1993 when the victim was eight years old she was alone in the bathroom of her home, taking a shower. The applicant entered the bathroom and touched the child on the outside of her vagina. 
     
      
       
      Counts 7 and 8  
       
      
    8 Between 30 September 1993 and 2 October 1994 when the victim was nine years old, the applicant took her to Dunlop’s unit. He used blankets to cover the windows of the lounge room and the bedroom where they slept. The applicant took the victim to the spare bedroom and said “Don’t put your underwear on, you don’t have to wear clothes to bed cause you will be warm enough.” He rubbed his hands over her breasts (count 7). The applicant told the child to remove her clothes, he then knelt in front of her and rubbed his penis against and around the outside of her vagina. She felt it harden as he did so (count 8). 
     
      
       
      Counts 9, 10 and 11  
       
      
    9 Between 1 December 1996 and 28 February 1997 when the victim was 12 years old, the applicant took the victim and her younger brother to Narrabri. They stayed in a cabin with the applicant and the victim sharing a double bed whilst the brother slept in a bunk. There was a curtain between the beds. On each of the three nights the applicant rubbed his penis against the victim around the outside of the child’s genitalia for some time. She felt his penis harden on each occasion. When he had finished, the applicant wiped both himself and the victim’s genital area with a face washer (counts 9, 10 and 11). 
     
      
       
      Count 12  
       
      
    10 Between 30 September 1999 and 2 October 2000, when the victim was 15 years old, she was showering in the bathroom at her home when the applicant entered. He used one of his hands to rub her breast and the other to rub the outside of her vagina. He said to her, “I love you, you are so important to me.” 
     
      
       
      Count 13  
       
      
    11 On 16 August 2002 the applicant asked the victim to go to Dunlop’s flat the next day. She agreed as when she had refused on previous occasions the applicant had become angry. The victim was 17 years old. When they arrived at Dunlop’s flat at about 6.30pm the next day, the applicant used blankets to cover windows in the lounge room and the bedroom where they slept. They watched television and then returned to bed. The victim wore pyjama shorts and a top with underpants beneath. During the evening the applicant entered the victim’s bedroom wearing his underwear. He touched her breasts underneath her pyjama top and her genitalia inside of her underpants. She could feel his penis against her leg.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances  
       
      
    12 The applicant did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Evidence of his subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of a report dated 30 July 2006 from Katie Siedler, a psychologist, and Dr John Hillman, a general practitioner, dated 7 August 2006.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was born on 23 March 1942 and was 64 years old at the time of sentence. Abandoned by his mother when he was six months old, he was raised by his paternal grandmother until he was aged ten. His father then took him to live itinerantly for some months before squatting in a National Park until he was removed into the care of Community Services. Placed in an institution for young boys, the applicant claims that he was the victim of repeated sexual abuse at the hands of Marist brothers. He ran away at about 13 years of age to live with an aunt. He left that home to wander the country, in the course of which he said, when in his mid-teens he was sexually assaulted by an older male. He moved to Victoria where he said he was further sexually assaulted by an older male for whom he worked. Ms Siedler opined that the disturbed and dysfunctional upbringing would have left the applicant as a very vulnerable individual psychologically prone to emotional and interpersonal problems. He did not attend high school. His only education since primary school was a basic motor maintenance course undertaken whilst in gaol. He had been receiving a disability pension due to poor coronary health. He has a history of ischaemic heart disease and underwent angiograms in 2000 and 2006. The Judge noted the applicant’s non-symptomatic pleurisy, occasional asthma and carpal tunnel syndrome. He receives medication for cardio-vascular management and control of cholesterol levels, asthma, and gastric reflux. The psychologist assessed the applicant as appearing to be a quite disturbed person psychologically. It was likely that he was functioning at a very low level intellectually, possibly in the borderline range. He was assessed by the psychologist to pose a moderate risk of sexual re-offence.  
     
      
       
      Prior criminal history  
       
      
    14 The Judge summarised the applicant’s criminal history as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 8 August 1984, in respect of a charge of indecent assault upon a female 12 years of age, he was sentenced to 12 months penal servitude and a concurrent period of three months penal servitude for an offence of carnal knowledge. A non-probation period of six months was specified and his need for psychiatric treatment noted. On 13 June 1986, in respect of a charge of carnal knowledge of a child under the age of ten years, he was sentenced to imprisonment for nine years with a non parole period of five years from 10 March 1986 and concluding on 9 March 1991. The sentence appears so in the antecedents included in the Exhibit A, however there is also included a letter from the Department of Corrective Services advising that in respect of that sentence, upon a redetermination with remissions under the transitional provisions of the  
        Sentencing Act 
         1989, that sentence commencing on 10 March 1986 and nominally expiring on 9 March 1995 (the overall sentence) was to expire on 4 February 1992. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There are also offences of dishonesty appearing on the offender’s record from New South Wales but these occurred in 1961 and 1962 and are of little, if any, significance. He has also a record of criminal antecedents in Victoria which include the entries against his name in New South Wales for sexual offences. His only offence in Victoria was larceny during 1972. I put that matter to one side also.”  
        (ROS p13-14) 
        
       
       
       
       
      Grounds of Appeal  
       
      
    15 The notice of appeal identifies 16 grounds. Grounds 1 to 8 and 10 and 11 have been abandoned. 
     
      
    16 Grounds 12 to 15 concern counts 9 to 12 on the indictment. Counts 9 to 11 were each expressed in the indictment as follows: that [the applicant] 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 1 December 1996 and 28 February 1997 at Narrabri in the State of New South Wales did assault [the victim] and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon [the victim], a child then under the age of 16 years, namely, 12 years.” 
        
       
      
    17 Count 12 is as follows: that [the applicant] 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 30 September 1999 and 2 October 2000 at Hebersham in the State of New South Wales, did assault [the victim] and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon [the victim], a child under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years.” 
        
       
      
    18 Counts 9 to 12 are offences contrary to s 61M(1) and 61M(3)(b) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for such an offence is seven years imprisonment.  
     
      
    19 Ground 9 of the appeal claims that the sentence with respect to count 6 is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    20 Count 6 is as follows: that [the applicant] 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 30 September 1992 and 2 October 1993 at Hebersham in the State of New South Wales did assault [the victim] and at the time of such assault did commit an act of indecency upon [the victim], a child under the age of 10 years, namely 8 years.” 
        
       
      
    21 Count 6 is an offence contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 10 years imprisonment. The Judge sentenced the applicant on this count to a term of imprisonment of eight years to commence on 28 July 2008 and expire on 27 July 2016. A non-parole period of six years was set to commence from the date of the sentence and to expire on 27 July 2014.  
     
      
    22 Ground 16 of the appeal claims that the sentence with respect to count 12 is manifestly excessive. A sentence was imposed of six years imprisonment to commence on 28 July 2011 and to expire on 27 July 2017. A non-parole period of three years and 3 months was set to commence from the date of the sentence and to expire on 27 October 2014.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the appeal  
       
      
     Grounds 12 to 15  
     
      
    23 The applicant contends that the Judge erred by finding as a matter of aggravation pursuant to s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (Crimes (SP) Act) that the applicant was in a position of trust with regard to the victim. It is not in dispute that the applicant was in a de facto relationship with the victim’s mother and was in a position of trust in relation to the victim who was in effect his stepdaughter. Section 61M(3)(c) of the Crimes Act the applicant points out specifically refers to the victim being under the authority of the offender (whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) and is, the applicant submits, an essential element of an offence contrary to s 61M(1). The applicant contends that the position of trust was a product of his position of authority which was conferred upon him by virtue of his relationship with the victim’s mother. It follows, the applicant argues, that the Judge has taken as an aggravating factor an element integral to the offence in breach of the principle expressed in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [106] and R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [22]. 
     
      
    24 Section 21A(2) of the Crimes (SP) Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        the aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        (k) the offender abused a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim, 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        The Court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    25 Factors which are elements of an offence are not to be taken into account as aggravating factors: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [106] and double counting is prohibited: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [22]-[23].  
     
      
    26 Section 61M of the Crimes Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Aggravated indecent assault  
        
       
      
      
      61M 
       (1) Any person who assaults another person in circumstances of  
       
        
         
          
          aggravation, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 7 years.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Any person who assaults another person, and, at the time of, or immediately before or after, the assault, commits an act of indecency on or in the presence of the other person, is liable to imprisonment for 10 years, if the other person is under the age of 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) In this section,  
        circumstances of aggravation 
         means circumstances in which:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons; or  
          
         
        
       
      
     (b) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years; or  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) the alleged victim is ( whether generally or at the time of the commission of the offence) under the authority of the alleged offender; or  
          
         
        
       
      
     (d) the alleged victim has a serious physical disability; or (e) the alleged victim has a serious intellectual disability.”  
     
      
    27 Subsection 3 of s 61M provides for five circumstances of aggravation for the purpose of s 61M(1) only one of which is required to be pleaded and proved: see Regina v Pearson [2005] NSWCCA 116 at [26]. The sole circumstances of aggravation pleaded in the indictment for each of counts 9 to 12 was that provided by s 61M(3)(b), namely that the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years. As that circumstance of aggravation was pleaded, it was an essential element of these offences. 
     
      
    28 The circumstance of aggravation provided by s 61M(3)(c), namely that the alleged victim is under the authority of the alleged offender was not pleaded in the indictment and it was not an essential element of these offences. The Judge was entitled, if not required, to take into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A(2)(k) of the Crimes (SP) Act that the applicant was in a position of trust in relation to the victim: see Regina v AD [2005] NSWCCA 208 at [22] and there was no error by his Honour.  
     
      
    29 The next point argued for the applicant is that his Honour erred when he said (ROS at p28): 
     
      
       
        
        “C 
        ounts nine, ten and eleven, attract application of the same aggravating factors to which I have referred including the age of the child at the time…”  
        
       
      
     And (ROS at p29): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Count 12, is an offence committed when the offender was alone. Otherwise, the same aggravating factors apply, but I exclude age as an aggravating factor…” 
        
       
      
    30 The references by the Judge to the “same aggravating factors” without further explanation, the applicant contends, suggests error of the kind identified in R v McNamara [2005] NSWCCA 195 and Dougan v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 135 in which cases this Court emphasised the need for a Judge to explain how an aggravating factor was being used on sentence.  
     
      
    31 The necessity to relate factors under s 21A of the Crimes (SP) Act to the circumstances of the offence is well established: see also R v King (2004) 150 A Crim R 409. 
     
      
    32 The Judge was faced with a difficult sentencing exercise which involved multiple offences. In a carefully considered judgment, his Honour found that the applicant had moved into the family home and had entered into a de facto relationship with the victim’s mother. In relation to counts one and two, the sentencing Judge noted ss 21A(2)(k) and (n) of the Crimes (SP) Act and found (ROS at 27): 
     
      
       
        
        “…that the offender was in a position of trust with regard to this child who was vulnerable because of her very young age. Those are matters of aggravation.” 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour clearly explained how the factors of aggravation were being used. It was unnecessary for the explanation to be repeated for each count and by stating that the “same aggravating factors” applied he identified the factors he had taken into account. 
     
      
    34 In my opinion, his Honour’s approach does not disclose error and grounds 12 to 15 of the appeal have not been established.  
     
      
       
      Grounds 9 and 16  
       
      
    35 As the applicant contends that the sentences imposed with respect to counts six and 12 are manifestly excessive, it is convenient to deal with these grounds together. 
     
      
    36 The Judge allowed a discount of 10 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea. 
     
      
    37 The notional starting point of the sentence for count 6 when a discount of 10 per cent for that plea is applied is about 8 years and 11 months. The maximum penalty for count 6 is imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    38 The notional starting point of the sentence for count 12 when a discount of 10 per cent for the plea is applied is about 6 years 8 months. The maximum penalty for count 12 is imprisonment for seven years. 
     
      
    39 These sentences, the applicant submits, are disproportionate to the gravity of the particular offences. A comparison of the undiscounted starting points as against the maximum penalties leads to the view, the applicant contends, that the sentences are consistent with sentences that should be imposed for an offence that is very much at the higher end of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of the type charged and the objective facts of the offences do not fall into that category.  
     
      
    40 The imposition of the maximum penalty for an offence is reserved for a case which can be properly characterised as falling within the worst category of offence for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451 – 452; R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [51]; R v Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 161 [13]-[15]. The notional starting points to which I have referred are appropriate, in my view, only for a case which can be properly characterised as being within or close to the worst category of an offence contrary to s 61M(2) (count 6) or s 61M(1) (count 12).  
     
      
    41 The facts of count 6 involve the applicant entering the bathroom whilst the victim was taking a shower and touching her on the outside of the vagina. She was then eight years old. The facts of count 12 also involve the applicant entering the bathroom whilst the victim was showering. On this occasion he used one of his hands to rub her breast and the other to rub the outside of her vagina. She was then 15 years old. 
     
      
    42 The touching in such circumstances outside of the victim’s vagina places the applicant’s criminality to my mind close to a worst class of case. As was said in R v Skaf [2005] NSWCCA 297 at [54] it is inappropriate to define the requirements of the category of a worst class of case nor is it necessary for a case to so qualify that the conclusion be reached that it would be impossible to conceive of a worse case.  
     
      
    43 The applicant argues that the Judge afforded too much weight to the applicant’s prior criminal record. 
     
      
    44 His Honour considered the applicant’s prior history of similar offending and remarked (ROS at 25): 
     
      
       
        
        “…Moreover the recidivism demonstrated in the present offences, considered in the light of the observations of the psychologist regarding the risk of re-offending, require careful consideration and application of the passage from  
        Veen v The Queen 
         (No 2), to which the Crown has referred me in tis submissions. 
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        The antecedent criminal history of this offender must be taken into account in determining the sentences to be imposed but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of sentences which overall would be disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct with which he is charged. However it does demonstrate that this series of offences is not an uncharacteristic aberration and it does demonstrate a continuing attitude of the rejection of acceptable standards with regard to children. In the circumstances of this case, retribution, deterrence and protection of this society indicate that significant penalties are warranted.” 
        
       
      
    45 He had earlier said (ROS at p23): 
     
      
       
        
        “The antecedents of the offender are of significance and require the application of the passage in  
        Veen v the Queen 
         (No 2) (1988) 165 CLR 464 at pages 477 and 478, see also  
        R v McNaughton 
         [2006] NSWCCA 242.”  
        
       
      
    46 The judge was plainly mindful that the applicant’s record of prior similar offending could not be taken into account in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences as to do so would infringe the principle of proportionality. His Honour was entitled to have regard to the applicant’s history of criminal offending to give more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566.  
     
      
    47 In explaining of the individual sentences to be imposed his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        I should add another comment with regard to these sentences when looking at the offences individually, and with specific reference to the increasing age of the complainant as time passed which impacts upon the extent to which her age at the time could be seen to be an aggravating factor. 
        
       
       
        
        Counterbalancing that of course is the proposition that the offending has continued over a significant period of time as part of a systematic course of conduct, and although the extent to which age of the child might diminish [has] an aggravating factor over the time, the moral culpability involved in the continuing offending must have an impact upon the sentences that are to be imposed in respect of the subsequent offences.” 
         (ROS at 33) 
        
       
      
    48 The Judge had earlier found (ROS at 24) that once the applicant became a member of the household, he engaged upon a systematic course of conduct in pursuit of his own sexual gratification at the expense of the victim who was then seven years old. Count 6 was the third discrete episode of the applicant’s sexual offending towards the victim whereas count 12 was committed when she was 15 years old. 
     
      
    49 In fixing appropriate sentences for counts six and 12, the applicant’s prior sexual offending against the victim was not to be ignored. There was no error by his Honour in affording more weight to retribution, deterrence and the protection of society. 
     
      
    50 I detect no error in his Honour’s approach to the sentencing task. I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed for counts six and 12 are manifestly excessive. Grounds nine and 16 of the appeal fail. 
     
      
    51 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

      DECISION 
       
       
      [2006] NSWIRComm 1118 
     1 This is an application by Dasheng Li (""the applicant"") for unfair dismissal by Rayna Pty Ltd (""the respondent"") pursuant to section 84 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 (""the Act""). The application shows that Mr Li was dismissed from the position of accountant on 24 August 2004, having commenced work with the respondent on 17 June 2003. 
     2 Mr Li had become concerned that he had been asked to maintain the accounts in a way that he felt was wrong. On 3 June 2004 Mr Li reported the respondent to the Australian Taxation Office (""ATO""). Prior to this, he had warned workers in the factory that they should declare their incomes to the ATO, as he said they had been paid cash in hand without any deductions for taxation.  
     3 A series of events followed in which Mr Li had various discussions with Raymond Chen, a former director of the respondent company, and his wife Nina Chen, the sole Director during the relevant period. These events culminated on 1 September 2004 when Mr Li was arrested and charged with extortion under s 100A of the Crimes Act. The decision of Magistrate Longley was handed down in the Local Court on 26 August 2005, at which time the charges were dismissed. 
     4 Whilst Ms Chen was the sole Director of the respondent company, her husband Mr Chen had delegated responsibility for the day-to-day affairs of the company in his role as Manager.  
     Application lodged out of time  
     5 Mr Li filed his application for unfair dismissal on 9 September 2005. Section 85 of the Act provides, in subsection (3), that: 
      
       
        
          
        The Commission may accept an application that is made out of time if the Commission considers there is a sufficient reason to do so, having regard in particular to:  
         
        (a) the reason for, and the length of, the delay in making the application, and 
         
        (b) any hardship that may be caused to the applicant or the employer if the application is or is not rejected, and 
         
        (c) the conduct of the employer relating to the dismissal. 
        
       
     6 The application was made one year and 16 days after the date of the alleged dismissal, being almost one year out of time. The reasons given for the delay were the charges against the applicant and proceedings in the Local Court. Mr Li was charged just one week after his dismissal and his application was filed eight days after those charges were dismissed. There was no argument by the then representative for the respondent Mr Blim of counsel, as to hardship.  
     7 During the hearing of this matter on 26 April 2006, I set out my consideration of the relevant issues and found that there was sufficient reason to accept the application out of time.  
     Arguments about evidence8 The hearing originally was set for two consecutive days, being 26 and 27 April. However, some delay occurred when the applicant sought to tender transcript of proceedings between the parties in the Local Court. A certificate under section 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 was produced in evidence, having been issued by Magistrate Longley on 29 May 2006. The certificate provided that evidence given by Raymond Chen on 19, 20 and 21 July 2005 in case no 20327457/04/2 Police v Da Sheng Li could not be used against him.  
     9 Statements made by Mr and Ms Chen in preparation for those proceedings were received into evidence before me without objection. Also part of the transcript of those proceedings not related to the testimony of Mr Chen were received into evidence.  
     Dismissal or resignation? 
     10 Mr Li admitted to Ms Chen on 3 June 2004 that he had warned the factory workers that they may be in trouble with the ATO because of the way they were paid. On 15 June Mr Li said he was called in to Mr Chen's office where Mr Chen initially tried to dismiss him but then offered him a salary increase from $50,000 to $75,000. On 24 August he said he was again called in to Mr Chen's office where he was threatened by Mr Chen. Mr Li said he left the office saying he had been sacked.  
     11 The following day Mr Li applied for an Apprehended Violence Order against Mr Chen because of alleged threats against himself and his family. That application was later withdrawn. No threats were substantiated by the applicant, and Mr Chen denied having threatened Mr Li or his family.  
     12 Mr Chen denied any knowledge of tax avoidance or tax evasion. He said that at the meeting on 15 June Mr Li had demanded a salary increase in lieu of causing trouble with the ATO. Because it was the end of the tax year and Mr Chen had no knowledge of how the accounts operated, he said he had no choice but to increase Mr Li's salary. Following a discussion on 24 August, Mr Chen said that Mr Li left his office saying to the factory workers: ""I resign because the company has serious tax problems."" Mr Chen then called Mr Li back into his office and turned on his MP3 player to record the conversation. Mr Chen provided transcript of the recording, which was in Mandarin, with a translation by an accredited interpreter, showing the speakers as R (for Raymond Chen) and L (for Mr Li, who was known at work as Luke). The translation read in part as follows: 
      
       
        
        R Luke, why did you make things so terrible? Any benefit to you? 
         
        L I don't want to talk about anything now. It is not necessary. 
         
        R Luke, is there anything good to you? 
         
        L You can talk. 
         
        R Sorry? 
         
        L Raymond…(not very clear). I do not want to talk. I cannot see any meaning to talk with you. 
         
        R That's what you said. What do you want? 
         
        L I have already told you. 1500000 dollars. 
         
        R Luke, you should not behave like this as a man. 
         
        L You either. I do not need you to teach me. 
         
        R Luke, you have a long way to go from now. So do we. You should not do thing like this. 
        
       
       
        
         Luke's mobile was ringing. (Maybe it was from his wife.) 
        
       
       
        
        L Hello. 
         
         OK. OK. 
         
         I am now in his office. You know the address. 
         
         You should call. Call the police. 
         
        R Who are you calling? 
         
        L Yes, I cannot go out. He does not allow me to. 
         
        R Go away. Nobody does not allow you to go! Luke, what do you mean? 
        
       
       
        
         Luke stood up and began to move. 
        
       
       
        
        L Raymond, if the Federal Police starts their investigation, I will report and provide the evidence. At that time the problems are yours. Whether you have broken the law or not, you can decide by yourself. OK? I do not need one cent from you. What I should get is one-year or half-year salary. 
         
        R I can pay your salary to you. 
         
         Take a seat. I do not force you to sit down. Please take a seat. 
         
        L OK. 
         
        R You made things so complicated. Is there anything good to you? 
        
       
       
        
         Luke began to move. 
        
       
       
        
        R Luke, wait! Tell me what you want. 
         
        L I have told you, haven't I? 1500000 dollars, pay me! If not, it is unnecessary for us to see each other gain. I don't need this money to live on. I can find a job. It doesn't matter, I can find a lawyer to sue you and take my time to find a job. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. 
         
        R Luke, I have consulted a lawyer too. I asked my friend about a lot of things. 
         
        L That's your business. Don't talk to me. 
         
        R Don't use this to threaten me. 
         
        L I am not threatening you. First of all, I didn't break the law. 
         
        R We are not kids. 
         
        L You are not a kid. Me either. 
         
        R What did you do such thing for? 
         
        L Nothing. Rights! 
         
        R We trusted you so much! We treated you so well! Why? 
         
        L You did not treat me as well as you said. In fact, you ruined my future. As you know, I quit my job at a professional accountant firm. If you did not need an accountant, you should tell me earlier. If you only need a receptionist, just look for a receptionist. The reason you need me to work here is to do the tax evasion for you. I refused, so you wanted to fire me. I know you too well. 
         
        R Luke, take a seat and let's have a talk. 
         
        L Raymond, no further talk. I know you too well. 
        
       
     13 Mr Li claimed that the recording had been edited, but was not specific in this allegation. The transcript of the recording, as provided in evidence, does not assist in determining what was said by Mr Li before or after the discussion in Mr Chen's office. It does, in my view, show that Mr Chen did not dismiss Mr Li. However, it shows that Mr Chen did not deny the allegations of tax evasion, allowing Mr Li to claim that he was constructively dismissed because Mr Chen made it impossible for Mr Li to continue working with the respondent. As Mr Li said, his professional reputation was at stake. 
     14 During the proceedings, Mr Chen claimed that Mr Li's role included that of receptionist because, as a small business, all office staff were required to respond to telephone calls. It was clear from the evidence of Mr Li and Ms Chen that the role for which Mr Li was recruited d not include reception duties. Mr Li understood the discussion about other duties to be a diminution of his responsibilities.  
     15 Mr Li then sent an email to a number of people, in the following terms: 
      
       
        
        Dear Creditor 
         
        As an internal accountant for WD Express and Rayna Pty ltd, I resigned today. I have reasonable ground suspicious that the company above involving serious Tax evade and I reported to the Federal Police and Australia Taxation Office. As a professional accountant and a member of CPA Australia, I have to discharge my responsibility to notice all the creditors of the above companies. 
         
        Thank you 
         
        Luke  
        
       
     16 The email correspondence sets out that Mr Li resigned, and gives the reasons for his resignation. Because of the reasons given, it is open to Mr Li to claim that his employer's conduct was the effective reason for the termination of his employment, that is, that there was a 'constructive dismissal': Allison v Bega Valley Council [1995] NSWIRComm 175.  
     Credibility of the witnesses 
     17 Whether or not the respondent's agents were acting illegally is not a matter on which I wish to comment. I respectfully agree with his Honour, Magistrate Longley, who said: 
      
       
        
        There is absolutely no doubt that the accused believed, after a relatively short period of time as the book-keeper and accountant, that there was non-compliance with the payment of the GST and excise duty, customs duty and a detailed cross-examination about those business activities was put to Mr Chen and he did not shift from his position. When one analyses his evidence, certainly in my view, it got stronger rather than weaker as time went on. 
        
       
       
        
        Whether or not he, or the company or companies, are guilty of tax evasion, that is for another time and place; certainly another organisation. Certainly there is no evidence to suggest anything has happened as a result of - and this is not in contest - the accused sending off material to the ATO. 
        
       
     18 Mr Li held a number of beliefs firmly, as evidenced throughout these proceedings. As to his demand for money from Mr and Ms Chen, the evidence shows that when Ms Chen gave him a cash cheque for $150,000 on 1 September, he asked for it to be replaced by a cheque in his name so that he could put it into his bank account. This is a not a sign of dishonesty, where one might expect a dishonest person to want to hide ill-gotten gains. It supports Mr Li's claim that he sought two years' salary so that he and his family would not suffer financial hardship while he sought another position. 
     19 The cheque for $150,000 also supports Mr Li's claim that his talk of larger sums of money were sarcastic remarks intended to express his disapproval of his employer's actions.  
     20 Ms Chen is the sole Director of Rayna Pty Ltd, a family business. Mr Chen is a Director of Depict which uses space in the same building as Rayna Pty Ltd. He had set up the company in 1994 and had ceased being a Director of the respondent company in June 2004. Mr Chen spends two weeks in Australia, then two weeks in China, where the manufacturing is done. He imports garments and accessories to Australia for sale. 
     21 Mr Chen said that he employed Mr Li when the needs of the company grew, and gave him a pay increase because he had no choice. Mr Chen said that he and his wife trusted Mr Li to keep proper accounts and records and handle all tax matters for the company. When Mr Li told him he had company records on discs which he would provide to the ATO, Mr Chen said he was concerned because he did not now what Mr Li had done with the records. Mr Chen said that he had trusted Mr Li to keep the accounts and he himself had no knowledge of any wrong-doing.  
     22 When Mr Li commenced cross-examining Ms Chen, Mr Chen appeared to be indicating to his wife the responses he wished her to give, by nodding his head. When I brought this to the attention of Mr Cheung, his solicitor at the time, Mr Chen left the court room. Whether there was an intention to do wrong, or whether Mr Chen thought he was assisting his wife, is not a matter about which I can draw a conclusion. The question at the time related only to whether or not Ms Chen had been a Director of the respondent in 1995, and her response did not affect the matters relating to the questions before the Commission. Mr Chen's willingness to leave the room satisfied me that there was no ongoing effort by either of them to collude in regard to Ms Chen's evidence.  
     23 The evidence given by both Mr and Ms Chen was consistent throughout these proceedings, and consistent with statements prepared in 2004 for other proceedings. There is no reason for me to prefer Mr Li's evidence over that of Mr and Ms Chen, or vice versa. 
     24 There were some inconsistencies between the evidence of the parties, but some may be due to different memories of conversations, and some due to different inferences made from those conversations or different intent, where the intent is not always clear from the words used.  
     25 For example, Mr Li would have the Commission accept that his pay increase from $50,000 to $75,000 was an indication of the respondent's guilt and an attempt to cover up illegal action. Mr Chen said he needed an accountant who knew the company books and could deal with end-of-year work. He though Mr Li deserved the pay rise. Ms Chen accepted her husband's decision in regard to the pay rise. While both sides of the story are plausible, there is insufficient evidence to accept the applicant's inference. 
     26 Specifically, there was nothing to cause me to doubt the veracity of any of the witnesses. The result is that where the evidence of the applicant contradicts that of the respondent's witnesses, generally I have disregarded it.  
     Conduct of the applicant 
     27 As I have said, the question of whether or not there was illegal action is not one that falls within the jurisdiction of the Commission, but clearly Mr Li believed there was and acted on this basis. 
     28 Mr Li properly reported his concerns to the ATO. However, although I accept that he was motivated by the best intentions, three actions followed which are contrary to his duty to his employer. 
     29 Firstly, Mr Li copied financial records of the business and took them home, without the knowledge or permission of his employer. He returned them to Ms Chen after his employment had been terminated, in return for the cheque for $150,000. 30 Secondly, Mr Li spoke to employees of the respondent, accusing the respondent of illegal action, namely, paying cash in hand and avoiding taxation responsibilities.31 Thirdly, on the day following the termination of his employment, Mr Li emailed clients stating that he had reported the respondent for tax evasion. 
     32 These three incidents together, if not individually, in circumstances where the allegations are unsubstantiated, show that the applicant has breached his duty of fidelity to his employer. 
     33 It is well established that the onus to make out the case is on the applicant, except in cases of summary dismissal. In Western Suburbs District Ambulance Committee v Tipping [1957] AR (NSW) 273 at 279, his Honour Justice McKeon summarised the principles in reinstatement cases to include the following: 
      
       
        
        The onus is on the applicant to establish that intervention is warranted ... he must discharge the onus which rests on him of satisfying the Commission that his is a proper case for the Commission's intervention.  
        
       
     34 That onus applies equally to a claim for unfair dismissal when reinstatement is not sought.  
     35 Mr Li asserted, but brought no evidence to support, that he was obliged as a Certified Practising Accountant to inform the employees and the creditors of his concerns. He did not claim that he was obliged to copy his employer's records onto a disc and take them home. He had no right to do so.  
     36 Mr Li received a pay rise which, he submitted, was proof of his employer's guilt. He claimed this was paid to him as a bribe. If, as Mr and Ms Chen claimed, the pay increase was negotiated as appropriate for the work and consistent with the needs of the company, then it cannot be interpreted as inferring anything negative on the part of either party. If Mr Li accepted the amount as a bribe for withhold knowledge of wrong-doing, then he himself was at fault.  
     37 When Mr Chen learned that Mr Li had spoken against him to his employees, he could have considered dismissal at that time. Instead, he increased Mr Li's pay. It is unsurprising that Mr Li continued to believe that he was correct and that the respondent was acting wrongly. Further, the transcript of the meeting on 24 August does not show that Mr Chen denied the accusations of tax evasion. However, as Mr Chen said, he recorded only part of what was discussed on that day. (In his written and oral evidence, he denied the allegations against him.) Again, it is unsurprising that Mr Li believed he had to resign. However, a finding of constructive dismissal requires that the respondent initiated action which forced the resignation, and no such action has been shown to have occurred. What Mr Li believed and what Mr Chen did may not be the same thing. 
     Conclusion 
     38 While Mr Li appears to have resigned under conditions which he believed to be wrong, he has not justified his action at the standard required of the Commission for a claim under s 84 which requires that there was a dismissal and, further, that the dismissal was harsh, unreasonable or unjust.  
     39 Whilst he claimed that he was forced to falsify the accounts of the business, and stated that he had reported the respondent to the ATO on 3 June, the conditions of work had not changed substantially since 3 June and Mr Li continued to work until 24 August, accepting a pay rise and making further demands on his employer during and after his employment.  
     40 Mr Li has not substantiated his claims that threats were made against himself or his family. 41 Having commented on the veracity of the witnesses, I am satisfied that Mr Li acted in good faith at all times, having formed a belief about the conduct of his employer. From that point on, Mr Li viewed everything his employer said from a personal, negative perspective. It is the responsibility of the Commission to view all the evidence objectively. On an objective view of the evidence, and without witnesses to relevant discussions who might provide more information, the case for unfair dismissal has not been made out.  
     42 It is true, as Mr Li submitted, that an employer does not have the right to hire a person to be a scapegoat for his wrongful actions. However, in this instance, the applicant has not proven that this was the case.  
     43 Mr Li has not fulfilled his onus to satisfy the Commission that he was dismissed unfairly or that his resignation should be characterised as a constructive dismissal. In short, this is not a proper case for the Commission's intervention.  
     44 The application is dismissed.

    3 BARR J: Jason Rutkowskyj has applied for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed in the District Court. He attended a dance party at the States Sports Centre at Homebush Bay on 10 September 2006. On three separate occasions over a period of about ten minutes he sold ecstasy tablets to under cover police officers. Immediately after the third sale he was arrested and charged with ongoing supply of a prohibited drug, 3, 4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or ecstasy. The applicant was in the business of selling on that night and there was found on him the sum of $1454, the proceeds of such sales. He made immediate admissions to the police. He told them something about his selling activities, including an account of how he had replenished his sale stocks during the night. However, he declined to name his supplier. He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court and maintained his plea of guilty before the sentencing judge. The maximum penalty for the ongoing supply of the drug is imprisonment for 20 years. There is no standard non-parole period. During sentencing the applicant asked the Court to take into account two other matters, the first his possession of 18 ecstasy tablets which were found on him at the time of his arrest and the other possession of the sum of money I have mentioned, being goods unlawfully obtained. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for three years, comprising of non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 18 months. 
     
      
    5 There is one ground of appeal, namely that the sentence is manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    6 The evidence established that the applicant was 19 years old. He had no criminal convictions. He was not a person of prior good character, however. According to the pre sentence report that was put into evidence, his adolescence was disrupted by his parents’ marital problems. They separated when he was 13 years old. He began to use cannabis at 14 and ecstasy at 16. By 17 years of age he had tried amphetamines and cocaine. Even so, he had completed high school to year 10 and had entered on a TAFE apprenticeship course in shop fitting. He had failed to complete the course but had always been employed in one or other of a variety of manual jobs. He was earning $300 per week from lawful work at the time of his arrest. Immediately before his arrest he was using ecstasy every day and amphetamines every week. He was also taking the crystalline form known as ice. His habit was costing $350 per week and he was selling drugs to fund it. Since his arrest he had, he said, ceased using illegal drugs. He told the probation and parole office that he was sorry for committing the offence. He repeated that expression before the sentencing judge, who accepted it as genuine. 
     
      
    7 His Honour noted the early frank admissions and plea of guilty. He noted that the applicant had declined to name his supplier. The Crown told the sentencing court that the applicant had since changed his mind and had expressed the intention to supply information to the investigating authorities and might even have supplied some information, but that there was no material available to the Crown to verify the value of any information provided or to be provided. His Honour noted that the applicant wished to be sentenced forthwith and not to suffer the delay which would have been necessary to enable information to be put before the Court to enable the valuation of anything the applicant might have done or promised to do. His Honour therefore decided that it was inappropriate to make any allowance for assistance to the authorities but to take account of the applicant’s desire to assist when assessing contrition and remorse. 
     
      
    8 His Honour assessed the starting point for the head sentence at five years. He acknowledged the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty, the applicant’s remorse, his young age, the fact that this would be his first time in custody and his strong prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour decided to reduce the starting sentence by 40% on account of the utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty and the applicant’s remorse. His Honour varied the prime facie non-parole component of the resulting three year sentence so as to produce the sentence that I have mentioned. 
     
      
    9 It was submitted on appeal that the five year starting sentence was too high. Although attacking the starting sentence, counsel for the applicant submitted that his Honour’s decision to discount it by 40% was within the limits of his discretion.  
     
      
    10 Ultimately, as this Court has pointed out in R v SZ [2007] NSWCCA 19, per Buddin J at [40], with whom the remaining members of the Court agreed, the focus in an appeal against sentence must be on the sentence actually imposed rather than on the notional starting point. That is not to say that it is never appropriate to have regard to the starting point, if the court can be confident of what that was. But where, as in R v SZ, the discount employed is seen to be unjustified, the starting point must be regarded as to that extent irrelevant. 
     
      
    11 The evidence of the asserted desire of the applicant to assist the authorities was of the weakest kind. He had early in the investigation declined to name his supplier. Although he had given a detailed account of his own activities, which included the disclosure of criminal activity somewhat outside the bounds of the charge ultimately laid, he gave no information likely to assist the police apprehend anyone else concerned in the supply of the drug. His Honour was correct to conclude that the evidence did not justify any discount for assistance. But in my opinion his Honour erred when, having withheld a discount for assistance of the order appropriate to those who assist the authorities, his Honour allowed a discount in much the same range, expressed as appropriate for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and for remorse. This was a discount in the range appropriate to an offender who has put himself in danger by the promise or the provision of real assistance. In my view the discount of 40% was unduly generous. See R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92, Mirza v R (2007) NSWCCA 248. 
     
      
    12 Accordingly, in my view, the starting sentence is irrelevant for present purposes. The Court should rather concentrate on the sentence actually imposed.  
     
      
    13 It was submitted that the resulting head sentence and non-parole period were manifestly excessive. It was pointed out that the applicant was 18 when he committed the offence and had no prior criminal record, that he was using the proceeds of sale to fund his own addiction, that the objective gravity of the offence was not serious, that the applicant had made full and frank admissions, that there was an indication of his preparedness to assist the police, that there was early plea of guilty, that there were good prospects of rehabilitation, that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, that he was contrite and that the Form 1 offences, representing no more than the completeness of his criminal activities on the one occasion, were not calculated to have more than a marginal effect upon the sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    14 Ultimately the submission was that, bearing in mind everything that had to be considered, the resulting sentence was too long. The sentence does not strike me in that way. 
     
      
    15 Counsel relied on the statistics published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales. There is no need here to emphasise the care with which such statistics should be approached in appeals against sentence. They show that between January 2000 and December 2006 29 out of 63 offenders dealt with for the ongoing supply of ecstasy were given gaol sentences. Sixteen of those, slightly more than one half, resulted in sentences of 36 months or longer. The maximum was five years. There are rather more recorded sentences for the ongoing supply of heroin – some 259, but they, too, show that a sentence of 36 months would have been roughly at the mid point of the distributed sentences. 
     
      
    16 To my mind the statistics allow that a lower sentence might have fallen within the limits within his Honour’s discretion, but they do not demonstrate that the one imposed fell outside that discretion. 
     
      
    17 I would grant leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Blackmore DCJ in Sydney District Court following the conviction of the appellant at trial on counts of assault, indecent assault, sexual intercourse without consent (two counts) and doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice (the justice offence). The effective term of imprisonment for all counts amounted to a total sentence of twelve years six months with a non-parole period of nine years. The appellant is now twenty four years of age. I would grant the leave sought. 
     
      
    3 The four offences first mentioned occurred on 28 January 2004 and involved the same victim whom I shall refer to from time to time as C. The justice offence occurred shortly thereafter and involved C in circumstances which I will describe. 
     
      
    4 There is no challenge to the facts found by the learned sentencing judge concerning the commission of the offences and I draw this summary from his remarks and from material which was undisputed. As at January 2004 the appellant was aged twenty and C was aged nineteen. They had been for some months engaged in a relationship which included, on occasions, consensual sexual intercourse. C wished to terminate the relationship whereas the appellant wanted it to continue. However she permitted him to remain in her apartment as he had told her that he had nowhere else to stay. 
     
      
    5 On the date mentioned an argument broke out and the appellant grasped C as she walked away from him by what was described as a “bear hug”. The squeezing involved interference with her breathing. This constituted the assault charged in the first count. For this, his Honour imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for six months dating from 8 September 2006, a commencing date which took into account some pre-sentence custody. There is no issue about the selection of the commencement date.  
     
      
    6 C went to her bedroom where her condition was that she was upset and crying. The appellant came and began to massage her. She allowed this as she believed he was trying to calm her down. However, he placed his hand into her underclothes and touched her vagina. She did not consent to this touching and it constituted the indecent assault. This was a count numbered three, count two being a count of common assault upon which the appellant was found not guilty. For the indecent assault, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of nine months from 8 September 2006.  
     
      
    7 At the time of the commission of that offence the appellant asked C if she felt like having sex. She replied in the negative and said that she wanted to go to the toilet. He carried her to the bathroom and remained there whilst she used the facility and she then got into the bath. There was some conversation but some five or ten minutes later, the appellant picked her up again and took her to the bedroom and laid her on the bed where he forced intercourse, during which he made remarks which his Honour has set out and which I do not repeat. There is an issue about his Honour’s recapitulation of some of the things said by the appellant and it is agreed that, contrary to what his Honour said, there is no evidence that the appellant said “I hope it hurts”. Nevertheless, the remarks which are not disputed can be described as cruel and spiteful. The evidence was that the appellant knew that C often experienced pain during sexual intercourse and she was crying while he forced himself upon her. 
     
      
    8 For this offence of sexual intercourse without consent the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total of seven years with a non-parole period of five years and three months dating from 8 September 2006.  
     
      
    9 After the commission of this offence the appellant left the room. C cleaned herself and went to tell him to leave. Thereafter she returned to her room but he followed her and removed some of her clothing, applied some lubricant and forced a further act of intercourse. C described this act as continuing for much longer than the previous occasion. For this offence of sexual intercourse without consent the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of six years and six months with a balance term of two years and two months dating from 8 September 2007, effectively a partial cumulation of one year upon the earlier sentences. 
     
      
    10 Each of the two counts just mentioned has a legislatively prescribed standard non-parole period of seven years. That prescription is applicable to an offence in the mid-range of seriousness for such an offence. His Honour found that the first act was not in that mid-range (nor was it at the bottom of any range) and he therefore imposed less than the standard non-parole period. He departed from the prescription to the extent of six months in imposing sentence for the second act of sexual intercourse by reason of his findings concerning some subjective matters concerning the appellant: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. 
     
      
    11 After commission of the latter offence of sexual intercourse without consent the appellant left the bedroom. C heard the front door close and she made a number of telephone calls including a call to police. 
     
      
    12 Shortly thereafter, the appellant was arrested and charged. At the same time police arranged for the issue of an apprehended violence order against the appellant in which C was nominated as the protected person. There followed events leading to the last count abovementioned. In his remarks on sentence his Honour recited some facts concerning breaches by the appellant of the apprehended violence order. However, in March 2004 C was contacted about the dissemination of a video depicting her engaged in sexual intercourse and the distribution of attachments to email of photographs of her in sexually explicit poses. C recognized some of the photography as having been taken whilst she and the appellant were holidaying in Queensland. She was a model by occupation and had appeared as an actress in some television productions. Some of the email was addressed to theatrical and professional agents.  
     
      
    13 Consequent upon being told of this dissemination of material, C contacted the appellant. He persuaded her to visit a solicitor and make a statement that she did not want “the matter” dealt with by the courts. He represented that, by her so doing, “this would go away”. The statement was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions with the suggestion that the charges be withdrawn. As is apparent this did not happen. 
     
      
    14 Subsequently the Queensland Police located the appellant’s computer and detected images on its hard drive which had been attached to the email. His Honour did not find that the appellant was responsible for the distribution of this material but he, of course, sought to make use of the fact that it had been distributed when he persuaded C to visit the solicitor. 
     
      
    15 For what I have described above and called, for convenience, the justice offence, the appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for a total of five years consisting of a non-parole period of one year and six months dating from 8 March 2014 with a balance term of three and half years. That sentence therefore was wholly cumulated upon the non-parole period specified in respect of the second offence of sexual intercourse without consent. 
     
      
    16 Accordingly, the appellant received the effective overall sentence which I first mentioned. The learned sentencing judge was also asked to deal with the call-up of the appellant for breach of a recognizance under s 558 of the Crimes Act (since repealed) which had been granted by Ducker DCJ on 18 February 2000 for an offence of attempted armed robbery committed by the appellant in company when he was aged sixteen years. It was directed that no further action be taken for breach of that bond.  
     
      
    17 His Honour made findings concerning subjective matters touching the appellant. Some aspects of these are the subject of express submission and I will deal with them accordingly. As the breach to which I have just referred shows, the appellant was not without prior record. The offence then involved was not the only matter but all previous offences occurred when the appellant was a young juvenile. 
     
      
    18 In his remarks on sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender presents to me as an immature young man who was used to getting his own way, at least up to date. Even when directly addressing me during the sentencing proceedings, he pleaded simply to be let go on parole. It appears he fails to understand the seriousness of his actions or to acknowledge that he might be the one responsible for his predicament.” 
        
       
      
    19 There is abundant evidence pointing to the immaturity of the appellant at the relevant time but, with respect to his Honour, it does not seem entirely accurate to conclude that the appellant “pleaded simply to be let go on parole”. I recognize that there is an omission in the transcription but the content of the exchange as recorded and the appellant’s references to “on the bottom” convey a plea for lenience in the setting of a non-parole period which is, of course, time in custody rather than simply being let go on parole. The transcript reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “OFFENDER: I know that – but in that context I’ve formed my life into the point now where I’ve got goals – I’ve got the future – I’ve got things to look forward to and I’d be completely content if you put me on parole for 20 years following a short .. (not transcribable).. because I know that I won’t break it. I have nothing – I have got so much to lose on this – and I don’t want to do that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I can say that – the issue that I have is whether or not he should be put on some sort of suicide watch after my sentence because the reality is that you will be receiving a lengthy custodial sentence. Years. 
        
       
       
        
        OFFENDER: I understand years but-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It could be as many as ten. 
        
       
       
        
        OFFENDER: On the bottom. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You have committed two rapes, you have committed a very serious pervert the course of justice, you have breached a bond in relation to an armed robbery offence which carries itself 25 years in gaol. You are facing many many years in gaol. So I don’t have to be the one to tell you that, but I will ultimately be the one who tells you what the bottom is and I haven’t made up my mind what it is. I want you to be fully appraised that’s the possibility. 
        
       
       
        
        OFFENDER: I’m just asking you that when you consider this that – if you can please consider that whatever you want to make the bottom if that can be in any way reduced and the top end of that – like I really and truly for the rest of my life report to whoever, I will do anything to meet those requirements, because -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: All right, I think that is what Mr Stitz has told me he wants as well – so that was the submission – we talk about – we talk in terms of things like special circumstances – you don’t know what we’re talking about but that’s what it means – it means that the bottom is reduced and the top’s if you like extended out. So that submission was made as well. 
        
       
       
        
        OFFENDER: My point is ten years doesn’t just destroy my life it destroys Mel’s as well.” 
        
       
      
    20 The reference to Mel is to a Ms Ballantyne with whom the appellant had formed a relationship whilst awaiting trial. She gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings but its weight must be regarded as somewhat diminished by her stance that she stated that she did not accept that the allegations of the complainant were in fact true. It was not explored whether she had reached this conclusion as a result of her own opinion of the appellant’s nature, or from anything the appellant had told her. 
     
      
    21 His Honour described the subjective circumstances of the appellant as “on one level quite straightforward and on another, quite complicated”. He accepted that there were unresolved psychological issues which needed to be addressed both before and after release from prison. Clinical test results had indicated elevated levels for “dramatising, egotistic and unruly personality patterns, social insensitivity and family discord”. The appellant was estranged from his family at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    22 Mr Ramage QC for the appellant presented argument under four formulated grounds. Ground 1 asserted that the whole sentence was unduly harsh and severe. He submitted that the effective sentence of a total of twelve and half years with at least nine years to be served before possible parole represented a crushing burden upon a comparatively young man who was committed to prison for the first time. I consider that there is substance in that submission.  
     
      
    23 In particular, it was argued that the sentence of five years for the justice offence was manifestly excessive. Reference was had to the statistics collected by the Judicial Commission. A survey of eighty six cases showed that, of these, fifty three offenders received sentences of less than full time imprisonment. Of the remaining thirty three who were so sentenced, the highest term was five years and this related to a single offender and it can be deduced that it refers to the appellant. Another received a sentence of four years and the remainder terms of less than that. 
     
      
    24 Great care needs to be taken in applying statistics derived from cases of which no facts are known. It needs always to be borne in mind that the maximum sentence which can apply to a worst case or worst offender is that prescribed by Parliament and not the upper limit of any statistical range. Nevertheless, whilst I would assess the criminality involved in the appellant’s actions as of a high order, the pattern of sentence revealed by the statistics is not to be ignored, and I consider the submission of excess is made out particularly when one observes that the present sentence exceeds by 25 percent the next highest sentence received by any other offender incorporated in the survey. 
     
      
    25 An express submission was made that “higher sentences” should be reserved for those who endeavour to suborn those involved in the administration of justice including judges and law enforcement officers. I would reject that proposition. Each case needs to be assessed in its particular circumstances and, as a generality, the attempt to suborn a complainant, who may succumb, could very well be misconduct more serious than an attempt directed at those whose callings make it more likely that they would not only resist the attempt but report it to authority and thereby ensure that the offender is called upon to answer. 
     
      
    26 The next aspects argued in relation to this ground challenged the accumulation of the entire sentence for the justice offence upon earlier sentences and the implementation of his Honour’s findings of special circumstances. It is convenient to deal with these aspects together. The attempt to suborn C into, in effect, recanting her complaint was separated from the agglomeration of events on 28 January in time and in nature. It is true that there is a connection in the sense that what was attempted related to the crimes committed on that day and it does not follow that there is a demonstrated error in his Honour’s decision not to direct that any concurrency of sentence service be permitted. Whether sentences are to be cumulated needs to be considered in the context of totality. Thus an offender needs to be punished for separate acts of offending, on the other hand it is appropriate to consider whether there is some unification of misconduct so that entirely cumulated sentences do not exceed the proper reflection of total criminality. In R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; [2006] 164 A Crim R 481 the court stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although it has been held that a determination of the extent, if any, that a sentence is to be served cumulatively with another sentence is an exercise of discretion on which minds might differ,  
        R v Hammoud 
         [2000] 118 A Crim R 66, that discretion is generally circumscribed by a proper application of the principle of totality”. 
        
       
      
    27 Although I detect no error in his Honour’s exercise of discretion that is not to say, if for other reasons the Court comes to resentence, discretion may not be exercised differently. 
     
      
    28 Attention was drawn to the learned sentencing judge’s not being satisfied that the appellant was responsible for the distribution of the images of the complainant. As I have said, the appellant nevertheless sought to use the fact of that distribution, and his claim to make the distribution cease, as a lever to induce C to recant her complaint. 
     
      
    29 Although I have above expressed my views about the total sentence term of five years for the justice offence, it is noted that his Honour specified a non-parole period of one year and six months with a balance term of three years six months in order to give effect to a finding of special circumstances for the appellant. The expired sentences for assault and indecent assault can be ignored for present purposes. Each of the sentences for sexual intercourse without consent was divided so that the balance term was exactly one third of the non-parole period and thus there had been applied precisely the statutory formulation and no benefit in those divisions was granted to the appellant consequent upon the finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    30 The division of the sentence for the justice offence reversed the statutory proportion but the consequence to the overall imposition differed from the statutory ratio by only about 3 percent. His Honour did not find that the appellant was entitled to the benefit of his special circumstances only in respect of the justice offence count. It would be difficult to justify such a discrimination. In my view the outcome in overall proportion between an effective nine year non-parole period against a total term of twelve years six months is such that, without elaboration as to how it was reached, it should be concluded that there is latent error and this Court should intervene on this issue.  
     
      
    31 I consider ground one is made out in the aspects which I have indicated. 
     
      
    32 Ground two complained that his Honour failed “adequately or correctly” to take into account the mental and emotional state of the appellant.  
     
      
    33 The ground is sought to be supported by reference to a report from a psychiatrist Dr Jonathon Carne who saw the appellant on 23 August 2006. His opinion was that the appellant displayed features of a personality disorder with anti-social and narcissistic traits. I have also set out some psychological conclusions which were before his Honour. Dr Carne commented that alcohol clearly played a significant role in events but the events referred to were rather focussed on attempts at self harm rather than the offences themselves. 
     
      
    34 It is significant to note that Dr Carne’s report came into evidence originally in a voir dire hearing to determine the admissibility of what was described as a suicide note by the appellant which contained material upon which the Crown sought to rely as an admission. The Crown submission to this Court is that it is therefore not surprising that Dr Carne’s report really did not address the role of any mental condition of the appellant in his commission of the offences and the submission is correct.  
     
      
    35 Insofar as there was relevant diagnosis, his Honour stated that he had made some allowance for the condition but he regarded it as a minor matter. His conclusion has not been shown to be erroneous and I would reject this ground. 
     
      
    36 The third ground asserted that his Honour failed to take into account the youth of the appellant. It is plain that his Honour was alert to the appellant’s youth. In dealing with submissions he said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given my view as to his immaturity, he may in fact be seen to be younger than his chronological age despite his apparent intelligence.” 
        
       
      
    37 The fourth ground complained that his Honour erred in determining that the appellant had shown no remorse for his actions. There were some aspects to matters argued in support of grounds 3 and 4 which are common and it is convenient to discuss them together. 
     
      
    38 His Honour stated (specifically in relation to the second act of forced sexual intercourse):  
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has completely denied the offence. He has shown no remorse for his actions whatsoever.” 
        
       
      
    39 In his written submissions senior counsel for the appellant stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Defending a criminal trial is not inconsistent with regret or remorse.” 
        
       
       
      No authority is cited for this proposition which requires some qualification. Of course remorse is necessarily harboured subsequent to the offence and can be available as a mitigating factor but a question of timing may be germane.  
       
      
    40 In the text D Thomas, Principles of Sentencing (2nd edn (1979) Heinemann) the author states: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles governing the extent to which a sentencer may take into account the offender’s behaviour during the course of the proceedings against him are well settled. A plea of guilty may properly be treated as a mitigating factor, indicating remorse, and will justify a reduction in the sentence below the level appropriate to the facts of the offence; but the defendant who contests the case against him, while not entitled to  
        that 
         mitigation, may not be penalized for the manner in which his defence has been conducted by the imposition of a sentence above the ceiling fixed by the gravity of the offence.” (page 50, emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    41 It can be contemplated that remorse may become manifest other than from a plea of guilty. It is a paradox in the current case that some material upon which the appellant now relies as supporting a claim for mitigation of sentence on account of remorse are matters which were relied upon by the Crown at trial in proof of guilt and in that context were not readily accepted by the appellant. I see no reason, however, why the appellant cannot now point to them in the context of the sentence issues. 
     
      
    42 C gave evidence that he telephoned her not long after the events and said, inter alia, that “he was very sorry for what he had done” (T123) and that he would explain matters in a letter which he had left as he intended to suicide. This is the letter to which I have made earlier reference. There was evidence of an unsuccessful attempt at suicide.  
     
      
    43 The letter was admitted into evidence and contained words which the Crown relied upon as constituting both an apology and an admission. The appellant was cross examined about this and about a text message which he sent on the very night of 28 January after he had left the apartment in which he said that he was hopeful that there would not be any problems between them. He denied that this was a reference to having “raped C” but said that he was referring to the fact that they had had a fight and he had left the apartment. 
     
      
    44 Some focus of the cross examination of the appellant was the Crown assertion that C wished to terminate the relationship but the appellant was obsessed with his passion for her. 
     
      
    45 His Honour’s remarks on sentence do not reveal what analysis he undertook of this material in forming his conclusion that the appellant had shown no remorse for his actions whatsoever. The telephone call to C and the letter were capable of being assessed as manifestations of remorse although it was not obligatory so to view them. It is inevitably a difficult task to discriminate between apparent remorse for the commission of an offence and the sorrow which an offender feels on account of the predicament in which he or she finds himself or herself. 
     
      
    46 The post offence conduct of the appellant which I have described, when perceived as conduct of a person less mature than his calendar years (as his Honour found) required some attention but that is not to say that it can be concluded that his Honour’s finding was necessarily erroneous. As for other reasons I consider that this Court should intervene and proceed to resentence, the proposition of error need not be further examined. 
     
      
    47 An effective sentence of twelve years and six months with a non-parole period of nine years imposed on an immature young man entering custody for the first time for a series of offences consisting of an outbreak of criminality on the one day and the later crime which in effect sought to avoid the consequences of that criminality is in my opinion so severe as to be in the category of manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    48 It is not necessary to recapitulate the facts. I consider that there should be some amelioration of the sentences for sexual intercourse without consent and some concurrency of service of these sentences with the sentence for the justice offence. At this point, when resentence is being imposed, there can be taken into account subsequent evidence tending to show remorse and in the affidavit of the appellant sworn 28 November 2007 he states: “In gaol I have had a great deal of time to reflect on my conduct. I regret my actions a great deal and the harm that I caused”. Whilst the statement is less than elaborate, if added to the matters which I have noted when discussing grounds three and four, it is appropriate to assess the appellant as harbouring some remorse for his crimes. In reimposing sentence, I would give more perceptible effect to his Honour’s finding of special circumstances and I would depart from the standard non-parole periods for the reasons indicated by his Honour. 
     
      
    49 As I have said the sentences for assault and indecent assault are now expired. They were entirely concurrent with the sentence for the first offence of sexual intercourse without consent and no action is needed in respect of them. The sentences which I propose and the orders for partial concurrency of service are designed to reflect ultimately the totality of criminality involved in the particular circumstances. 
     
      
    50 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (2) Appeal allowed and the sentences imposed on counts 4, 5 and 6 quashed. 
       
      (3) In lieu thereof the appellant sentenced: 
       
        
        (a) On count 4: (sexual intercourse without consent) To imprisonment consisting of a fixed term of four years commencing on 8 September 2007 and expiring on 7 September 2011. 
         
        (b) On count 5: (sexual intercourse without consent) To imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of four years commencing on 8 September 2008 and expiring on 7 September 2012 with a balance term of three years commencing on 8 September 2012 and expiring on 7 September 2015. 
         
        (c) On count 6: (doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice) To imprisonment consisting of a fixed term of two years commencing on 8 September 2006 and expiring on 7 September 2008.  
        
       
      (4) The effective encompassing term consists of a fixed term/non-parole period of six years together with a balance term of three years. Where non-parole periods have not been set, it is to enable construction of appropriate overall terms. The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole is specified as 7 September 2012. 
       
      
    51 HARRISON J: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgment of his Honour Grove J. I agree with his Honour’s conclusion that the whole sentence was unduly harsh. I agree also with the submission on behalf of the applicant, which his Honour accepted, that the effective sentence of a total of twelve and a half years with at least nine years to be served before the possibility of parole represents a crushing burden upon a comparatively young man facing prison for the first time. 
     
      
    52 I differ from his Honour, however, to the extent to which I consider that the matters that support the conclusion that the original sentences on counts 4, 5 and 6 should be quashed are to be reflected in any new sentences that are to be imposed. 
     
      
    53 It is clear that these offences all spring from the applicant’s obsession with C. That obsession produced disastrous consequences commencing on 28 January 2004. They are still continuing to this day. They extend not only to the applicant and to C, but also to their respective families and beyond. They include but are not limited to the sentences imposed on the applicant. I suspect that the crushing effect upon the applicant of the sentences that were imposed will not have been confined to him. 
     
      
    54 The offences that comprise counts 4 and 5 are serious. In imposing sentences that reflect their criminality it is necessary to deal with each separately and to ensure that the extent, if at all, to which they are to be served concurrently does not derogate from that seriousness. By the same token, the particular circumstances in which they were committed also inform the approach that ought to be taken in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    55 Both offences occurred upon the same day and at the same place which was then, if only temporarily, the residence of the applicant and C. The offences occurred within a short space of time and, on one view of the matter, could be seen as part of a single, continuing course of conduct. There were differences between them, which the learned sentencing judge sought to reflect in the non-parole periods that he imposed in each case. The fact that the second offence occurred at all is one curious aspect of all of the events of that day. It re-emphasises as a significant part of what occurred, and in a way that recognises the unpleasantness of C’s ordeal, not only the relative youth of the applicant but the relative youth of C as well. 
     
      
    56 I also consider that the justice count is a direct and intimate product of the events of 28 January 2004. Viewed at a distance, the particulars of that count do little to attract a sympathetic evaluation of the applicant’s position. However, it seems to me to be inappropriate, if the particularly strong subjective factors favourable to the applicant’s case are actually to be taken into account, to do no more than acknowledge them faintly in the calculation of a proper sentence. I accept immediately the caution about the reliance that can be placed upon sentencing trends and statistics to which his Honour Grove J has adverted. On the other hand, there is no doubt in the present case that at the time the applicant was sentenced for the justice offence his sentence represented the high water mark for cases of its kind. I do not consider that it warranted such a status then or now.  
     
      
    57 Having regard to the principles of deterrence, punishment, and rehabilitation, and particularly in this case as well to the multi-faceted concept of retribution, I consider that a lesser overall sentence is warranted. I remain concerned, having regard to the principle of totality, that even the effective total non-parole period that I have proposed may itself amount to a crushing burden on this applicant in the particular circumstances of this case.58 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed and the sentences imposed on counts 4, 5 and 6 quashed. 
       
       
      (3) In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced: 
       
        
         
        (a) On count 4: (sexual intercourse without consent) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years dating from 8 September 2006 and expiring on 7 September 2009 with a balance term of 2 years commencing on 8 September 2009 and expiring on 7 September 2011. 
        
       
        
       
        
        (b) On count 5: (sexual intercourse without consent) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years dating from 8 March 2007 and expiring on 7 March 2010 with a balance term of 2 years commencing on 8 March 2010 and expiring on 7 September 2012. 
         
         
        (c) On count 6: (doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice) to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 1 year to date from 8 September 2009 and expiring on 7 September 2010 with a balance term of 1 year commencing on 8 September 2010 and expiring on 7 September 2011. 
        
       
       
      (4) The effective encompassing term consists of a non-parole period of 4 years together with a balance of term of 1½ years. The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole is specified as 7 September 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: The applicant, by application for leave to appeal dated 26 May 2003, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court of New South Wales (his Honour Judge Finnane QC) on 11 October 2002. The sentences were imposed following convictions in two separate trials. 
     
      
    3 The first trial related to offences committed on 10 August 2000 at Northcote Park, Greenacre (referred to as the “Greenacre offences”). The victims of the offences were two girls aged 17 and 18 years, they being in their last year of high school. 
     
      
    4 In a second trial, the applicant was convicted of four offences alleged to have been committed by him on 30 August 2000 (referred to as the “Bankstown offences”). 
     
      
    5 Following a re-trial which this Court ordered (Regina v Ghanem & Ors [2004] NSWCCA 36), the applicant was acquitted of the Bankstown charges. 
     
      
    6 The overall aggregate sentence imposed in respect of all of the offences in both trials resulted in terms of imprisonment of 40 years with a non-parole period of 26 years. 
     
      
    7 Mr Game SC, who appeared before this Court for the applicant, succinctly stated the issue to be whether the Court should, in effect, impose the same sentence as was imposed by this Court on the applicant’s co-offender, Hajeid, namely, a non parole period of 12 years with a head sentence of 17 years or whether the applicant has established a basis for imposing a lesser non-parole period and a lesser head sentence. 
     
      
    8 The primary submission made on behalf of the applicant was that the appropriate total sentence involved partial accumulation of sentences in respect of the offences against Ms A and Ms B. Whilst the sentencing judge ordered that they be partly cumulative, he effectively made the non-parole periods cumulative. The sentences in respect of the offences against Ms B did not begin until after the expiry of the non-parole period of eight years in respect of the offences against Ms A. 
     
      
    9 The Crown accepts in this appeal that this Court must necessarily re-sentence the applicant due to his acquittal of the Bankstown offences. The critical question, as the Crown observed, is whether there should be a further reduction of the overall aggregate head sentence in respect of the Greenacre matters. 
     
      
    10 The Crown conceded in light of the judgment of this Court in Regina v Hajeid [2005] NSWCCA 262, Grounds 2, 3 and 5 in the present application. Accordingly, it accepted that there must be a further reduction in the sentences imposed, and that, for practical sentencing purposes, the cases of the co-offender, Belal Hajeid and the applicant are indistinguishable. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing background 
       
      
    11 The applicant was sentenced in respect of the Greenacre offences to a total period of imprisonment of 23 years with a non-parole period of 15 years in respect of the following offences, the sentences to commence on 17 November 2001. 
     
      
       
      (a) Count 1: detaining Ms A for advantage under s.90A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (five years, commencing 17 November 2001 and concluding 16 November 2006); 
       
       
      (b) Count 4: assaulting Ms A under s.61 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (two years, concurrent with sentences for Counts 1, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, commencing 17 November 2001 and concluding on 16 November 2003). 
       
       
      (c) Counts 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9: aggravated sexual intercourse with Ms A without consent under s.61J(1) of the

      (e) Count 11: assaulting Ms B (two years, commencing 16 November 2009 and concluding 15 November 2011). 
       
       
      (f) Count 12: aggravated sexual intercourse with Ms B without consent (15 years, with a non-parole period of seven years, commencing 16 November 2009 and concluding 15 November 2024, with a non-parole period concluding on 15 November 2016). 
       
       
      The facts 
       
      
    12 The material events may be summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On the evening of Thursday 10 August 2000, the complainants were together browsing in the shops in the mall at Chatswood. Around 9.00 pm, they were approached by a group of eight young men, which included the applicant. They agreed to accompany the young men on the understanding that they would be given some marijuana to smoke at a nearby location and that thereafter they would be given a lift to their homes. They got into a white van with four of the men while the remaining four, including the applicant, got into a red car. Before leaving the car park of the shopping centre, the men in the red car spoke in Arabic with the men in the white van. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The two vehicles travelled from Chatswood to Northcote Park, Greenacre. During the course of the journey, the occupants of the white van maintained mobile telephone contact with the occupants of the red car. The white van was the first to arrive at the park. By this time it was after 11.00 pm. The park was an in [sic] isolated location unfamiliar to the complainants. 
        
       
       
        
        3. On arrival, Bilal Skaf to Ms A to one part of the park while a co-offender took Ms B to another part of the park. Subsequently, both complainants were sexually assaulted by being forcibly required to engage in acts of oral intercourse with various of the young men. Ms A had been assaulted in this fashion by Bilal Skaf before the red car, in which the applicant was travelling, arrived at the scene. 
        
       
       
        
        4. After Bilal Skaf had forced oral sex on Ms A, the four men from the red car ran towards her. One crash tackled her. When on the ground, some of the men kicked her about the legs. One of them picked her up on his shoulder and threw her into the bushes. The applicant was one of those men and he participated in these assaults on her. This led to his conviction on the fourth count on the indictment. The assaults were violent and were found to have caused fear and alarm in Ms A. 
        
       
       
        
        5. From this time until he left the area, the applicant jointed his co-offenders in detaining Ms A for advantage and in detaining Ms B for advantage. 
        
       
       
        
        6. After Skaf again had oral sex with Ms A a second time, the four men, including the applicant, approached her, threatened her after which she had non-consensual oral sex with four men (including Hajeid and the applicant). 
        
       
       
        
        7. Ms B was dragged by a male to the toilet block who had oral sex with her. Later, the four men in the red car surrounded her and demanded oral sex. Hajeid then grabbed her and forced her to have oral sex with him. The applicant, as noted earlier, was convicted of aggravated sexual intercourse with Ms B without consent.” 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant appealed against conviction in respect of the Greenacre offences. That appeal was dismissed on 7 April 2004: Regina v Skaf & Ors [2004] NSWCCA 74. 
     
      
    14 The applicant’s successful appeal against the convictions on the Bankstown charges was allowed by this Court on 7 April 2004 and a new trial ordered: Regina v Skaf & Ors [2004] NSWCCA 36. 
     
      
    15 The hearing of the present application was stood over pending the outcome of that re-trial. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    16 The grounds of appeal relied upon in the application were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The factual foundation for sentencing has materially changed. The applicant was sentenced on the basis that he had been found guilty of sexual offences at Greenacre on 10 August 2000 and Bankstown on 30 August 2000. He was subsequently acquitted of the offences at Bankstown. The change in circumstance means that the sentencing judge sentenced on a factual basis which can now be seen to have been erroneous. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The parity principle requires that the applicant’s sentence be reduced at least to reflect the sentence given to his co-offender in  
        R v Hajeid 
         [2005] NSWCCA 262. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentencing judge erred in applying the principle of totality for the offences. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The sentencing judge failed properly to take into account the applicant’s youth. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: The factual foundation for sentencing has changed 
       
      
    17 This ground asserts that the sentencing judge, having dealt with the Bankstown and Greenacre offences together, employed a factual matrix that led to findings that would not or could not have been made had the facts concerning the Greenacre offences only been under consideration. 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge concluded that the applicant was guilty of serious criminal conduct and he was sentenced on this basis. This was evident from the following observation by the sentencing judge (remarks on sentence, p.29):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The men concerned were part of an organised criminal conspiracy, pursuant to which the three victims were kidnapped, defiled and, in the case of Ms C, then passed from group to group to be abused, insulted and defiled.”  
        
       
      
    19 The submission was (paragraph 10 of the applicant’s written submissions):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Viewed without the Bankstown offences, the Greenacre offences no longer fit this description.” 
        
       
      
    20 In my opinion, this submission must be rejected. The facts as summarised above indicate that the applicant, from the time the events started until he and the others left the Greenacre site, was present and acted not alone but in concert with his co-offenders in accordance with an agreement between them to commit sexual offences upon both Ms A and Ms B. In particular:- 
     
      
       
      (a) He was one of eight men who approached Ms A and Ms B at Chatswood and persuaded them to accompany them in two cars. 
       
       
      (b) The van together with the red car in which the applicant travelled, proceeded together and were driven close to one another to the Greenacre park. 
       
       
      (c) The sentencing judge made a finding that the plan between the eight men had been agreed upon before the van got to the Greenacre park. They had communicated with one another during the course of travel, inter alia, using mobile phones. 
       
       
      (d) A factual finding was also made that the crimes committed by the applicant and his companions were  
      “carefully planned and well co-ordinated” 
      . The applicant and Skaf engaged in mobile telephone communication when the van stopped at Stanmore. By this time, Ms A had been sexually assaulted in the car by another male travelling in the van. On the way to the park, Skaf was pressing Ms A to have sex with him. 
       
       
      (e) After Skaf had, for the first time, sexually assaulted Ms A, the applicant and others demonstrated the fact of an existing plan to detain and sexually assault Ms A by rushing towards her and physically assaulting and restraining her. 
       
      
    21 The Crown submitted that, had the sentencing judge’s exercise been confined only to the 10 Greenacres offences, ignoring the Bankstown matters, his findings in respect of the objective seriousness of the offences and the subjective factors would have been the same. The Crown submitted that the question is not whether the Greenacre matters “affected” the judge’s conclusion, but whether he would have come to any different conclusion. 
     
      
    22 It is plain that the many Bankstown offences against Ms A and Ms B involved, as the sentencing judge described it, an organised criminal conspiracy and the acts carried out by the applicant and his co-offenders pursuant to that conspiracy were properly categorised as involving criminality of the highest order for the type of offences in question. That conclusion, in my view, stands, notwithstanding the change in the factual basis associated with the Bankstown matters. 
     
      
    23 The applicant also contended that, had the sentencing judge only had the Greenacre incidents to consider (and not those alleged to have occurred at Bankstown), it is likely that he would not have found the applicant to be “a medium to high risk” of re-offending. It was emphasised in submissions for the applicant that he had no prior criminal history. 
     
      
    24 In the remarks on sentence, the following is recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “He has been assessed by Juvenile Justice officers as falling within the medium to high range risk of re-offending.” 
        
       
      
    25 The sentencing judge then added (p.25):- 
     
      
       
        
        “I would accept their opinions on this matter in preference to the opinions expressed by Mr John Taylor, psychologist … because the Juvenile Justice report was based on extensive background checks and did not just rely on what the offender said …”  
        
       
      
    26 The Juvenile Justice report was dated 22 August 2002. It was based on five interviews with the offender and one with his family. The authors of the report had information from the Department of Education, from his previous employer and from the psychologist, Ms Hilton and the Case Manager and Manager Kariong Juvenile Justice Centre. The authors also had the report of Mr Taylor dated 29 July 2002. 
     
      
    27 The risk assessment referred to in the Juvenile Justice report was, in part, made using the Static 99 statistical instrument. On that assessment, the applicant was rated in the medium/high category of sexual offending. Dynamic risk factors were also identified. These included distorted attitudes and beliefs about the offences, an unwillingness to discount the explanation that the victims may have consented and an inability to place appropriate responsibility with the other offenders for their role. It was also noted that the applicant had a poor motivation to address his offending behaviour. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 2 and 3: Parity and totality 
       
      
    28 The applicant’s co-offender, Hajeid, was originally sentenced to sentences which in the aggregate amounted to 23 years’ imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of 15 years. On appeal, on 16 September 2005, this Court (Studdert Bell and Latham JJ) re-sentenced him to an aggregate term of 17 years’ imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of 12 years. 
     
      
    29 Hajeid was convicted of 10 offences, seven against Ms A and three against Ms B, particulars of which (including sentences as originally imposed by sentencing judge) are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Count 1: detaining Ms A for advantage under s.90A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for five years). 
       
       
      (b) Count 4: common assault of Ms A under s.61 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years). 
       
       
      (c) Counts 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9: aggravated sexual intercourse with Ms A without consent under s.61J(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (in each case, sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of eight years). 
       
       
      (d) Count 2: detaining Ms B for advantage under s.90A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for five years). 
       
       
      (e) Count 3: aggravated sexual intercourse with Ms B without consent under s.61J(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (sentenced to a term of imprisonment for 15 years with a non-parole period of seven years). 
       
       
      (f) Count 11: common assault of Ms B under s.61 of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years). 
       
      
    30 It was noted in the applicant’s written submissions (paragraph [17]) that the sentencing judge expressly found the applicant’s criminality in respect of the offences committed at Greenacre was equal to the criminality of Hajeid. 
     
      
    31 This Court determined that there was an accumulation error in respect of the sentences imposed. The offences formed part of a single episode of offending and that fact together with the fact that it involved two victims called for a degree of accumulation. As stated in the Court’s judgment, at issue was whether an accumulation of eight years produced an overall sentence that was manifestly excessive, at [45]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Taking into account the pattern of sentencing for s.61J(1) offences reviewed in  
        AEM 
        , this contention has been made good. An effective sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment imposed on a young man of prior good character for the totality of this criminal behaviour in our view exceeds the bounds of discretion. The judge erred in imposing sentences for the s.61J(1) offences that were, at the least, at the top of the range and in then determining to wholly accumulate the sentences for the Ms B offences on the sentences for the Ms A offences.” 
        
       
      
    32 The Crown submitted that for practical sentencing purposes, the cases of the co-offender, Belal Hajeid, and the applicant were indistinguishable. 
     
      
    33 Before examining the particular offences in relation to Ms A and Ms B, the following matters are relevant to the issue of parity and accumulation:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The applicant in the present case was aged 17 years and three months when the offences took place and was 19 years and five months when sentenced. He is presently aged 24 years and four months (date of birth 24 May 1983). 
       
       
      (b) His co-offender, Hajeid, was 18 years and nine months at the time of the offences. 
       
       
      (c) The applicant and Hajeid had both been of prior good character. 
       
       
      (d) There were six offences committed respectively in each case by the applicant and by Hajeid of aggravated (in company) sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s.61J(1). 
       
       
      (e) The applicant was principal in respect of Count 9 (Ms A). Hajeid was the principal in respect of Count 12 (Ms B). In respect of the remaining five s.61J(1) offences, they were each accessories. 
       
       
      (f) As noted earlier, for sentencing purposes, the sentencing judge could not distinguish between the applicant and Hajeid (remarks on sentence pp.20.9, 30). 
       
      
    34 In re-sentencing the offender in Hajeid (supra), the observations made by the Court included the following:- 
     
      
       
      • It was appropriate to distinguish between the s.61J(1) offences in which the applicant had been an accessory from the offence committed on Ms B to which he was a principal. 
       
       
      • The offence committed by the offender under s.61J(1) on Ms B was a serious offence which was carried out so as to dominate and humiliate Ms B. The offender was the principal and was, accordingly, deserving of severe punishment for it. 
       
      
    35 In structuring the sentences in Hajeid (supra), the Court adopted the following approach:- 
     
      
       
      (a) It was appropriate that the s.90A offence of detaining Ms A for advantage be served concurrently with the sentences for the sexual assaults committed against Ms A since the detention was bound up with those offences. 
       
       
      (b) The assault which preceded the sexual assaults was a most serious instance of common assault. It was appropriate for the sentencing judge to impose the maximum sentence for that offence. The Court added that there should be a degree of accumulation between the sentence for the assault and the sexual assaults that followed. 
       
       
      (c) The sentences for the offences involving Ms B should be partly accumulated on the sentences for the offences involving Ms A. 
       
       
      (d) As between them, the sentences for the offences involving Ms B should all be served concurrently. 
       
       
      (e) No non-parole period would be fixed for the sentences imposed on Counts 1, 2, 4 and 11, having regard to the sentences that were to be imposed in relation to the remaining counts in the indictment. 
       
      
    36 I am of the opinion, having regard to the facts concerning the offences against s.61J(1) to which the applicant was an accessory, that the accessorial offences committed by him can only be considered as involving extremely serious offences. I consider that this is similarly reflected with his co-offender in this Court imposing in Hajeid a slightly longer sentence in respect of the count where Hajeid was the principal (13 years with a non-parole period of eight years) compared to those where he was an accessory (11 years with a non-parole period of seven years). 
     
      
    37 In the applicant’s supplementary written submissions dated 27 August 2007, it was submitted that the Court should have regard to the decision in Regina v S [2005] NSWCCA 323. The Court, in those proceedings, was composed of the same members as in Hajeid (supra) (Studdert, Bell and Latham JJ). On appeal, the Court re-sentenced S to 16 years imprisonment, with an aggregate non-parole period of 10 years. In respect of offences against Ms A and Ms B, he received a sentence of 10 years with a non-parole period of five years. 
     
      
    38 It was submitted that the degree of concurrency was substantially greater in respect of the terms of imprisonment imposed on S than for offences against Ms A and Ms B than they were for the applicant’s sentence or Hajeid’s sentence. 
     
      
    39 It was submitted that in light of S’s sentence, that parity principles required a further reduction in the applicant’s sentence than that given to Hajeid. 
     
      
    40 I do not accept that the sentence as structured and imposed in S (supra) has the effect contended for on behalf of the applicant. Although the offences committed by S involved both Ms A and Ms B, there is not otherwise a sufficient similarity which would warrant a further reduction in the applicant’s sentence. 
     
      
    41 S was charged and convicted of six offences arising out of the detention and sexual assault of the two complainants on 10 August 2000 whilst S was in the company of a number of his co-offenders. 
     
      
    42 Counts 1 and 2 of the indictment against S charged him with detaining Ms A and Ms B for advantage contrary to s.90A of the Crimes Act. Counts 3, 4 and 5 on the indictment each charged S with one count of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s.61J of the Crimes Act. S was a principal in respect of Count 3 involving Ms A and he was an accessory in respect of Count 4 which also involved Ms A and he was an accessory in respect of Count 5 which involved Ms B. There was a sixth count involving a charge of robbery in company. 
     
      
    43 In contrast, in the present proceedings, the applicant was convicted in respect of five offences of aggravated sexual assault with Ms A without consent under s.61J of the Crimes Act of which he was principal in respect of Count 9. There were other differences, as emphasised in the Crown’s oral submissions. S was seven months younger than the applicant and the Court had regard to S’s deformity and his lack of self-esteem and poor social skills associated with that deformity. S also pleaded guilty and obtained a 25% discount on sentence. Additionally, the sentencing judge took into account remorse in stating “I am entitled to consider that he is in the process of working through remorse and contrition …”. 
     
      
    44 I am, accordingly, of the opinion that the sentences imposed in S (supra) are not relevant in applying the parity principles to this application. I will return below to express my conclusion in respect of Grounds 2 and 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Youth 
       
      
    45 In the course of his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge found special circumstances by reason of the youth of the applicant and stated that he shortened his non-parole period by four years on this basis. 
     
      
    46 The view expressed by this Court in Hajeid (supra) at [49] is equally applicable to an assessment of this ground in the present case. There, the members of the Court stated that they were not of the view that the offender’s relative youth could allow of a significant moderation in the sentences to be imposed, stating:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… these offences call for sentences that denounce criminal behaviour of this type and that serve to punish this applicant and to deter him and others from engaging in it.” 
        
       
      
    47 I, for the same reason, do not consider that there is any substance in this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    48 In the applicant’s written submissions, it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
         “These offences were committed by a child with no criminal antecedents and with presently good character. They arose out of one incident. In these circumstances, the applicant submits that a sentence of 23 years with a non-parole period of 15 years is manifestly excessive.  
        Hajeid 
         (supra) at [45] is authority for that proposition.” 
        
       
      
    49 In the course of his oral submissions, Mr Game SC submitted that the Court should approach the case on the basis of the factual findings in relation to the sentencing on Ms A and Ms B, but none of the findings by the sentencing judge in relation to overall culpability. This submission raises the matter considered and dealt with in relation to Ground 1 and, for the reasons there stated, the submission should be rejected. 
     
      
    50 In relation to the approach this Court should take in re-sentencing the applicant, reliance was placed upon evidence tendered at the hearing of the application. This included a “Background report” by Greg Robertson, Sex Offender Counsellor, Department of Juvenile Justice dated 20 November 2007. The report was marked as Exhibit 1 in the application. 
     
      
    51 Mr Robertson stated that the applicant was interviewed for approximately 1.5 hours on both 10 and 11 October 2007. During the interviews on those dates, the applicant maintained his denial of being involved in the matters before this Court. Mr Robertson stated in this respect:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… he did not demonstrate any acceptance of responsibility for the offences, and verbalised thoughts that would suggest that he felt as though he is the victim in the current legal matters …” 
        
       
      
    52 The applicant’s denial of responsibility, it was noted, was also recorded in a previous background report completed in August 2002. The applicant claimed at that time he had been wrongly identified by the victim. 
     
      
    53 Exhibit 1 recorded that a few days prior to the hearing of this application for leave to appeal, Mr Robertson was informed that the applicant wished to meet him to talk further about his assessment. This contact occurred on 19 November 2007 and, by reason of Mr Robertson’s other commitments, arrangements were made for him to speak to the applicant by phone on 20 November 2007. He recorded in Exhibit 1 (p.4):- 
     
      
       
        
        “When speaking with [the applicant’s] solicitor … it would appear that over the past 6 weeks since the initial assessment [the applicant] has had time to reflect upon the discussions during the interview with the writer. [The applicant] is now contemplative of change and has become more open and honest about the feelings in which he has been internalising over the past 7 years relating to the offences … 
        
       
       
        
        Since the writer’s initial assessment of [the applicant] on 10.10.07 and 11.10.07, [the applicant’s] motivation to seek treatment and acceptance of responsibility for the offences and feelings of remorse have progressed. He is now demonstrating a general level (sic) remorse and empathy for his victims and has become more reflective and accepting of responsibility for his involvement in the matters before the Court. It appears there has now been a positive shift in [the applicant’s] thinking and feelings associated with his offending behaviours.” 
        
       
      
    54 The reported change in attitude of the applicant comes against almost five years of persistent denial of any responsibility. That attitude had not changed when he was interviewed as recently as 10 and 11 October 2007. There was no reference in the report to the actual words in which the applicant expressed himself to Mr Robertson by phone on 20 November 2007, although parts of his statement on these matters to Mr Watson-Munro on a review conducted on 15 November 2007 are recorded in Exhibit 2 (report dated 20 November 2007, p.2). 
     
      
    55 In the circumstances of the history in this case, plainly caution should be exercised in accepting that the applicant has genuinely and permanently changed his attitude and reversed the strong denials he had consistently made. It appears that it was the recent telephone call from the applicant that led Mr Robertson to express the view that the applicant genuinely wished to move forward and engage in therapeutic treatment. Mr Robertson expressed his view that the applicant could greatly benefit from counselling treatment specific to the nature of the offences. This, he said, would encourage and invite him to take full responsibility for his behaviour and challenge any distorted attitudes and beliefs specific to the offences.  
     
      
    56 In recommending that a longer period of parole and a shorter period of imprisonment be considered, Mr Robertson relied upon the applicant’s recent statements to him as well as the absence of prior convictions and criminal behaviours during adolescence and there being no reported history of drug or alcohol use as well as the history of previous stable employment and family support. 
     
      
    57 The applicant tendered two reports of Tim Watson-Munro, consultant forensic psychologist dated 27 August and 20 November 2007 (Exhibit 2). In his first report, Mr Watson-Munro noted that the applicant maintained his innocence in relation to the convictions but that he had nonetheless developed some insight into the trauma that had been experienced by the victims. He noted that the applicant’s early developmental years were uneventful and that there were no indications of behavioural disturbance or conduct disorder during his formative years. He recorded that the applicant expressed empathy for the victims and general abhorrence at the type of crime and that he was prepared to embark upon a treatment course such as the CUBIT programme as a condition of his eventual release into the community. Mr Watson-Munro concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The broad spectrum of his symptoms is consistent with a diagnosis of an Adjustment Disorder, according to DSM-IV criteria. He considered him well motivated and insightful who, with an appropriate support structure and supervision, would manage to overcome his difficulties.” 
        
       
      
    58 In relation to the issue of recidivism, Mr Watson-Munro stated that he was encouraged by the absence of prior convictions, an absence of behavioural disturbance during his adolescence, his insights into the punishment that has been imposed and his willingness to undertake treatment when offered. 
     
      
    59 In his report dated 20 November 2007, Mr Watson-Munro stated that “it would appear” through conversations with Mr Robertson that the applicant had now come to accept responsibility for his wrongdoing.  
     
      
    60 Mr Watson-Munro noted the applicant’s reported change in attitude and that he found him to be insightful and remorseful which is said to have been reflected by his application for entry into the CUBIT programme. He stated that the applicant required continuing supportive psychotherapy to help reinforce the progress made to date. He considered that he would respond well to involvement in the CUBIT programme when the opportunity eventually arises. 
     
      
    61 Finally, by way of further evidence on this application, Mr Game tendered a letter from a Mr and Mrs Harb dated 27 August 2007. They state in the letter (Exhibit 3) that the applicant worked in their business for just under two years (2 September 2001), that they were satisfied with his work attitude and that the applicant was a hard worker and easily accepted directions. They were aware of the applicant’s involvement in the present case and his current situation and affirmed that they would offer the opportunity of full-time employment to him. 
     
      
    62 The evidence on this application (Exhibits 1 and 2), which report on the applicant having experienced for the first time since (in the period October to November 2007) feelings of remorse and having become more accepting of his responsibility must be treated, as earlier stated, with some care in determining whether his previously assessed risk of re-offending and rehabilitation prospects have, in fact, materially altered. There was no affidavit evidence on the application from the applicant by which this Court can evaluate for itself the basis and steps by which any change has occurred, the genuineness of his statements to Mr Robertson and to Mr Watson-Munro and the likelihood of a real and lasting attitudinal change. Against a long history of denial of responsibility by the applicant, I do not consider that the evidence in Exhibits 1 and 2 can be said to require a conclusion other than the risk of re-offending being other than as previously made, namely, as a medium to high risk. 
     
      
    63 Returning to Grounds 23 and 3 and in relation to Ground 4 and the matters to which reference has been made above, I am of the opinion that the overall sentence and non-parole period should be the same in relation to the application as was imposed by this Court in Hajeid (supra). 
     
      
       
      An issue as to whether the  
      Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 
       is relevant on re-sentencing 
       
      
    64 During the course of the hearing, the Court raised the question as to the possible relevance or impact, if any, of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 in relation to re-sentencing of the applicant. 
     
      
    65 The Act commenced on 3 April 2006. Section 3 of the Act states that the objects of it are to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as:- 
     
      
       
      (a) to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and 
       
       
      (b) to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders. 
       
      
    66 The Act defines a serious sex offence, inter alia, as meaning an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the Crimes Act 1900. Accordingly, the offences under s.61J of which the applicant was convicted fall within the definition of a serious sex offence under the Act. 
     
      
    67 In the Crown’s written submissions dated 27 November 2007, it is stated that an application by the Attorney General under the Act would be preceded by an initial recommendation from the Department of Corrective Services. The Department may do so after having conducted an assessment of both static and dynamic risk factors. 
     
      
    68 The Crown has observed that there is no evidence before the Court as to the practice of the Attorney General in relation to cases that may be subject to an application but that if the process under the Act is triggered, in the first instance by a score of at least 6 on the Static-99 statistical methodology (this being the minimum score to be classified as “high risk”), this fact alone is not sufficient. There would need to be other evidence that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence. The Crown has submitted that, in the present case, the applicant fell below this range into the “medium-high risk category” on the Static-99. On the basis that, if the applicant were to receive the same non-parole period as Hajeid (of 12 years), then the applicant’s non-parole period would expire in another five years (on 17 November 2013). 
     
      
    69 As the Crown correctly observed, there would be an opportunity for the applicant to improve in terms of dynamic indicators which may reduce his risk of re-offending. That, if it occurred, would render an application under the Act even more unlikely. 
     
      
    70 The matters to which reference has been made in relation to the fourth ground above renders it difficult to predict what the likely rehabilitation prospects for the applicant might be. Furthermore, as the Crown has observed, there is no assessment before this Court establishing that the applicant is, at the present time, a high risk sex offender and that the evidence indicates that he is not. 
     
      
    71 The Crown, accordingly, pointed to the evidence that points against the ability to assess the impact any future application under the Act could have and that there is no basis upon which a prediction can be made as either to the likelihood of any application by the Attorney General nor of the chances of success should such an application be made. Rather, the Crown has submitted that, if on the basis of present information, the Court were to attempt a prediction, then that would point to the conclusion that an application under the Act in this case is unlikely. 
     
      
    72 The Crown has also, with respect, correctly observed that any application made at a future point in time under the Act is not relevant in the determination of the appropriate non-parole period. In such a determination, the sentencing court is not concerned with an offender’s prospects of rehabilitation. The court on re-sentencing would be concerned with determining a non-parole period for the purposes of deterrence: Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 362; Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534. 
     
      
    73 The applicant’s further supplementary submissions dated 30 November 2007 are to the same effect in relation to this last-mentioned aspect (see paragraph [14]). 
     
      
    74 The applicant submitted, however, that when setting a non-parole period or a head sentence, a sentencing court may, in some circumstances, have regard to the possibility of actions by the Executive. In this respect, reference was made to Hoare v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 348 (the fact that a prisoner could be accredited by prison authorities with remissions was held to be something that the sentencing court could have regard to under s.302 of the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA). The Court stated that the possibility that a prisoner might ultimately spend less time in prison as a result of Executive decisions, could not result in the imposition of a longer sentence, but the court could still have regard to how the scheme worked. Mr Game also referred to Radenkovic v The Queen (1990) 170 CLR 623 (concerning the issue of when re-determining a sentence following legislative change in the sentencing regime, it was appropriate to have regard to parity with other offences of persons who had been sentenced before the new legislation came into force). 
     
      
    75 Mr Game submitted that the Act could be relevant to a sentencing court setting a sentence in circumstances to which the principle in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987) 164 CLR 465 applies. He submitted, in this respect, that the fact that the Attorney General could apply for a continuing detention order under the Act may effect the sentencing court’s decision. He stated in that respect that the need to protect society is effectively neutralised by the fact that, at the time the offender is due to be released, the prison authorities and the court may assess whether the offender remains dangerous to the extent that it is necessary to continue detention or other supervision (paragraph [17] of the applicant’s further supplementary submissions). 
     
      
    76 Mr Game also submitted that the fact that the Attorney General may cause the Supreme Court to re-visit the question whether an offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence may be relevant to the way in which rehabilitation is taken into account when setting the non-parole period and the head sentence. He submitted that, given that an offender is unlikely to be released until she or he is judged to be likely to commit a further serious sex offence, the sentencing court may begin by taking a guarded but optimistic view of the prospects of rehabilitation in the knowledge that another court will consider the question with the benefit of further evidence. 
     
      
    77 Finally, Mr Game submitted that it was impossible to predict with any certainty whether the Attorney General would make an application under the Act and to determine the outcome of any such application. He observed, however, that there was at least a possibility that the applicant may be kept in custody beyond the expiry of the non-parole period and the head sentence and that that possibility may justify a reduction in the overall non-parole period and head sentence. 
     
      
    78 In the circumstances of the present case, and in particular, having regard to the fact that, on the evidence, it cannot be concluded that an application under the Act is likely, I do not consider that this is a case in which the possible impact of the Act falls for determination. 
     
      
    79 Accordingly, I am of the view that this Court should re-sentence the applicant in accordance with what has is stated in paragraph [83]. 
     
      
       
      Conclusions 
       
      
    80 The Crown has accepted that the applicant must be re-sentenced and conceded that, in accordance with the principles of parity, his sentence should be reduced. The Crown’s position is that the applicant should be re-sentenced on the same basis and in accordance with the judgment of this Court in Hajeid (supra). 
     
      
    81 The fact that the applicant was acquitted of the charges in respect of Ms C does not, as discussed above, carry with it the consequence that the factual sub-stratum was altered in a way that would warrant a re-assessment of the nature and extent of the applicant’s culpability associated with his offending in respect of Ms A and Ms B. The factual findings concerning the events associated with the offences involving Ms A and Ms B made by the sentencing judge were not challenged in this application. Those findings well support the characterisation of the offences as involving a high level of criminality as part of an organised criminal conspiracy. 
     
      
    82 There is no material which requires that the applicant’s risk of re-offending is other than as assessed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    83 I, accordingly, am of the opinion that this Court should re-sentence the applicant upon the basis that there be an aggregate term of the sentences to be imposed of 17 years’ imprisonment with an effective non-parole period of 12 years. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    84 Accordingly, I make the following orders:- 
     
      
       
      (a) Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      (b) Allow the appeal and quash the sentences imposed in the District Court. In lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced to the following terms of imprisonment:-

   JUDGMENT1 The issue raised in this appeal is a difficult one, it raises the question of whether I give a young man who has a deplorable criminal record another opportunity. The effect of the submission made by his solicitor, Mr Edmunds is that his client is at a crossroads in his life and that despite his appalling record he should be given one last opportunity. I propose to accept that submission.2 When Kurt Russell Durante came before the learned Magistrate sitting at the Local Court at Bega on 5 July 2007 he was charged with affray. He pleaded not guilty to that affray but was convicted. Briefly the affray occurred on Saturday 4 November 2006. It was in Eden, during the Whale Festival. There were show rides and a large crowd of people. A fight broke out between two people. Neither of those was Mr Durante. But at one stage Mr Durante joined in the fight. The learned Magistrate found that his contribution to the fight was to inflict one kick. The result of that was that other people became, even more people became involved in the brawl. Mr Durante was arrested about ten days later and charged.3 The crime of affray is a serious one, it is contained in s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900 NSW. It involves a person using or threatening unlawful violence towards another, whose conduct is such as would cause a person of reasonable firmness at the scene to fear for their personal safety. Parliament has attached a maximum sentence of ten years to that offence. It shows how serious Parliament regards that kind of behaviour. I note of course that my jurisdictional limit, because it is being dealt with summarily, is two years. The maximum penalty attached by Parliament indicates how serious the offence is.4 As I said Mr Durante has an appalling record for a young man who is turning twenty-eight this year. Passing over his convictions as a minor, he has committed criminal offences almost every year since becoming an adult. He has committed offences in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005 and this offence in 2006. He has been before the Local Court mostly at Eden. He has had the benefit of bonds, fines and suspended sentences. He has appealed to the District Court in various matters and has had some success. The crimes that he has committed involve matters of violence and include common assault, behaving in an offensive manner, assaulting police and contravening apprehended domestic violence orders as well as maliciously damaging property and traffic offences involving alcohol.5 The affray committed by him on 4 November 2006 was just the last example. It is a more serious crime than some of the others, if not all of the others, that he has committed. To my mind he was fortunate to receive from the Magistrate a sentence as low as a fixed term of two months. I am not critical of the learned Magistrate because his Honour evidently found that Mr Durante’s participation in the affray was limited to one kick so that I can understand his Honour regarding the crime in this case as relatively low in objective seriousness.6 Mr Edmunds called his client to give evidence today. He acknowledged his poor record. He indicated that he had left school at year 9 and that he suffered a significant hearing loss at the age of round eleven or twelve, that has been recently attended to and he wears a hearing aid. 7 The point which I made at the beginning of these remarks about the crossroads arises in this way. Mr Durante has recently secured employment. This is his first real job, he has never had full time paid employment. Exhibit 1 is a letter from Mr Mick Leiter dated 31 January 2008. It verifies that Mr Durante started casual work last week on 5 February 2008. The work was as a concreter with Mr Leiter. Mr Durante tells me that although is now employed casually he anticipates that he may be able to gain full time employment. Mr Durante volunteered to me that this is his first real job and he is happy; he thinks it will keep him out of trouble. His trouble has been contributed to in the past by the fact that there has been no work for him and there is nothing for him to do. I also wonder, although I cannot find, whether his deafness which has recently been treated, may have also contributed to his wayward behaviour; but as I say that is an idle speculation on my part.8 In cross-examination by Mr Stanley for the respondent prosecutor, Mr Durante acknowledged his bad record of violence and offences involving alcohol. He acknowledged that he has not done much about his anger management and has slowed down his drinking. He acknowledged that he has had opportunities in the past. Once again when being cross-examined he said that he was looking forward to getting full time work and it was the first job he had ever had and he really liked it. Asked whether he would be prepared to undergo programs for anger management and alcohol problems treatment he said that he would.9 In light of Mr Durante’s record I would normally have little hesitation in dismissing the appeal and confirming the Magistrate’s sentence of two months full time imprisonment. But Mr Edmunds has put up a submission which involves an alternative. He has submitted that I could increase the sentence, but suspend it to enable Mr Durante to take this opportunity, his first, to engage in regular, full time paid employment which may well be a turning point in his life. The evidence from Mr Durante, which I accept - I was impressed by him as a witness - confirms this. 10 I am prepared to allow him this opportunity. I appreciate that I am taking some risk so far as the community is concerned by allowing Mr Durante his freedom. When he has been given his freedom in the past, on occasions he has abused that and found himself in fights. This puts members of the community at risk. I am conscious of the risk that I am taking in allowing him this opportunity. Nevertheless I have been persuaded by Mr Edmunds and by his client’s evidence that this is an appropriate course. Mr Stanley realistically does not oppose this course. I respectfully agree with his position.11 I administered a short time ago what is conventionally known as a Parker warning to Mr Durante. I indicated to him the choices which I had. I indicated to him that submission was going to be put to me that he should be sentenced to eight months imprisonment but that that should be suspended. I explained to him the risk that that exposed him to, that he could end up in full time imprisonment for up to eight months, that is four times more than the Magistrate imposed upon him, but that on the other hand he could have eight months of freedom and undertake his work. Mr Edmunds took instructions and informed me that his client understood and that he maintained his submission that an eight month suspended sentence would be sought. As I have said I am prepared to accept that submission and I propose to uphold the appeal.12 The formal orders which I make are these. Under s 20(2)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence of the learned Magistrate. Instead of that sentence, I impose a sentence of imprisonment on Mr Durante of eight months and I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of that sentence for the whole of the term and I direct that Mr Durante be released from custody on condition that he enters into a good behaviour bond for the period of eight months.The bond is to contain the following conditions. 
     
      
      1. that Mr Durante, during the term of the bond, will be of good behaviour. 
       
      2. that Mr Durante will appear before the court if called upon to do so at any time during the term of the bond. 
       
      3. that Mr Durante will inform the Registrar of this court of any change of his residential address during the term of the bond. 
       
      4. that Mr Durante subject himself to the supervision of the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service for the duration of the bond and that he accept any reasonable directions or recommendations made by an officer of that Service regarding anger management and alcohol consumption courses. 
      
    Have a seat Mr Durante. I direct that Mr Durante report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Bega on or before next Friday 15 February 2008 at 4pm. Anything else?STANLEY: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: The sentence, I do not specify the commencement date of the sentence anymore do I Mr Stanley, if it is a suspended sentence of eight months. I do not specify a commencement date do I?STANLEY: No it is evident that it commences the day in the event your Honour.HIS HONOUR: The bond is to commence today 8 February 2008. Any other orders or directions?STANLEY: No your Honour.EDMUNDS: No your Honour.13 Mr Durante just stand up. In a sense you have won your appeal, in a sense you have lost your appeal. I have increased the sentence but I have suspended it. You do not have to go to gaol. I have given you a bond, but you have got an eight month sentence hanging over your head. If you breach the bond you will come back before me or before another judge and there is every chance you will go to gaol full time, all right, so it is in your interests to get back with that employment and to carry on with your work which you are enjoying and to stay out of trouble. And I have also made it a condition that you go to Probation and Parole and that you accept their directions so far as any courses for anger management and alcohol that will help you, that plus the work is going to help you and may turn your life around. We will see. You have got to tell this court if you change your address, you have got to stay out of trouble - be of good behaviour - for the next eight months because if you do not you will back here and going to gaol almost certainly. Do you understand that?APPELLANT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Anything else Mr Edmunds or Mr Stanley?EDMUNDS: No thank you your Honour.STANLEY: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you both very much for your assistance. Good luck Mr Durante.APPELLANT: Thank you very much.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is a Crown appeal asserting the manifest inadequacy of sentence imposed by Woods DCJ at Sydney District Court. The respondent had been committed for sentence following her plea of guilty in the Local Court to a charge of importing a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug, namely heroin. The marketable quantity is specified as 2 grams and the commercial quantity is reached at 1.5 kilograms. In the present instance, the gross weight of drug was 141.30 grams with a pure content of 108 grams. The Crown facts estimated a wholesale value of about $49,840 and a street value of between $90,000 and $270,000. The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for four years with a non-parole period of two years.  
     
      
    3 The evidence consisted of a statement of facts, the transcript of interview between the police and the respondent, a pre-sentence report and some oral testimony given by the respondent. The primary conduct out of which the offence arose was not in dispute. 
     
      
    4 On 9 March 2007 the respondent arrived at Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport on a flight which had originated in Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam. At the customs barrier she was approached by officers and consented to undergo an internal search. Australian Federal Police officers took her to St George Hospital where a CT scan revealed the presence of four foreign objects in her lower intestine. She was arrested. Over the following hours she passed these objects and subsequent analysis revealed them to contain white powder which was analysed to constitute the drug abovementioned. 
     
      
    5 The respondent is an Australian citizen of Vietnamese origin, now aged forty one years. She is the mother of two children aged eighteen and eight. At the time of her arrest she had been separated from her husband, with whom the children now reside. She has no prior convictions. She was not in employment and was in receipt of Centrelink benefits. Over the past seven years she has travelled between Australia and Vietnam on ten occasions and was, as his Honour found, well aware that the importation of heroin was unlawful.  
     
      
    6 Her explanation was that she was in considerable debt as a result of gambling losses and agreed to import the contraband for an anticipated fee of about $20,000 in order to meet at least a substantial part of her debt. She claimed that her multiple trips to Vietnam were to assess the prospects of an advance in her relationship with a boyfriend. She told police that she also visited a younger sibling and a brother in Vietnam, although she told the probation officer who prepared the pre-sentence report that her mother had died and after remarriage her father and her six siblings had left to reside in the United States. I do not suggest that anything in this appeal turns on this but it provides an example of the difficulty in assessing a number of matters about which there is imprecision and vagueness.  
     
      
    7 A further example is her claim to have no real ability to identify the persons on whose behalf she couriered the contraband yet she told police that she returned to Australia “early” because she ran out of spending money (Interview questions 165-170) of which change those who were expecting her and were to meet her at the airport in Sydney (Interview questions 156 and 157) would presumably have been unaware. 
     
      
    8 It is the Crown contention that his Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried as a result of both errors of fact and law. The restraints upon this Court when dealing with Crown appeals against sentence are well established and do not require restatement: see for example Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295; Regina v To [2007] NSWCCA 200.  
     
      
    9 The Crown points to two critical findings made by his Honour, first, that the respondent had a “pathological interest in gaming, whether by poker machines or roulette or otherwise” and, second, that she committed the offence in circumstances of duress. 
     
      
    10 The respondent tendered evidence of membership cards showing that she belonged to a number of licensed clubs. In answer to police enquiry she asserted that she had a gambling addiction. The pre-sentence report expressed an opinion that it would appear that that was a contributing factor to the offence.  
     
      
    11 It was, in my view, open to his Honour to find that the respondent suffered from some form of gambling addiction. The appellant challenged the description “pathological” and drew attention to the absence of psychiatric or psychological support for such a diagnosis. It is not necessary to pursue analysis of this detail and I would not determine error in his Honour’s finding that the existence of the respondent’s gambling debts was included in the inspirations for her commission of the crime. Whether this is a matter of mitigation is a different question. I agree with the Crown submission that the observations of Latham J in Le v R [2006] NSWCCA 136 are apposite: 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent that his Honour found that the applicant’s succumbed to gambling and that it was ‘not unlikely that she may have been groomed and pressured into this importation by others who do not share her naivety and compliant personality’, they are unremarkable features of many importation offences. It is commonplace for offenders to seek to explain participation in an importation, other than simply admitting that it was a premeditated act committed for financial gain. Whether that explanation be the offender’s vulnerability arising out of a drug addiction, or a gambling addiction, it generally does not warrant the extension of leniency. The deterrent value of sentences imposed on those who import drugs would be undermined if leniency were extended merely on the basis that an unsophisticated and compliant offender came under the sway of more unscrupulous people.” 
        
       
      
    12 The respondent described some of the circumstances giving rise to her indebtedness in these words in her testimony: 
     
      
       
        
        “When at the table at gambling sometimes I lost and as soon as it was known that I was losing money someone tapped my shoulder and say ‘if you want to borrow some money to keep playing here’s the money for you’.” 
        
       
      
    13 She was asked whether she knew the names of the people who tapped her on the shoulder and replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yes, there (sic) names are all known, but I just not know whether those names was their true names. But I know them as sister Ng (?), sister Hi (?) or some other sisters.” (As the Court Reporting Branch transcript reads). 
        
       
      
    14 The respondent was unable to provide any greater detail of identity in relation to obtaining the drugs in Vietnam. When questioned by police she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This person came along and gave me the stuff and told to, yeah, put them in just like that – and left. I – I never caught the name or anything like that. Yeah.” 
        
       
      
    15 In his remarks on sentence his Honour found that the criminality of the respondent was substantially mitigated “in this case when one puts together the gambling obsession, the trickery involved and the duress, even though the duress does not amount to a full defence.” 
     
      
    16 I am unable to identify to what his Honour was referring as trickery. The respondent had told police that the people who asked her to do this trip said that she should go over there (to Vietnam) and “do this to be able to get money to settle a debt.” In these circumstances there can be no other conclusion open but that the respondent left Australia having been offered the opportunity to earn money to discharge her debt to those from whom she had borrowed money and that she had decided, at the very latest, to import the heroin when she was given the drugs in Vietnam. Although she said she was scared, she did not indicate whether this was a fear of these people, fear of indebtedness or a fear of retribution for doing what she knew was criminal. She told police “yeah, so I thought I’ll just be gamble and just do a trip and see if anything, you know.” 
     
      
    17 On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that the proclaimed reliance upon duress as a matter of mitigation was supported by statements of the respondent to police and that it was not now open to the Crown to assert that the evidence could not support a finding of duress. 
     
      
    18 The questions and answers referred to by counsel in written submissions were the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q135 Okay. With Hai what – what we would like to know is that just before you’ve – you’ve come back to Australia what – what we need to know is how the – the drugs that were found on your person, in your body, okay how did they get in you? 
        
       
       
        
        A Like I said the other day over here ‘cause at the time I – I was so wrong. I – I went to the casino and I – I gamble and I get all this debt. I owed a lot of money. I owe like forty, fifty grand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q136 M. 
        
       
       
        
        A And they said to me that now that you owe us thirty grand you better go and do that, you know, do that thing and – and then you have some money to pay us back, at least half of what you owe. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q152 Okay. So you should go over. So you’ve decided that you’re going to – to go over there and that you’re going to --- 
        
       
       
        
        A I – I – I was so wrong. I – I was scared and I – I got worried about the welfare of my kids and everything. These people are capable of doing what they’re doing. Yeah, so I thought I’ll just be gamble and just do a trip and see if anything, you know. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q162 Okay. Did you know what was – what was inside the bag? 
        
       
       
        
        A I said – I said, ‘I don’t know what to do and you’ve given me this.’ And I was told, ‘if you want to get the money you better take this over there, and these are not a lot.’ I was very scared and I was saying I only owe not a lot of money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q163 Mm. 
        
       
       
        
        A And then the person said, ‘Well it’s up to you whether you want to go through with it or not. They can bring it back, don’t care.’ And then I was thinking, you know, I was worry about my family, my kids and that so, you know. 
        
       
       … 
       
        
        Q176 Now you’ve – you’ve sat down. Was it – were you uncomfortable on that trip or were you – were you – what were you feeling? What sort of emotions were you --- 
        
       
       
        
        A Many things went through my mind really. I was scared. I was frightened. You know, I was thinking about the welfare of my two kids. You know, if anything happened I will leave them behind. You know, stuff like that. 
        
       
       … 
       
        
        Q245 Okay. So how long before you left did you decide to make the trip? 
        
       
       
        
        A When I got over there I did a lot of thinking – a lot of thinking if I make this trip one time, if I could settle all the debt and my kids will – will not be angry with me. And I kept thinking and then in the end I decided that I have to do – I have to make this trip just one and clear all the debt and then will never do it again. Yeah, I was so wrong. I was, yeah, persuaded into doing it, you know, and I have a lot of regret right now. 
        
       
       … 
       
        
        Q262 Okay. How many people do you know who have brought drugs into Australia in this same way? 
        
       
       
        
        A I – I am very scared and, no, I don’t know. – I – I gamble and I do it all on my own, you know.  
        
       
       
        
        Q263 Why are you scared? 
        
       
       
        
        A Because I – I am very worried about the welfare of my two kids and I just see that I have committed an offence in here, you know.” 
        
       
      
    19 As I earlier observed in relation to part of one of those answers, there is no suggestion that any fear that the respondent felt was the result of anything said to her by a creditor or someone acting on the creditor’s behalf. Her answers were consistent with fears centred upon the situation in which she had found herself and this was a result of her agreement to involve herself in what she knew to be punishable criminal activity. That is scarcely a foundation from which a conclusion that she was acting under duress can be drawn.  
     
      
    20 In my view the Crown submission that his Honour’s finding that the respondent’s criminality was substantially mitigated by duress was wrong should be sustained. I add that the respondent pointed to no evidence which could constitute the trickery which his Honour mentioned in this context. 
     
      
    21 It is perceptible that such an error may have infected the assessment of sentence but, in any event, in my view the sentence is so low as to be outside the appropriate pattern of sentencing within which range sentence should be assessed. At the first instance hearing reference was made to three cases which provide indicators confirming the view that the assessment in this case is below range.  
     
      
    22 In R v Chew [2004] NSWCCA 26 the offender arrived at Sydney Airport concealing packages ultimately analysed to contain 71.8 grams of pure heroin. Like the respondent, this offender was taken to St George Hospital for internal search and whilst on route he admitted the internal concealment of contraband, and sought to bargain with authorities in order to be able to leave Australia. He was a courier. He received a sentence of six years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years.  
     
      
    23 In R v Dang [2004] NSWCCA 269 the offender arrived from Vietnam carrying heroin in his shoes. He was a courier who had been promised $5000 for the importation, which was analysed to contain 218.6 grams of pure heroin. He gave authorities some assistance which was evaluated as a discount of 30 percent on sentence. A sentence of six and half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years and four months was not disturbed on appeal.  
     
      
    24 In Le v R (supra) the offender arrived at Sydney Airport internally concealing two packages. She consented to external search but denied carrying any concealed contraband. Although she gave different versions of events to police and to a psychologist, she had contended that she acted as a courier in order to expunge gambling debts. A sentence of seven and half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years was not disturbed.  
     
      
    25 Whilst the effect upon sentencing patterns consequent upon the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act 1914 is recognized, there is nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of the conclusion that, having regard to the cases abovementioned, the imposition of sentence upon the respondent was markedly below an established range.  
     
      
    26 The Crown has contended that errors were made by his Honour in the procedure which he adopted in first applying a discount for the plea of guilty to a notional sentence and then further reducing the sentence for reasons of mitigation and has also challenged his ultimate assessment of a non-parole period which is equivalent to 50 percent of the head sentence. As, in my view, this Court should uphold the Crown appeal and proceed to resentence, it is unnecessary to deal in terms with those submissions.  
     
      
    27 In relation to the firstmentioned, however, a reference can be made to the observations of Spigelman CJ in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at par 13: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is now well established that it is an error of principle to select a specific figure – whether that be a maximum sentence or a standard non parole period of a ‘subliminally derived figure’ (see  
        Markarian v The Queen 
         [2005] 79 ALJR 1048 at [39]) – and to add or subtract matters item by item in some sort of mathematical process. The reason that this approach constitutes legal error is because it impermissibly confines the sentencing discretion.” 
        
       
      
    28 In imposing sentence it is necessary to keep in mind the restraint which is consequent upon what is frequently termed the double jeopardy faced by the respondent to a successful Crown appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    29 As at the present time there is evidence describing the favourable response of the respondent to incarceration and this should be taken as an indication that she has good prospects for rehabilitation. The plea of guilty was offered at the very earliest opportunity and I would re-apply an approximately similar assessment to that of the primary judge for the value of that plea. 
     
      
    30 His Honour’s remarks suggest that he gave some weight to a disapproval of the extent to which gaming facilities are widely available, specifically poker machines. It can be observed that the respondent spoke of roulette and cards, although I appreciate the information from Senior Counsel for the respondent, which I would accept, that in the context “roulette” is a gaming machine activity rather than betting on the fall of metal balls into a slotted wheel. His Honour dilated at some length upon the frequency with which predators persuade those rendered vulnerable by gambling debts to engage in crime such as presently in issue. It suffices to observe that those circumstances do not give rise to a claim for special or enhanced leniency. 
     
      
    31 I propose the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) Crown appeal allowed and sentence imposed in the District Court quashed; 
       
      (b) In lieu thereof, the respondent sentenced to imprisonment for six years commencing on 9 March 2007 with a non-parole period of four years commencing on 9 March 2007 and expiring on 8 March 2011. 
       
      (c) That the legal representatives of the respondent be directed to explain to her the purpose and consequences of the fixing of the non-parole period so as to comply with s 16F of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1914.

      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Shortly after 1.00 pm on 30 May 1995, Mrs Dorothy Davis set out on foot from her home at 9 Undine Street, Lurline Bay to visit a friend. She was never seen again. 
     
      
    2 On 1 November 2002, Bruce Allan Burrell was charged with her murder. He pleaded not guilty. On 17 September 2007, after a jury trial, Mr Burrell was convicted of that murder. It remains for me to pass sentence. Before I do so, I should first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. Where the facts are adverse, they must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Burrell, it is enough that they should be established on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
       
      Background. 
       
      
    3 Mr Burrell was born on 25 January 1953. Before September 1992 he worked as an advertising executive. In 1985 he married Dallas Bromley. Dallas Bromley and her parents were close friends of Mrs Dorothy Davis. Mrs Davis had known Dallas since she was a child and regarded her with special affection. Mrs Davis' late husband had died in December 1984, leaving her with substantial assets. 
     
      
    4 In 1988 Mr Burrell, Dallas and Dallas' parents purchased a 500 hundred acre farm, known as ""Hillydale"", at Bungonia. The farm was adjacent to a national park, in a remote area, three hours drive from Sydney. Access to the farm and the national park required travel upon unsealed roads. 
     
      
    5 After their marriage, Mr Burrell and his wife lived in a unit in Marine Parade, Lurline Bay. In November 1993, Mr Burrell left a note for the owner of a house in the same street, 34 Marine Parade, indicating his interest in purchasing that property. The house was on the corner of Wilson Street and Marine Parade, facing the ocean. Wilson Street was the next street to Undine Street, where Mrs Davis lived, a ten minute walk away. The owner of the house invited Mr Burrell and Dallas around for a discussion. At that stage, however, she was not interested in selling. 
     
      
    6 In January 1994, Dallas was diagnosed with cancer. She began treatment including chemotherapy. The treatment continued until August 1994. A few months before the treatment came to an end, Mr Burrell again wrote to the owner of 34 Marine Parade. The owner was then living in England. In July 1994 agreement was reached for the sale of 34 Marine Parade to Mr Burrell and his wife for $600,000. 
     
      
    7 On Friday 8 July 1994, Mrs Davis wrote a cheque for $500,000 in favour of Mr Burrell. The balance in her account at that time was $114,000. The following Monday the bank manager telephoned Mrs Davis and drew her attention to the shortfall. Mrs Davis explained that the cheque was ""a short term loan to a friend"". She gave instructions to stop the cheque. The bank manager made a diary note of their conversation. 
     
      
    8 On 12 August 1994, Mrs Davis wrote a further cheque in favour of Mr Burrell, this time for $100,000. Mr Burrell deposited that cheque the same day in his account, telling the bank manager that the funds were to be used as a deposit on a property near his home. On 20 August 1994, Mr Burrell, by arrangement, withdrew $90,000 in cash from his account. Again he spoke to the bank manager, suggesting that the money was to be used in connection with the purchase of a house.  
     
      
    9 Mrs Davis spoke to her daughter, Mrs Maree Dawes, about each of these cheques. She related her conversations with Mr Burrell. Mr Burrell had told her that Dallas really wanted the house at 34 Marine Parade. Mrs Davis, generously, was prepared to assist with a loan. The larger cheque, which was later stopped, was written in the context of a suggestion by Mr Burrell that the owners required a larger than usual deposit. Mr Burrell later told Mrs Davis, according to the explanation which she provided her daughter, that a lesser amount would be adequate. It was in that context that the second cheque for $100,000 was written. 
     
      
    10 Mr Burrell said nothing to Dallas concerning these transactions until much later that year. He then gave an entirely different account, which he later repeated to the police. He said that Mrs Davis wished to conceal certain matters from her children. She asked Mr Burrell for his assistance, which he was willing to provide. She would write him a cheque upon the basis that he would repay her in cash shortly after. She ultimately wrote a cheque in his favour for $100,000 and he repaid $90,000 in cash retaining, at her suggestion, $10,000 for his trouble. Plainly, and unsurprising, the jury rejected that account as false. I accept that the money was provided by Mrs Davis to Mr Burrell as a short term loan to assist in the purchase of 34 Marine Parade to benefit Dallas, who had been gravely ill. 
     
      
    11 Meanwhile, in August 1994, contracts were exchanged for the purchase of 34 Marine Parade and a deposit paid. By October the purchase had been completed. However, the $100,000 provided by Mrs Davis to Mr Burrell was not used in that purchase. Instead, a bank loan was raised for the whole of the purchase price. 
     
      
    12 It is clear that the money provided by Mrs Davis to Mr Burrell in July 1994 was spent, or substantially spent, by Mr Burrell in the period before May 1995. He had been unemployed since 1992. He was not in receipt of Social Security benefits. He had no source of income. He was, as he acknowledged in evidence before the coroner, dependant upon his wife, who was employed. Mr Fogarty, an expert accountant, gave evidence at his trial. Mr Fogarty analysed the income and expenditure of the Burrell household before and after July 1994 and demonstrated that, after the loan, Mr Burrell plainly had an unexplained source of cash. 
     
      
    13 Mr Peter Grace, a witness at the trial, gave evidence of a conversation with Mr Burrell after Mrs Davis disappeared on 30 May 1995. He said that Mr Burrell told him that Mrs Davis had loaned him money and had been pressing for its return. Indeed, she had threatened legal action. Mr Burrell, however, was in no position to repay the loan.  
     
      
    14 The evidence of Mr Grace was strongly challenged during the trial by counsel for Mr Burrell. Certainly one may have reservations about certain aspects of Mr Grace's evidence. However, I accept that, in May 1995, Mrs Davis was pressing Mr Burrell for repayment of the loan and that he was unable to repay that loan. The contemporaneous note made by the bank manager in July 1994 in the bank diary corroborated that the advance by Mrs Davis was in the nature of a short term loan to a friend. By the end of May 1995, almost one year had elapsed without repayment. It is unsurprising that Mrs Davis should have been anxious for the return of her money. 
     
      
       
      The murder. 
       
      
    15 Returning, then, to the events of 30 May 1995, Mrs Davis, as mentioned, set out on foot shortly after 1.00 pm from her home at 9 Undine Street, Lurline Bay to visit a friend. Before she left she had a brief conversation with a builder who was attaching an awning to her home. She told the builder that her friend had had cancer and that she was going to walk because it was not far. Mrs Davis clearly expected it would be a short visit. She had left meat defrosting on the kitchen bench. The jury was instructed that it had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the friend she identified by description, and whom she expected to see, was Dallas Burrell. Consistent with the verdict, I make that finding. 
     
      
    16 The invitation to 34 Marine Parade on 30 May 1995 did not come from Dallas Burrell. It came from the offender, Bruce Burrell. He knew that Dallas was at work. No-one else lived at the premises. He was at home alone. I infer that, when he issued the invitation, it was his intention to kill Mrs Davis. Mrs Davis suffered from a medical condition which made walking up hills difficult and painful. Indeed, she notoriously avoided walking up hills, choosing instead to drive her car. The walk from Undine Street to 34 Marine Parade was downhill and Marine Parade itself was flat. However, the return journey, whichever way she went, involved walking up a steep hill. I infer that Mrs Davis was induced by Mr Burrell to walk rather than drive on the promise of a lift home. He thereby avoided having to dispose of her car and risk being seen doing so.  
     
      
    17 The means by which, and the place at which, he murdered Mrs Davis are not known. He was a large man, tall and heavy, then aged 42 years. Mrs Davis was a much smaller woman, then aged 74 years. Removing her from the premises in daylight would not have presented a difficulty. There was an internal staircase which gave access from the house directly to the garage. 
     
      
    18 Between 2.30 and 3.00 pm, Mr Burrell left 34 Marine Parade by a four wheel drive vehicle to make the three hour journey to ""Hillydale"". He would have arrived at 5.30 pm or thereabouts. In late May little daylight would remain after 5.30 pm. He left ""Hillydale"" at about 7.45 pm that evening, returning to Sydney where he spent the night at 34 Marine Parade. The next morning he again drove to ""Hillydale"". The time he set out is uncertain. However he completed the three hour return journey to Sydney by about 2.30 pm. I infer that these two trips, involving 12 hours driving within the space of 24 hours, were concerned with the disposal of Mrs Davis' body. The body has never been found. 
     
      
    19 It was said by the Crown and I accept, that Mr Burrell's motive was purely financial. By murdering Mrs Davis he sought to extinguish the debt of $100,000 which he had not disclosed to his wife and which he was in no position to repay. For a time he was successful in that objective. As I have mentioned, he propagated to the family and the police the false story that the $100,000 was not a loan. Neither the family nor the police was then in a position to contradict his account. 
     
      
    20 The Crown submitted that the offence betrayed significant premeditation and planning, which was an aggravating factor. According to the Crown, it was never Mr Burrell's intention to repay the loan. Further, the absence of forensic evidence at either 34 Marine Parade or in his vehicle demonstrated that he had taken considerable care in the execution of his plan. 
     
      
    21 Counsel for Mr Burrell submitted, however, that the intention not to repay the loan and to kill Mrs Davis may have been formed quite late, presumably when Mrs Davis was pressing for payment. The crime, according to counsel, should be characterised as, to some degree, opportunistic, rather than involving lengthy premeditation. Further, it was argued that no adverse inference is available from the absence of forensic evidence at 34 Marine Parade or within Mr Burrell's vehicle. Although Mr Burrell was interviewed by the police in late June 1995, neither the house nor the vehicle was examined until much later. 
     
      
    22 There is force in both arguments put on behalf of Mr Burrell. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Burrell formed the intention to kill Mrs Davis before she pressed him for the repayment of the loan which, I infer, was in late May 1995. From that moment, however, Mr Burrell gave a great deal of thought to the way in which, by charm and false representation, he would lure Mrs Davis to his home, murder her and then dispose of the body.  
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    23 Let me turn from the offence to the offender. I should make a number of observations. First, there is plainly no remorse. Mr Burrell knew the victim's family well. They were family friends. He was in a position to appreciate the devastation which Mrs Davis' disappearance and murder would have upon that family. Mr Burrell has never accepted responsibility. He has never sought to alleviate the suffering of the family by disclosing the whereabouts of Mrs Davis' body. Indeed, at the trial and no doubt on instructions, the insinuation was made to Mr Lessel Davis, Mrs Davis' son, that his financial predicament at that time may have had some connection with his mother's disappearance. That insinuation was completely false, as Mr Burrell knew. Of course, Mr Burrell was entitled to defend himself as he saw fit (Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656). But, the course he chose was consistent with a complete absence of remorse and the cold blooded nature of his crime. 
     
      
    24 Secondly, there was some delay in the prosecution. Ordinarily that would be a matter which may, to some degree, ameliorate the sentence. However, an examination of the causes for that delay suggest, according to the Crown, that it should be given little weight. Counsel for Mr Burrell, in his helpful submissions on sentence, acknowledged the force of the Crown's submission, which I accept. 
     
      
    25 Thirdly, Mr Burrell has recently turned 55 years. Assuming for the moment a determinate sentence, that sentence inevitably will be substantial and will extend into Mr Burrell's old age. Prison may, because of age, become more burdensome (Holyoak v R (1995) 82 A Crim R 502). There is, however, no principle that an offender should not be sentenced to a sentence otherwise appropriate which may effectively mean he spends the rest of his life, or much of the rest of his life, in gaol (R v Varner (NSW CCA, 24 March 1992, unreported) at 4; Holyoak v R (supra) at 507). In framing the sentence I am about to impose, I have taken into account what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in  R v Folbigg [2005] NSWCCA 23; 152 A Crim R 35, pars [190]-[191]. 
     
      
    26 The final matter is that Mr Burrell has a criminal record. He has a number of relatively minor criminal convictions which, in the context of this offence, are of little relevance. However, on 9 August 2006, he was sentenced for the kidnapping and murder of Mrs Kerry Whelan. In respect of the murder, his Honour Justice Barr imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. On the charge of kidnapping, Mr Burrell was sentenced to 16 years imprisonment commencing on 23 December 2005 and expiring on 22 December 2221. A non parole period of 12 years was fixed, expiring on 22 December 2017. 
     
      
    27 The murder of Mrs Whelan occurred in May 1997, that is almost two years after the disappearance and murder of Mrs Davis. The Director of Public Prosecutions chose to pursue the Whelan indictment before prosecuting in relation to the murder of Mrs Davis. Are the convictions in respect of the Whelan indictment relevant when sentencing Mr Burrell in respect of a similar offence which occurred at an earlier point in time? The issue was considered in R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159, at paras [50]-[61]. In the context of that case, it was said that when sentencing for the earlier offence, the later convictions cannot be regarded as a matter of aggravation. Rather, they deprive the offender of any leniency to which he might otherwise have been entitled, because he had little or no criminal record at the time of the commission of that offence (para [59]). Here, however, there is the additional question of dangerousness and the protection of the community, where the subsequent convictions are, in my view, relevant. 
     
      
       
      A life sentence? 
       
      
    28 It was submitted by the Crown that the level of culpability of Mr Burrell was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence, could only be met through the imposition of a life sentence (s 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). The offence, according to the Crown, was in the worst class of case. My attention was drawn to the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; 164 A Crim R 126, at para [23] where his Honour conveniently set out the principles to be applied when determining whether an offence should be characterised as coming within the worst class of case.  
     
      
    29 Here, broadly, the Crown relied upon two arguments in support of its submission. First, the circumstances surrounding Mrs Davis' murder can be likened to those in the case of Mrs Whelan. The criminality in the present crime was, according to the Crown, similar to that involved in the Whelan murder and therefore should attract the same penalty. Both were offences against women Mr Burrell knew to be wealthy. In both cases the motive was purely financial. Both involved extensive pre-planning and premeditation. Each involved Mr Burrell using his knowledge of the victim and his friendship with her to lure that victim to a meeting, where she would be subdued and murdered. Both offences involved the disposal of the victim's body, such that neither body has ever been found. 
     
      
    30 Secondly, the Crown argued that, even were the view taken that there were material differences between the criminality exhibited by Mr Burrell in the Whelan murder and that in the Davis murder, nonetheless a life sentence was justified upon a broader principle. The murder of Mrs Davis involved a level of culpability similar to that involved in a ""contract killing"". A ""contract killing"", prima facie, falls within the worst class of case. (R v Crofts (NSW SC, 6 December 1996, unreported); R v Smith [2000] NSWCCA 202 at [164] and [166]; R v King (1998) 99 A Crim R 288 at 291 and 292; R v Lewis [2001] NSWCCA 448; R v Baker (NSW CCA, 20 September 1995, unreported); R v Glasby [2000] NSWCCA 83; (2000) 115 A Crim R 465; Burrell v R [2007] NSWCCA 65; R v Burrell [2007] NSWCCA 79.) The criminality was similar because in both the motive was purely financial. There was no emotional element that might ameliorate the killing. As with a contract killing, it was, according to the Crown, a murder in cold blood, made worse by lengthy premeditation and planning (cf Burrell v R [2007] NSWCCA 65, para [329]). 
     
      
    31 However, without diminishing the awful and brutal nature of this crime, which was certainly committed in cold blood for purely financial gain and with no regard for the sanctity of human life, I believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate, rather than a life sentence. Justice Barr, when sentencing Mr Burrell for the Whelan murder, recited the circumstances surrounding the kidnapping and murder of Mrs Whelan (R v Burrell [2006] NSWSC 581). There was, in respect of Mrs Whelan, a persistence and a level of planning far greater than that involved in the murder of Mrs Davis. Further, whilst I accept that Mr Burrell's criminality can be likened to that of a contract killer, the sentences imposed upon such offenders vary widely depending upon the particular facts. The Crown's submission that the Davis murder involved ""lengthy premeditation and planning"" overstates the degree of planning, as I have said, although unquestionably there was planning. 
     
      
    32 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence to serve the interest of punishment, including denunciation and general deterrence. Here, the formulation and execution of a plan to murder a harmless and generous elderly woman in cold blood places this crime at the more serious end of the scale. 
     
      
    33 Mrs Davis was a much loved mother, grandmother and friend. I have before me a number of statements from members of her family, some of which were read in open Court. They are a poignant reminder of the anguish which has attended the disappearance of Mrs Davis and the realisation that she had been murdered. That anguish continues to this day. It will, no doubt, continue into the future. The sympathy of this Court is extended to Mrs Maree Dawes and Mr Lessel Davis and other members of the family. I must, of course, deal with this material in a manner consistent with R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85. 
     
      
    34 It remains for me to pass sentence. In determining that sentence I have taken account of life expectancy tables. I have given consideration to the appropriate commencement date, whether the date of the verdict or the date of sentence. I believe that, in the circumstances, the date of verdict is the appropriate commencement date. I also believe the parole period will be adequate for the supervision Mr Burrell would require were he released from custody. 
     
      
    35 Bruce Allan Burrell, I sentence you to imprisonment for 28 years commencing on 17 September 2007 and ending on 16 September 2035, with a non parole period of 21 years. Accordingly, the earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole in respect of this offence is 17 September 2028.

    JUDGMENT 1. Terrence Connors and Alison Trauntner were living at Unit 10 in a block of units at 243 Targo Road Toongabbie. Their neighbour was Ryan Feeney, he lived at number 12 with his father. The units of both parties, that is the Connors and Trauntner on one hand and Feeney on the other, were on the top floor of the unit block. 2. On 28 November 2006 Connors and his girlfriend were home in their main bedroom watching television as they lay in bed. There was a thumping sound coming from the front door of their apartment. Connors approached the door and saw Ryan Feeney standing there. Ryan Feeney would be probably 6 foot 2 and possibly 90, 95 kilos. He appeared agitated and Connors came to a view that he was intimidating. Connors became scared, it is important to note not a word at this point in time had been said and walked away from the door down a corridor towards the lounge room. 3. Meanwhile Alison Trauntner was coming from the bedroom. She walked past the bathroom and Ryan Feeney turned to her and said “do you wanna fight me Al” or “do you want to fight me aye”, it might be aye. He raised a closed fist and struck her on the right side of her face causing her immediate pain. 4. Connors was sitting on a dining chair while Ryan Feeney was standing by the entrance to the kitchen. Connors was told to get up as Ryan Feeney wanted to fight him. Connors not surprisingly, given the size of his opponent, refused the request to fight. The offender further approached him verbalising an intention to fight. Connors decided the better part of valour was to run, exited the unit blocks and continued some 250 metres away from the unit blocks onto a lane known as Cox Lane. The offender gave chase and caught Connors, grabbed Connors on the left shoulder and pushed him against a wire mesh fence. He punched Connors. Connors crouched lifting his right knee to protect himself from assault. Trauntner by this time had arrived at the location shouting words to the effect “stop Ryan please, please”. 5. [When arrested] he was conveyed to the Merrylands Police Station and read his rights in accordance with the LEPRA guidelines. His state of intoxication was such that police came to the view that he could not be interviewed and was subsequently charged with the matters now before the court.6. On 13 November 2007 an indictment containing five charges was presented against Ryan Feeney. The first being that he had broken and entered a dwelling house and committed a serious indictable offence, therein namely demanding money with intent to steal knowing that the persons were inside the dwelling house. The next was that at the same time and place he assaulted Alison Trauntner. There was a further charge of assaulting Terrence Connors occasioning to him actual bodily harm or in the alternative a count of simple assault against Terrence Connors. And finally a charge of affray. To that indictment the offender pleaded guilty to the two charges of common assault and the Crown accepted those pleas in full satisfaction of the indictment. 7. The first charge is important in as much as it would suggest that there was something left out of the agreed facts which is of importance. 8. A Probation and Parole Service report was prepared in which the offender when asked about the offences said that at the time he had been drinking heavily with his father and numerous emotional issues had arisen. His father asked him to collect money from the victims in order to buy more alcohol which apparently angered him. 9. Today Ryan Feeney is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct as exhibited in the two common assault charges. The courts task is to assess the seriousness of the criminality of this behaviour. That is done by assessing the objective criminality of these two offences by comparing them to offences of a similar kind, to offences of similar kinds in the experience of the court. 10. The court also needs to consider other matters, subjective matters, allowances to be made for the plea of guilty and the ultimate sentencing disposition.The Objective Criminality11. The offences disclose firstly that this offender clearly had entered the premises, with some degree of anger before he even entered. What caused that anger is unclear. The nearest it is explored in the evidence is that his father and he had been discussing “emotional issues”; in that context the father had asked the son to obtain money from the neighbours and that demand or request of the father for some reason or other has angered the son. In those circumstances it would appear that the resentment was not against the neighbours but against the father or against the request. Why it should be that the neighbours needed to pay the price is difficult to understand. In the agreed facts, of course, there is no mention of the demand for money. One has to go to both the indictment allegation and to the Probation and Parole report. What also emerges from the agreed facts is that the assault upon these two innocent parties was gratuitous at least so far as they were concerned. It was impulsive and opportunistic in the sense that he had gone to their door and regrettably they were home. 12. The assault against a woman is always a cowardly act and when one looks at the size of the offender before me and one imagines what strength he could muster and contemplates a woman trying to answer that, the picture does him no credit.13. The assault against Connors is an ongoing assault. It starts from the moment there is the invitation to fight in the kitchen and continues for a substantial period of time ending up with him being impaled against a mesh fence. So an aggravating feature of the offence is the gratuitous violence and the level of violence particularly exhibited towards Connors, that is a violence that needed pursuit in order to be consumed. 14. There are, on the offender’s antecedents, other offences which would appear to indicate problems with alcohol. In November 2004 there is resisting the police officer, assault the police officer and using offensive language. In October 2007 there appears to be another offence of resisting a police officer. As a measure of objective seriousness these assaults are serious although not at the upper level of assault but certainly within the mid range of seriousness for assaults. 15. The assault upon the woman was only of the one blow so far as I can tell and it would seem inferentially the assault against Connors was broken off with the arrival of Alison Trauntner.The Subjective Features16. Ryan Feeney is 24 years of age now and would have been twenty-three at the time of this offending conduct. He was at the relevant time living with his father, a Tongan man who may not have been a good influence on him at least so far as alcohol and the consumption of alcohol is concerned. His parents appear to have separated when he was relatively young. He is the third eldest of his father’s eight children. Each of those children to a different woman. His mother entered a longer term relationship as I understand it with his father’s brother, that is the offender’s uncle. The offender’s uncle or his stepfather, whatever, is described as violent and also is unfaithful. Ryan Feeney has disclosed an instance or at least an episode of sexual assault by an older brother. That matter is still troubling him and in my view may well be contributing to personal issues that this offender needs to confront. Ryan Feeney says that his closest family relationship was with a maternal grandmother who passed away a couple of years ago. There is now another person of significance in his life and that is a girlfriend with whom he lives at Nelsons Bay. The Probation and Parole report says she presents as both supportive and pro-social. 17. It is clear also that the offender’s mother and father are supportive of him because they are here at court today; although it would seem not in the court because of sensitivities experienced by the offender himself. He would prefer that they would remain outside the court. In that sense there is some concern about the nature of support he receives. People can only be effectively supporting if they know what the troubles are that are troubling someone and to keep matters within oneself or to shield those who would support from them often hampers the quality of support that they can give and suggests a difficulty in trusting. That issue may be well placed, on the other hand it may be ultra cautious, I do not know. But it would need to be considered.Employment Education and Skills18. Ryan Feeney obtained his school certificate. He has worked as a labourer in the hospitality industry and to his credit in March 2007 gained a full time employment as a cleaner in the Salamander Bay shopping centre. I have two references from those who know of him in his work environment. Frank Gadaleta is the Operations Manager at the Salamander Bay shopping centre. On 7 February this year he wrote that he had found the offender to “be hard working and a caring individual. He has dealings with the public on a constant basis and has shown that no matter the situation he is always calm and deals with the matter positively”. Well the calmness is not something that we saw on 28 November 2006. Gadaleta says Ryan is one of the few workers that he would consider “sincere in his belief to do the right thing, he is always eager to help and to do new things”.19. His immediate boss Jim Villanueva is his manager or is the manager of The Venue Cleaning and says: 
     
      
      “He is a good worker, courteous and polite, gives a hundred percent effort at work. Work ethic is commendable. Does duties without complaint and does it thoroughly. In the past three months his attitude to work has further improved. I see him to be an honest, hardworking young man and a pleasant fellow”. 
       
      
    20. That was given on 5 February this year.21. Probation and Parole actually spoke with him and their impression of what Mr Villanueva was saying was “his employer gave an excellent verbal reference describing the offender as conscientious, courteous and hardworking”. He confirmed that Mr Feeney works Tuesday to Saturdays and that he would lose employment if he were not available on Saturdays.General Health22. So far as one can tell this offender appears to enjoy good health.Mental Health Issues23. There are so far as one can tell no fixed pathological issues that are contrary to any rehabilitation being achieved. Or put another way it would seem to me that his mental health generally is good. But there do appear to me to be some issues that need to be resolved. His attempted suicide at the age of eighteen that would suggest a significant depression. Depression particularly in young men is not an unusual thing at all. Males aged late teenagers to thirty are the biggest suicide group in Australia particularly up to the age of twenty-five. There is clearly unresolved quite possibly guilt issues and anger issues relating to a sexual assault that had occurred on him when he was aged six some eighteen years ago. 24. Those issues need to be resolved and the sentencing disposition that I will be imposing will require that they be addressed. There are anger management issues. Whether that anger management is related to the example that his stepfather gave to him of violence as a means of sorting out problems, or whether they relate to some brooding resentment lingering at himself or at others as a result of the sexual assaults or both is unknown at this stage because there has not been counselling although he has made what I might call tentative attempts at it. And there is also a pre disposition to heavy drinking especially binge drinking which at the moment is being managed on his account quite successfully but he should not think that because it is being managed it is not there and that would seem to me also to need some attention.25. There is the further issue of what it was that was so enraging to this offender that he needed to take it out on two, as it would seem on the evidence, innocent people, in gratuitous acts of violence. 26. So the mental health issues are there that need attention. But the view I take is that they can be resolved by counselling.27. The offender’s criminal antecedents show that he has been before the court on a number of occasions some for driving offences in 2005, goods in custody and furnish a statement which is false in 2005, the resist police officer in October 2007 and a number of other matters relating to inappropriate resisting of police officers in 2004.28. This is his first occasion in the superior court. In reality these matters could have been dealt with in the Local Court. The indictment that was presented was an indictment presented carrying other charges which needed to be dealt with in this court. So in the scheme of the criminal world these offences are towards the lower range of criminality.29. Although he was I have no doubt committed for trial on the indicted matters it would appear that when he did plead guilty to the common assault that was on 13 November when the fresh indictment or an indictment was presented. As best I can tell it would be at arraignment and presumably by some consent so I regard the plea as relatively early entered.30. His rehabilitation prospects look good particularly if, as I intend to do, he is supervised and addresses the issues which are contributing to or at least may be contributing to his criminal conduct. So far as I am aware he has not spent any time in custody since his arrest. I am satisfied he is truly contrite for the offences that he has committed. I see his rehabilitation prospects more positive than negative.31. Would you stand up Mr Feeney? I convict you of the charge that you on 28 November in Toongabbie in the State of New South Wales did assault Alison Trauntner. I also convict you of the offence that you on 28 November 2006 at Toongabbie did assault Terrence Connors. In respect of each offence you are convicted. In respect of each offence I order you to enter into a bond to be of good behaviour subject to these conditions for a period of eighteen months from today. 32. The conditions of the bond are firstly that you will be of good behaviour, that is you will not commit any offence of a traffic nature or of assault or of any other nature for the eighteen month period. 33. Secondly if you breach that condition and the other conditions of the bond you will come to my court in answer to the breach.34. Thirdly that you will give to the registry downstairs your current address and in the event you should change your address within seven days notify the registry of your new address.35. Fourthly you will accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service for such period as they deem necessary but it will include your accepting counselling, treatment or programs as directed by them in respect of anger management and alcohol abuse. 36. It will be a further condition of the bond that you prove to Probation and Parole Service by at least once a month for a six month period attendance at counselling in relation to the prior sexual assault upon you and such other matters as may be causing you emotional and mental distress. The easiest way to do that proof is once a month to show them a receipt from the counsellor. They may also assist you in finding a good counsellor if you have not already got one. The community mental health team at Nelsons Bay may be able to put you in contact with a counsellor but in any event once a month for six months you have to show that you have been at that counsellor receiving counselling on that issue.37. Do you understand all that?OFFENDER: Yes.HIS HONOUR: Well you tell me back what you have got to do.OFFENDER: I’ve got to report to Probation and Parole and that I have to seek counselling and drug and alcohol.HIS HONOUR: Drug and alcohol?OFFENDER: Yep.HIS HONOUR: Anger management.OFFENDER: Yep.HIS HONOUR: And show them once a month proof of counselling in that other area.OFFENDER: Okay.HIS HONOUR: Do you agree to be bound by those conditions?OFFENDER: Yeah I agree your Honour.HIS HONOUR: This bond will be entered downstairs and you can take it with you.OFFENDER: Okay thank you.HIS HONOUR: You report to Probation and Parole by 4 o’clock on Wednesday of next week, on or by 4 o’clock of Wednesday of next week.OFFENDER: Okay.

    JUDGMENTIndictment 1 On 5 December 2007 the offender was convicted by a jury following a trial on count one of an indictment which was as follows: 
     
      
      On 23 January 2007 at Potts Point in the State of New South Wales he did enter a dwelling house, namely 17-18 of 18 Springfield Avenue, Potts Point with intent to commit a serious indictment offence therein, namely stealing in circumstances of aggravation, namely knowing that a person or persons were there in the place where the offence was committed. 
      
    The maximum penalty for that offence pursuant to s 11(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 is one of fourteen years imprisonment.2 The trial took place at Sydney in the District Court between 3 and 5 December 2007. It appears that the offender was committed for trial in June 2007. The offender did not give evidence at the trial. He gave evidence on the sentencing proceedings.Facts3 In terms of the facts I find that on the basis of the evidence given at the trial and consistently with the jury’s verdict, the following facts to have been established: 4 That four women, being members of the Kitching family, were residents of the Regents Court Hotel, Potts Point at the premises described in the indictment on the evening of 22 to 23 January 2007. 5 At about 5.30am Mrs Firth Kitching was woken. She saw a male person bent over at the doorway of the home in which she had been sleeping with her daughter and granddaughter. Ms Kitching’s mother was in an adjacent room. Ms Kitching recalled that on the previous evening the bathroom window to the unit had been open. Subsequently the window appeared to be off its hinges but there was no evidence to support a break-in in the legal sense. That window was approximately three metres from the ground level and required considerable ability to climb up and enter through the bathroom window. 6 I find that the offender was the person who entered the room. Further, that he would have known or believed that the building was a building utilised for accommodation and that there was a person or persons in that room. 7 I also find the building was a dwelling house within the meaning of the definition contained in s 4 of the Crimes Act in that it was a self-contained secure suite with a bathroom, living area, kitchen and sleeping accommodation.8 Evidence was given at the trial that Ms Kitching saw the person at the entry-way to the door. The Crown submitted to the jury that that was consistent with a person intending to ensure that he had an avenue for quick exit from the room. 9 Given that the offender was found in the room at 5.30am without the lights on, that he did not know any of the occupants, nor was he a guest at the hotel and that he fled immediately when Ms Kitching challenged him, I find that he was present and entered with the intention to steal property from within that room. Identification of the offender10 The evidence as to the identity of the offender was not only that of Ms Kitching, but importantly obtained from the CCTV camera footage at about 5.33am showing the hallway reception area of the hotel as well as outside the hotel. Still photographs taken from those CCTV extracts showed a person with very similar features to those identified by Ms Kitching, in particular, what is commonly known as a rat’s tail emanating from the rear of the person’s head.11 The offender has in any event since admitted his involvement.Evidence at sentencing proceedings12 The offender gave evidence and said that he is currently in Parramatta Gaol. He has been at the Bathurst Correctional Centre for eight months, prior to that at Long Bay. He said he nominated himself to be there to be part of a specific program. 13 His background family history was that he was born in Bourke. He was one of eight children. He had lived with his aunt from about the age of two until he was about thirteen or fourteen. There was substantial alcohol in the house. He left school at about the age of thirteen or fourteen and moved to Dubbo and lived with his sister and then with his cousins. He tried, he said, to get away from the drug and alcohol environment, but in fact he moved into an environment which encouraged that consumption more and more. He said that he started to try heroin at the age of about thirteen or fourteen and it had been a problem for him since that time. 14 The offender said that when he was arrested later on the day of the offence that he was affected by drugs. That was corroborated by the evidence of the police. He said he was then using heroin and ice. He said the reason for his involvement in this particular offence was to get money to buy drugs. He said that in the past he had seen drug and alcohol workers. He found that the program that he had been on before was good. He said he did want to go to a residential program, contrary to the comments contained in the pre-sentence report. He said that he intended to go and live with his mother-in-law at her home at Gosford when he completes his time in gaol. He said his son is there and he is aged three. He wants to look after him. 15 The offender said that he had been involved with the methadone program. He wants to do that further and be involved in courses and rehabilitation treatment programs which will provide a basis for his discarding the drug habits that he has had, on his release from gaol. One of the purposes for this adjournment for a week is to enable his solicitor and the DPP solicitor to make enquiries about what might be available in those circumstances. 16 In cross-examination he admitted that he had not yet made an application for a residential program. He said that he had been on programs before and one was for a three-month program. He was put off that course prior to its completion because of relationship issues. 17 It did seem to me, however, from his evidence that he had little awareness of the requirements for attendance at such programs or any future plans. He had made some limited enquiries about educational and TAFE opportunities available to him. He said that he had not done it in the past because, on one occasion when he needed money, he went back to Redfern and in fact he was robbed. 18 My overall impression of his evidence is that he had made quite limited and indeed vague enquiries about what might be available for him.19 His mother, Ms Mary-Anne Dixon, gave evidence. She had travelled from Mildura, or to be present to give evidence. She had not seen her son, the offender, for some six years. She had contacted the offender’s mother-in-law and was in fact staying with her at the time. She was aware and confirmed that the offender could stay with his mother-in-law and his son, and his partner’s son, on his release. It is a three bedroom house and there is room for him with his son. The offender also confirmed that he wants to maintain a relationship with his son so that his son does not go through what he went through with his own father and the absence of any paternal involvement in his life.20 Ms Dixon confirmed that she thought that the offender had become different while in gaol. He was nicer on the phone and had reiterated his desire to live with his son to get off drugs. She said that she would come down on his release and live with the mother-in-law for a time. However, I am concerned about her awareness of the situation of her son, the offender, and what actual support she might be able to give him or the extent of her involvement in his life given the vagueness of aspects of her evidence. She was unaware of whether the offender’s partner had a drug problem or not. It certainly seems in the presentence report that the offender’s partner is incarcerated at the present time. Ms Dixon was also uncertain as to the nature of that relationship at the present time.Pre-sentence report21 A presentence report was prepared by Nathan Ratzer, of the Bathurst Probation and Parole Service, dated 21 August 2007. It became Exhibit S1. That provided the following details in relation to the offender. Mr Wilson had come into contact with the Probation and Parole Service on numerous occasions in relation to the preparation of past presentence report and further supervised parole orders. The service records indicate that the offender’s response to supervision was usually unacceptable. The offender breached the majority of orders and conditions imposed. The report also notes that Mr Wilson’s most recent period of supervision on parole was revoked on 29 November 2005 due to the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of his order. Social/family factors22 The report confirms that Mr Wilson was born and raised in the Bourke and Dubbo areas. It said that he was adopted by his aunty at the age of two due to issues in his parents’ relationship. It was unclear whether he was legally adopted into his aunt’s care or just passed to her as his parents were said to be unfit to care for him. He said that he had had maintained a positive relationship with both his mother and father. That needs to be looked at in light of the evidence that there appears to have been no contact between them for some six years. He said that his father has passed away while in custody some time ago. 23 The report notes that Mr Wilson has been involved in a relationship of some eleven years standing which resulted in the birth of his young son. As I have indicated earlier, his partner is currently incarcerated awaiting sentencing, and that son resides with the offender’s mother-in-law in Gosford. Education/training/employment24 It appears that Mr Wilson left school at about the age of thirteen. He has not completed any further education or vocational training at that time. He has remained largely unemployed and reliant upon Centrelink benefits. My assessment of his evidence so far is that he has not pursued any further education or vocational training to any significant extent.Factors related to offending25 Mr Wilson’s evidence was that he committed the offence to obtain money for his drug habit.Health/Mental Health issues26 Mr Wilson denied ever having suffered any mental health issues. Service records indicate that he has previously been assessed by a clinical psychologist with no adverse diagnosis being made. Alcohol and drugs27 Unfortunately, the report confirms my own observation of the offender while he gave evidence and that is that Mr Wilson has a long history of drug and alcohol abuse, particularly in relation to heroin. It seems also that he had some significant exposure to ice, which is a dreadful drug with the same sorts of problems addiction as heroin.28 The offender is currently participating in the methadone program at Bathurst in the vicinity of receiving twenty-five milligrams daily. He had expressed a desire to switch to the bupremorphine program but had said in the report that he is disinterested in attending a residential rehabilitation facility. As I said, the offender disputed this lack of interest.Attitude to the offence29 Mr Wilson agreed with the police facts. He did not dispute the findings of the jury and the verdict of the jury. It is said that he had some insight into his offending behaviour, particularly in relation to his alcohol and other drug dependency. However, I am concerned that he, Mr Wilson, has not realised the full gravity of his situation in terms of the likely consequences to him should the situation continue. The statistics are that if he keeps on the way he is he is likely to be dead by the time he is thirty-five. He has expressed the desire to be involved in his son’s upbringing. If he wants to go the way of his father - who apparently died in custody - he has only to keep on doing what he is doing. His son, in turn, will then also be without a father.Prior convictions30 The offender has a significant criminal history with convictions for both violent and non-violent offences. The report notes that he suffers from longstanding illicit drug and alcohol issues, as I have said, and he attributes his offending behaviour to these issues.31 In my view there is a real problem that he has not faced up to the fact that it is his responsibility to get off those drugs. He has, when I go through his report, at least three offences of break and enter, that are substantially similar offences to the present one. He has offences for car stealing, stealing, larceny, assault, aggravated assault and assaulting police officers. Suitability for supervision32 The Probation and Parole Service has indicated that the offender is suitable for a medium to high level of intervention by the Service. That would include strategies to address his alcohol and other drug issues. The Service recommends that in order to effectively supervise him the court order that the conditions include participation in alcohol and other drug assessment, counselling, group programs, residential rehabilitation and urine analysis testing as required. 33 As I have said to the offender: nothing is going to work unless the offender realises that he has got to be, to use the colloquial, ‘fair dinkum’ about getting off drugs. He can say what he likes in his evidence to me, he can tell his mother whatever he likes, but unless he wakes up to it himself and works out the reality of where his life is going, the consequences to him will be very grave indeed, particularly given the substantial involvement he has had with heroin abuse for a long period of time. 34 Notwithstanding that drug usage the offender was obviously able to exercise considerable physical agility to scale the wall to get into the bathroom of the particular apartment block, to remain quietly in the premises, in the room, relatively noiselessly, until he was surprised by Ms Kitching. The CCTV footage of him having left the room and being in the hallway reception area also displayed somebody who was in control of his faculties and in particular was able to move quickly when confronted and to make his escape.Section 21A factorsAggravating factors35 Subject to the further submissions that the solicitors may wish to make on the next occasion, I find the following aggravating factors are present: 36 In terms of the offence being part of a planned or organised criminal activity the facts indicate a substantial degree of planning, of someone being able to scale the wall and enter in a bathroom window in the early hours of the morning. It was consistent of someone who had knowledge of the layout of the apartments and the opportunity to make a quick escape. Remorse and contrition37 In terms of remorse and contrition, I do not see any realistic nor genuine evidence of remorse other than as lately expressed in the light of these sentencing proceedings. The offender now admits to the offences when he was interviewed by the Probation and Parole Service and in court despite him having taken the matter to trial - as was his entitlement. However he has lost the benefit of any discount that he otherwise might have had. I do not think that it is a matter where I can take into account any expression of remorse at this stage. Mitigating factors38 In terms of mitigating factors, as I have said it was fortunate both for him and for other people who were in the room that there was no violence. 39 His prior record is not one which gives me any confidence that he will be successful in pursuing any rehabilitation.40 It does seem to me, as I have said, that there has been a significant criminal history of both violent and non-violent offences and, in accordance with the High Court decision of Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465, I do not think that the offender is entitled to any leniency given the circumstances and the extent and history of those offences.Fernando factors41 The offender is of aboriginal descent and origin. He was brought up in the outlying communities around the Bourke and Dubbo areas. He has clearly come from a family and circumstances of disadvantage. He has had very limited educational opportunities and has not pursued those any further. In fact, it was probably unrealistic to expect that he would do so given the cycle of deprivation which had occurred. Clearly alcohol and drug abuse has been a problem for him and those associated with him, his extended family, for some time. 42 The factors to be taken into account by a court sentencing an aboriginal offender were described by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 63 and later by Spigelman CJ in Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at paras 64-70. However, as those cases say, special leniency is not to be extended to aborigines in all cases or classes of cases. Later authorities have made it clear that where persons of aboriginal descent come into the city community they are nevertheless entitled to have those matters taken into account where they are relevant and applicable. That is particularly the case where offenders come from, as I find here to be the case here, a particularly disadvantaged background and where there are questions of alcohol and drug dependency, as is clearly also the case here. 43 I do take those factors into account to the benefit in imposing a sentence which is more lenient than would otherwise be the case.Finding as to criminality44 In terms of my findings as to criminality I take into account that there was no violence. The offender immediately left when challenged. The motivation and reasons he had were clearly one of obtaining money to feed his drug habit. I find that the range of criminality involved was of low range. Authorities45 I have take into account the following authorities, citations of which will be set out in the final version of these reasons, that is R v Silva [2002] NSWCCA 332. I think that that case involves substantially higher criminality than is the case here. That case seemed to have the hallmarks of a home invasion of the home of an elderly man with associated demands. That does not seem to be on all fours with this case. 46 I have also reviewed the decision of the R v Labrooy [2004] NSWCCA 371. Again that sentence involved facts and matters which are more serious than the case at hand - particularly given that the injuries suffered by that victim was substantial. But again the subjective features of this offender are different. JIRS statistics47 The Crown, with the consent of the defence solicitor, tendered up Judicial Commissions statistics extracted from the relevant fields pertinent to this offender, namely pleas of not guilty with offenders with some prior history. However, as has been submitted, they were only twenty cases in the search group and the usual caution must be employed, namely, that the facts of those particular offences and the circumstances of those offenders involved are not known. Nevertheless, the statistics and the authorities referred to in those cases and considered against the background of the facts of this case, as I have outlined them, subject to submissions and the circumstances of this offender, subject to the additional matters to be raised, would suggest that the penalties that I am proposing are within the range of the reasonable exercise of my discretion. Consideration48 This offence involved the entry of premises which were clearly premises for the accommodation of individuals in the early hours of the morning. What was involved was scaling a building to a considerable height requiring agility to get entry into the bathroom. There was no disturbance of the victims, nor physical violence, nor theft. Nevertheless, offences of this nature must be marked by a penalty which meets the requirements of general deterrence as well specific deterrence to this particular offender. 49 Given the submissions made, I think it is fair to say that the factors specified in the guideline judgments of R v Henry and Ponfield are not strictly analogous in the facts of this case. This is not a situation of an armed robbery and there are other distinguishing features. Nevertheless, I think there are some matters set out in those authorities which have been referred to, in my view appropriately, by the solicitors which warrant consideration. However, the guideline matters, particularly in Henry, suggest a range of penalties for what are not analogous situations.Suitability for drug rehabilitation program50 The Probation and Parole Service has arranged for the Drug and Alcohol Unit to assess the offender for his suitability to participate in a residential drug rehabilitation program. I was informed that Mr Lucey of that service has said that he would not be referring the offender for a residential program. There are apparently no places available. Moreover, the fact that the offender is on the methadone program would preclude him from that program.Special circumstances51 Urged on behalf of the offender in terms of special circumstances are that I would find special circumstances. In essence those are his age, the family support said to be available for him, the Fernando aboriginal factors and the possibility of rehabilitation. 52 I see little evidence which would support a finding that the offender would benefit from a substantial longer period. I do think that there are factors warranting a finding of special circumstances. At this stage, it would be my view that the relative adjustment would be one of two-thirds of the normal ratio rather than three-quarters. Some of those matters are set out in the decision of Vu [2006] NSWCCA 188 at para 124: 
     
      
      In  
      Regina v Carter  
      [2003] NSWCCA 243, Dunford, J. (with whom Ipp, JA. and Greg James, J. agreed) stated, at [20], that offenders cannot expect to have the non-parole period reduced to facilitate their rehabilitation unless there are significant positive signs which show that, if allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and not a mere possibility. 
      
    Sentencing options53 In terms of sentencing options, the offender has been assessed as unsuitable for a Community Service Order and ineligible for a Periodic Detention Order. In my view, neither of those sentencing options are appropriate. 54 I do not think that a suspended sentence is appropriate in these circumstances.Commencement date55 The offender has been in custody solely referable to these offences since 23 January 2007. There was an intervening period when he was incarcerated or subject to incarceration for another matter. He was released on 26 April 2007 and then again served a further period from 12 May 2007. It seems that he has been in gaol solely referable to these offences for a period of a little under eleven months. Rounding it up for the benefit of the offender it is, in my view, appropriate that whatever sentence is imposed will be backdated to commence on 1 March 2007.Conclusion56 In my view, the circumstances of this offence and of the offender, taking into account the Fernando factors should warrant the imposition of a head sentence of the order of 2 years imprisonment. My finding of special circumstances is that the statutory ratio should be reduced to one of two thirds by which the non-parole period bears to the head sentence. That finding of special circumstances is based on the offender’s age, Fernando factors listed, plus the fact that there are some limited prospects of rehabilitation provided he remains with or in contact of people whom he respects who will provide him and his child some accommodation and related stability. On that basis the non-parole period will be one of 16 months imprisonment. 57 I take into account the fact that the offender has been incarcerated effectively for about 11 months solely attributable to this offence which would mean that the sentence should be backdated to 1 March 2007. Accordingly the non-parole period will conclude on 30June 2008.SentenceThe offender is formally convicted.The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 months imprisonment to date from 1 March 2007, and to expire on 30 June 2008. The balance of the term will be one of 8 months which will expire on 28 February 2009.

   SENTENCE1. Jonathon Michelin has pleaded guilty to a serious charge. The charge is supplying a prohibited drug. The drug is methylamphetamine. That is an offence against the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The offence occurred on 31 October 2006. In exhibit A is a document of agreed facts and I make findings about the offence in accordance with, amongst other things, those agreed facts. 2. Mr Michelin on 31 October 2006 travelled from Eden to Batemans Bay. He went with a man named Billy Thurston in Mr Mr Thurston’s car. When they got to Batemans Bay they parked their car but, presumably unknown to them, were being observed by police. Another car arrived. Mr Michelin got out of the car that he was in and went and crouched down next to the passenger door of the other car. A short time later he walked back to the car that he was in. Police at that stage stopped both cars. The cars and their occupants were searched. Mr Michelin was found to have in his possession a small amount of cannabis, just over a gram, and what police describe as a small round object that was tightly wrapped in electric tape, both items were in his underpants. It turned out that the small round object comprised 13.35 grams of methylamphetamine. Mr Michelin told police that he had gone to Batemans Bay to buy the drugs and had paid $1,600 for it. It is estimated that the street value is some $7,000. 3. It is convenient at this stage to make reference to Mr Michelin’s criminal record. It notes that he was born on 11 July 1979 so that he is now twenty-eight. Just before he turned eighteen he was convicted of possessing a prohibited drug but he remained conviction free from that conviction, which was in 1996, until 27 September 2005 when he was convicted in the Bega Local Court of again possessing a prohibited drug. He was fined for that offence and for a similar offence the following year, he received a community service order. At the same time he was convicted of a driving offence. For the driving offence he was given a suspended sentence. The suspended sentence was for twelve months and dated from 25 January 2006. He was convicted of another driving offence but the relevant observation to make is that when he committed the offence that I am sentencing him for, on 31 October 2006, he was on conditional liberty in the community. He was in fact serving a suspended sentence, the one that had been imposed upon him on 25 January 2006. 4. That brings me to the first matter that I am dealing with today, namely the call up for the breach of that suspended sentence. It was not originally before me but has been brought to me so that I am now seized of the matter. Before dealing with that I make this observation. As Mr McCallum who appears for Mr Michelin observes in his very helpful written submissions, the Court of Appeal has indicated that where a court is dealing with a fresh offence, which also comprises a breach, it is “of crucial importance that the breach proceedings be resolved before the sentence is imposed for the offence”: see DPP (NSW) v Cooke (2007) 168 ACrimR 397 at 388 [28]. I refer to that because these proceedings developed in a different way. Mr Michelin was committed for sentence to these sittings of the District Court and that was the matter that I was seized of. That matter commenced and I heard evidence and submissions. It became apparent during the conduct of those proceedings, that is the sentence proceedings, that it would be convenient and appropriate that I should also deal with the breach of bond proceedings resulting from the offence for which I am sentencing Mr Michelin. Accordingly arrangements were made to, as I have said, bring the papers to me so that I would be seized of that. It is for that reason that, in this case, the proceedings in respect of the sentence were embarked upon before the proceedings in respect of the breach of the bond. However, in these joint reasons, joint in the sense of dealing both with a breach of the bond and in the sentence, I deal first and now with the breach of bond. 5. As Mr McCallum points out the relevant statutory provision is s 98(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. In summary it provides that I must revoke the bond imposed in respect of a suspended sentence, which is what happened here, unless I am satisfied that the offender’s failure to comply with the bond was trivial, or that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply. Realistically Mr McCallum makes the submission, with which I respectfully agree, that Mr Michelin’s failure to comply with the terms of the bond cannot be regarded as trivial. That follows from the fact that he committed an offence carrying a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment. However, Mr McCallum submits that there are good reasons for excusing his failure to comply with the conditions of the bond. Once again he refers me to Howie J’s judgment in DPP v Cooke. In that case Howie J, with whom Sully J and Price J agreed, was speaking on behalf of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. As his Honour said at [15] of that judgment, the principal consideration raised by s 98(3) is the conduct giving rise to the failure and whether that can be excused. It might be excused, Howie J surmised, because of extenuating circumstances leading to the offending behaviour: see [16]. His Honour went on to consider the question of whether a court can take into account the impact of the revocation of a good behaviour bond. Taking into account the account the impact of the revocation of a good behaviour bond does not appear to sit comfortably with the provisions of the statute. His Honour said that, “assuming that a court could take into account the impact of the revocation of a good behaviour bond, it would be a rare case indeed in which it would be appropriate to do so in this State”.6. Mr McCallum’s submission is that those remarks were made in the context of the impact of the revocation of a bond being ameliorated in this State by a sentence of either periodic detention or home detention and also by a recent legislative change providing that a non-parole period is fixed at the date of the revocation of the bond and not when the sentence was passed and suspended. Mr McCallum observes that his client has been assessed as unsuitable for periodic detention because of the distance he lives from the detention centre. This is not an unusual feature of sentencing proceedings in regional areas. Home detention also is not available in the area where Mr Michelin lives. The suspended sentence imposed on 25 January 2006 on Mr Michelin predated the legislative changes to which Howie J referred. As a result, argues Mr McCallum, the impact of the revocation of the bond cannot be ameliorated because of the availability of periodic detention, home detention or a non-parole period fixed by the original sentencing judicial officer. Accordingly Mr McCallum submits that this is one of the rare cases in which the impact of the revocation of the bond should be taken into account. Not to do so, he says, would effectively preclude any consideration of this offender’s strong subjective features at the time of the revocation proceedings because, as he said, the only role that the offender’s subjective features have to play, at the time of the revocation proceedings is in what order is made after the revocation when determining whether the consequential sentence is to be served by way of full-time custody or an available alternative.7. Mr Stanley who appears for the prosecutor did not take exception to Mr McCallum’s written submissions. I propose to accept that submission. I therefore do take into account Mr Michelin’s subjective circumstances in deciding whether or not to revoke the bond and in doing so I have determined not to revoke the bond. Those subjective circumstances will become apparent when I shortly turn to consider the sentence proceedings. I regard this as a case where sending Mr Michelin back to full-time imprisonment would reverse a process of rehabilitation which has been going on for some time and with some success. Accordingly, in respect of the call up proceedings, I make the following order. Under s 98(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  I decide to take no action with respect to the failure to comply with the conditions of the good behaviour bond.8. I turn now to the sentence proceedings. I have already referred to the objective facts of what happened with this offence and to Mr Michelin’s criminal record. I should have added, as a formality, that when I come to sentence Mr Michelin he has asked me, pursuant to s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, to take into account a charge of possessing cannabis which occurred on the same day represented by the 1.1 grams of cannabis in his possession. I record now that when I come to sentence him I do take into account that offence and I have signed exhibit B, which is also signed by Mr Michelin, accordingly. 9. Exhibit 1 was tendered by Mr McCallum on his client’s behalf. It comprises a number of references indicating that his client is regarded as courteous and good mannered, reliable and a hard worker. One of the referees realistically observes that Mr Michelin might be “foolish and easily lead rather than of criminal intent”. That referee, Alan Fraser JP, nevertheless had “no hesitation in recommending [Mr Michelin] to the court and I am sure that his parents would exercise all of their parental control to guide [Mr Michelin] in the future”. 10. There are a series of reports of reports from Kevin Wallis, a psychologist, who has seen Mr Michelin over the years. One of them was obviously prepared for the proceedings in January 2006. There is a more recent one dated 21 January 2008. Before turning to recording what Mr Wallis expresses his professional opinion about, I note as part of his history taken that he records Mr Michelin saying, and I am quoting Mr Wallis, “He and his co-offender intended to weigh the amphetamine and apportion each a share of the drug. He was asked, ‘Why did you buy so much?’, he replied, ‘Because I do not have a licence’”. I refer to that because it indicates that Mr Michelin had the amphetamine in his possession for supply. That evidence is in a sense not necessary because the amount which he had in his possession was sufficient under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act for it to amount to a deemed supply. Nevertheless that admission is relevant because it demonstrates that there was an intended actual supply but it also demonstrates the limited circumstances of that intended actual supply. 11. Returning to the professional opinion expressed by Mr Wallis in his latest report, it notes a history that Mr Michelin has stopped using drugs. Mr Wallis had earlier thought that Mr Michelin might be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder but in this report expressed the view that rather he seems, “aimless and disorganised, perhaps more from chronic drug use than a psychological condition”. He reported to Mr Wallis that he has not taken drugs since he started seeing Mr Wallis. He agreed to undertake drug tests. Part of exhibit 1 comprises results of urine analysis confirming that he had in November 2007 and January 2008 no prohibited substances in his urine. Importantly Mr Wallis expressed the conclusion that Mr Michelin’s “alertness, mood and cognitive functioning has improved since being engaged in ongoing counselling and having his drug use monitored”. 12. In addition I have two pre-sentence reports. The first one is dated 13 July 2007. It notes that Mr Michelin was not responsive to correspondence. It noted a somewhat lax attitude to adhering to community service orders in the past and a lack of motivation in attending work. It considered him not suitable for a further supervision order. That pre-sentence report from which I have just quoted was part of exhibit A. A more recent pre-sentence report became part of exhibit 1 and is dated 25 January 2008. It notes the failure to work was mostly caused by his drug dependency which brought on unreliability. That is consistent with the opinion expressed by Mr Wallis. He admitted a strong dependence on a daily use of amphetamines. That dependency brought about, said the probation officer, considerable financial hardship and employment problems and appeared to be the principal reason for failure to satisfactorily perform community service in the past. It notes Mr Michelin’s claim to have abstained from amphetamines since his arrest. It noted enquiries indicating that the three urine samples had been negative. It noted his recent psychological report which the author noted, “appears to have been beneficial to Mr Michelin, especially in regard to an improvement in both his mood and cognitive functioning”. It also noted that Mr Michelin appears reasonably well motivated to continue to abstain from illicit drug use. This more recent report reviewed its assessment of his suitability for supervision and regarded him as suitable for a medium to low level of intervention by the Probation and Parole Service, including strategies to address the need for ongoing counselling and regular drug screening. It regarded him as unsuitable, however, for a community service order because of his previous breaches and unsuitable for periodic detention because of the distance problem to which I have referred already.13. Finally Mr McCallum called a witness, Mr Robert Michelin, Mr Michelin’s father. He referred to a serious bike accident which the offender, Mr Michelin, had when he was aged thirteen. It produced problems to do with memory, organisation and cognitive functions in his son. It rendered him impulsive. Before then he was good at sport. Evidently the injury was such that he spent two weeks in intensive care in hospital and then a further two weeks before he was brought home. He had some time in a wheelchair. It affected his lifestyle and his friends. He was not able to participate in the sport that he used to enjoy. He has evidently had no counselling or significant counselling over the years. 14. He left school in year 10 and worked in a cannery for three years until it closed. He then became employed in Mr Robert Michelin’s family earthmoving business. Mr Jonathon Michelin got all his trade tickets and became a very good worker. His father described him as an excellent machinery operator and one of the best on the backhoe. He has a good relationship with his son. He confirmed that Mr Jonathon Michelin is the father of a nine year old son and more recently the father of a baby son. He has a good relationship with the mother of the first son, who is different to the mother of the second son, and sees his first son much more. Mr Robert Michelin explained that his son had problems with the circumstances that arose in 2005 when the mother of his first son moved away, taking his eldest son with her. It had a very hard impact on Mr Jonathon Michelin. His work started to drop back and he lost his driver’s licence. Mr Michelin senior suspected that his son was using drugs. His brothers and sister were not impressed by the fact that he was arrested and charged. Now they are behind him and support him. His health has improved over the last twelve months. He is now re-employed in the business and he is a good worker. His emotional state is a lot better. He talks a lot more and he has a regular and meaningful contact with his elder son. His present partner, Carly, Mr Michelin described as really good for Jonathon Michelin. Their son, Dylan, is now one. Mr Michelin senior wants Mr Jonathon Michelin to settle down and to buy a house which Mr Michelin senior would help him with. He is doing very well with his regular counselling which is being provided by the psychologist Mr Wallis. Mr Michelin senior appreciates the seriousness of the offence which his son has committed. He said that if his son went back to full-time gaol the improvements of the last twelve months or so would be lost. His son would go backwards. 15. I turn now to the submission which were made. I was assisted by submissions by Mr McCallum and from Ms Walsh who then appeared for the prosecutor. An initial issue arose as to whether I was bound by that line of authority in the Court of Criminal Appeal commencing with Regina v Clark (unreported, NSWCCA 15 March 1990). Those authorities have been discussed in the submissions and I do not need to refer to them because of the fact that they are recorded in the submissions. It was acknowledged by Ms Walshe, correctly in my opinion, that there was involved in this case no trafficking to a substantial degree. I also find that the amount involved was relatively small. I also find in respect of the deemed supply, that although there was evidence of an intended actual supply there was no actual supply. I also find that the intended supply was to Mr Michelin’s accomplice and that there was no intended dissemination of the drug into the wider community. These factors in my opinion take this case out of the constraints of the authorities regarding the necessity for full-time imprisonment for drug supply cases. They make available to me non-custodial options. 16. I note that he has a record or previous convictions and I also note he committed this offence while he was on a suspended sentence. There was a limited but not sophisticated degree of planning. In this respect I agree with Mr McCallum’s submissions, these three factors are aggravating features of the offence. On the other hand there is good reason to regard Mr Michelin’s prospects for rehabilitation as being good. In addition he has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. His behaviour, although not excused by his drug taking, was impulsive as a result of his drug addiction and perhaps of his head injury. He is addressing both his drug addiction and the consequences of his head injury. To my mind, for me to send him to gaol full-time at this stage would reverse the good work which he has undertaken and also reverse the course which he has undertaken in rehabilitating himself. I note that neither periodic detention nor a community service order is available. 17. Because of the relatively low objective seriousness of this offence I regard an appropriate penalty in this case as one of eighteen months imprisonment. That is the penalty which I propose to impose and I propose to suspend the execution of that sentence and to direct Mr Michelin to be supervised on a bond. Accordingly, Mr Michelin if you would stand up, I make the following orders in sentencing Mr Michelin.18. I sentence you to imprisonment for eighteen months but I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the period of eighteen months and I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of eighteen months. That good behaviour bond will be subject to the following conditions: (1) you must be of good behaviour during the term of the bond; (2) you will appear before the court if called upon to do so at any time; (3) you will notify the registrar of this court of any change of your residential address; (4) you are to subject yourself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and comply with any reasonable directions and recommendations which they make regarding psychological counselling or rehabilitation for drug addiction.  Are there any other orders I need to make Mr McCallum?MCCALLUM: In relation to the bond, your Honour, I don’t believe there is. There is one matter on a s 166 certificate.19. I note that there is a matter on a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and I dismiss that matter.STANLEY: Actually I think there is two matters, one’s related--HIS HONOUR: And the other’s a backup.STANLEY: Yes, it can be just marked as being dealt with on the form 1.HIS HONOUR: Which one?STANLEY: The related matter which is the possess matter.HIS HONOUR: So I dismiss the backup--STANLEY: Yes.HIS HONOUR: --and the related one was being dealt with on the form 1.STANLEY: Form 1.20. Pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 I dismiss the backup offence described in paragraph A of exhibit C and I note that the related offence described in paragraph B of exhibit C has already been taken into account by me in the form 1 which was exhibit B.  Mr Stanley any other orders I need to make?STANLEY: Just the destruction of the drugs, your Honour, if you can just order their destruction if they haven’t already been done so?21. I order that the drugs the subject of these charges be destroyed if that has not already occurred and I direct Mr Michelin, for the purposes of undertaking his bond obligations, to report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Bega on or before next Friday 15 February 2008 at 4pm.  Are there any other orders I need to make?MCCALLUM: Perhaps not an order as such, your Honour, but just for the sake of abundant caution upon my reading of the Local Court papers that were obtained, I must say I had some difficulty trying to reconcile the sentences that were imposed on him 25 January 2006.HIS HONOUR: So did I, yes.MCCALLUM: With his record. But, your Honour, it appears that there may have been two offences imposed on him on that day for which he received suspended sentences. I could only find one bond in the papers but could your Honour note for the sake of abundant caution that you’re not taking any action on the breach of the bonds in relation to each matter for which he was given suspended sentence on 25 January.HIS HONOUR: Mr Stanley?STANLEY: Yes that’s probably appropriate your Honour.22. Returning to the proceedings for breach of bond my order is intended to relate to a breach of any bond which was imposed pursuant to any suspended sentence imposed on Mr Michelin on 25 January 2006.  Does that deal that? Okay.23. Now, Mr Michelin, the law requires me to explain to you what has just happened. You were on a bond when you had these drugs and you were at large and you still committed another crime which is not a good thing. Normally people go to gaol for that and you should go to gaol, but I have heard what Mr McCallum has said and I have decided not to send you to gaol for that previous offence. As to this offence, the one where you had the amphetamines in the car with Thurston, I have sentenced you to eighteen months gaol but I have suspended the sentence for eighteen months. So you will not go to gaol but you have got to behave yourself in those eighteen months, you have got to let the court know if you change your address and you have got to go to Probation and Parole in the next week and be supervised by them. They are going to help you with your rehabilitation which you have been undergoing for the last twelve months, and the bond says that you have got to co-operate with them, especially so far as any drug courses are concerned or psychological counselling. You can be called up at any time by the court to come and answer your bond. Do you understand what I have said?OFFENDER: Yes.24. If you breach the bond, this bond which I have given you, and the suspended sentence, you are almost certain to go to gaol, almost certain because this will be the second time. So you should not have any doubts about that, you have really been given a third chance, do you understand?OFFENDER: Yeah.25. Okay, have a seat. Now, Mr Michelin you have obviously got very good family support. I have heard from your dad. You have a lot going for you, so stick to what you have been doing, okay, and good luck.

    3 BARR J: The appellant, John Walsh Ngati, has appealed against a conviction entered in the District Court and has sought leave to appeal against the resulting sentence. The appellant was charged that on 15 June 2005 at Airds, while in the company of another person, he broke and entered a certain dwelling house and committed therein a serious indictable offence, namely the assault of Barbara Keeley, occasioning her actual bodily harm.  
     
      
       
      The conviction appeal 
       
      
    4 Ms Keeley and her children, who included teenagers whom I shall call simply J and R, lived in a house at Airds. Nearby lived the Ngati family, who comprised or included the appellant, his wife, a son whom I shall call H and daughters whom I shall call simply P and T. On the day of the events giving rise to the charge, Ms Keeley had a conversation with one of the young persons who lived in the district and he spoke to her in an insulting way. Ms Keeley went to the young person’s mother and spoke to her about it, and she reprimanded him. He happened to be a friend of H, the son of the appellant. Not long afterwards the appellant, his wife, H and P walked down the road towards Ms Keeley’s house, calling her out. Ms Keeley was afraid, ran into the house and locked the front door and the security door. Members of the Ngati family stepped up onto the veranda and began banging on the window. They smashed the window. H enlarged the break by kicking out the glass and entered the house through the resulting breach. Other members of the Ngati family entered the house, probably after the front door was opened from the inside, and set upon Ms Keeley. She sustained bodily injury. There was no issue at trial whether Mrs Ngati or either H or P had assaulted Ms Keeley. They had all previously admitted to doing so, Mrs Ngati in the District Court and the two children in the Children’s Court. There was no evidence that the appellant had landed any of the blows that injured Ms Keeley. The Crown case against him was that he was present, encouraging or assisting or standing by ready to assist those members of his family who assaulted Ms Keeley. The resolution of that question depended on the answer to the question whether the appellant entered the house. The jury were instructed that if they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did enter the house, they could find him guilty of the charge.  
     
      
    5 It is convenient to deal first with the third ground of appeal, namely that the verdict was unreasonable or incapable of being supported by the evidence. The test to be applied in determining whether the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable is that set out in the joint judgment of Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493 -  
     
      
       
        
        Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary, the court must pay full regard to those considerations. 
         
        (Footnotes omitted)  
        
       
      
    6 Ms Keeley said in evidence that she saw the appellant, his wife, P and H in the middle of the road walking towards her house. They were all yelling, telling her to get over to them. She said to them that her speaking to the youth’s mother had nothing to do with them. She was in the driveway of the house and had to get quickly inside the house. She was about seven metres from her front door when they were about the same distance from her front gate. She hurried to her front door because they were still walking and yelling and swearing at her. She went inside and locked the latch on the screen door and closed the door behind it. She could see through the vertical blinds and the lace curtain at the front window. She saw the four of them on the veranda, still yelling to her to get outside, to come out, calling her a slut and a mole. She was afraid to go outside. They started banging on the windows. She stood near the front door, guarding the door. The window broke. The hand of H came through and then he smashed the rest of the glass with his foot. He entered the house through the window. He pushed a lounge chair out of the way and pushed her out of the way and went looking through the house. The mother and the daughter reached in and grabbed her by the arm and tried to drag her through the window. She managed to resist. She was afraid for her children. She gave her daughter R a cordless telephone and told her to ring 000. She spoke to the emergency operator herself. At one point she was trying to push the girls into the safety of R’s bedroom and told them to lock the door and not to open it. The appellant’s son H was looking through the house. His wife and daughter dragged her out of R’s bedroom. The appellant was pacing in the open space between the dining room and the lounge. They were all talking at once saying, “get out here” and yelling and swearing. She went on to describe the attack made by the appellant’s wife and daughter, punching her and pulling her hair out.  
     
      
    7 Ms Keeley’s daughter R gave evidence. She said that the appellant, his wife and the two children were together at the front of the Keeley house, walking towards it and yelling things like “come out here and fight me”. Her mother said that it was nothing to do with them. She saw them walk into the yard. Her mother came into the house and locked the door. The four then climbed up on the veranda and she saw them there, yelling to her mother to come outside, knocking on the windows and banging on the wall. Her mother told her to use the phone to dial 000, and after the window broke she did so. She went to her bedroom with other children. She remained in the room and heard loud noises as though the house was being smashed. At one point her mother tried to get into the room, but R was sitting on the floor behind the door and made it difficult for her to do so. She stayed on the telephone until she heard the sirens and the arrival of the police. She did not see the appellant in the house.  
     
      
    8 Ms Keeley’s son J gave evidence. He was in his bedroom, which faced the front of the house. He heard voices, yelling, and his mother yelling. He looked quickly out the front and saw H walking with the appellant. The appellant had a piece of wood in his hand. He picked up his telephone and wallet and ran out through the back door. He jumped over his back fence into the back yard of a neighbour, Steven King. He and King telephoned the police from the kitchen of that house. The people he spoke to told him to stay on the phone until he heard the sirens, so he did so. He was worried about his mother and sisters, so he was watching out of the kitchen window of the house he was in. He saw the appellant walk out of the back door with his son H. They walked down the back steps, around the back yard, had a look and then re-entered the house. When he heard the police sirens he disconnected the telephone, went back over the fence and returned home. When he got into the house he saw police and ambulance officers. He saw the appellant’s wife, son and daughter but not the appellant himself.  
     
      
    9 Mr King gave evidence that did not entirely correspond with that of J. He said that when the noise began he was in the Keeley house with J. He heard yelling in the street. He could not hear what was being said but that they called Ms Keeley a slut. He heard the window break. He and J went into the lounge and saw H and his sister in the lounge. He and J went to the back of the house, jumped the back fence and went to ring the police. He agreed that he had made his statement to the police only about two weeks before he gave evidence. He did not see the appellant in the Keeley house or in the back yard.  
     
      
    10 The appellant gave evidence. He appeared to agree that he, his wife, son and daughter had approached the house, but said that he remained outside the fence facing the front door. He did not even go into the yard. He admitted that he had lied to the police in an interview when he denied that his son or his daughter had entered the house. He agreed that they had entered the house. He said that he had lied in order to protect them. He said that his wife and the two children went into the house and he saw his wife come out, escorted by the police. He denied holding a piece of wood. He said that Ms Keeley had pushed H and had called P a “fucking black nigger”.  
     
      
    11 H gave evidence. He, too, said that Ms Keeley had pushed him and had used towards his sister the words uttered by the appellant. He admitted that he had entered the house.  
     
      
    12 P gave evidence. She, too, spoke of the pushing and the words attributed to Ms Keeley. She admitted entering the house.  
     
      
    13 Neither H nor P recalled ever seeing the appellant in the house.  
     
      
    14 There were other witnesses as well, though I do not find it necessary to summarise their evidence.  
     
      
    15 Mr Marr, for the appellant, conceded that there was sufficient evidence which, if accepted, was apt to satisfy the jury of the appellant’s guilt. Although he did not abandon this ground of appeal he did not, I thought, press it with any vigour. Plainly there was an abundance of evidence from Ms Keeley and from her son J to prove the presence of the appellant in the house. The frightening circumstances that undoubtedly took place may have been apt to result in mistaken recollection, though my reading of the transcript of evidence does not suggest that the two persons who identified the appellant as an entrant were mistaken. It seems to me that the conflicts in the evidence were peculiarly of the type that can only properly be resolved by a jury seeing and listening to the witnesses. Acknowledging the superior position of the jury I conclude that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on the evidence of Ms Keeley and J that the appellant was in the Keeley house at relevant times.  
     
      
    16 I would dismiss this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    17 The remaining two grounds of appeal may be dealt with together. They are that the trial judge erred in directing the jury in his summing up in relation to majority verdicts and that he erred in directing the jury in relation to majority verdicts when he gave a direction in accordance with Black v The Queen (1993) 179 CLR 44.  
     
      
    18 During the summing up his Honour said this to the jury -  
     
      
       
        
        Under our system of law, your verdict, whether it be guilty or not guilty, ought to be unanimous. That is not to say that each of you must agree upon the same reasons for your verdict. You may individually rely upon different parts of the evidence, or place a different emphasis on parts of the evidence. However, by whatever route you each arrive at that ultimate decision of guilty or not guilty, that final decision must be the decision of you all, that is, unanimously before it can become your verdict. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        You may know the law now permits me, in certain circumstances, to accept a majority verdict. Those circumstances have not yet arisen, so that when you retire I must ask you to reach a verdict upon which each one of you is agreed. Should, however, the time come when it is possible for me to accept a verdict which is not unanimous, I will give you a further direction. 
        
       
      
    19 At the end of the summing up, immediately before he invited the jury to retire to consider its verdict, his Honour dealt with some final matters. There was this paragraph -  
     
      
       
        
        Thirdly, if you reach a stage of your deliberations when you think you are just not going to be able to reach a unanimous verdict, send me a note to that effect and I will endeavour to provide some further assistance. 
        
       
      
    20 Almost one and a half hours later the jury wrote a note, MFI 9, in the following terms -  
     
      
       
        
        ”At the moment, the verdict is as follows. Seven by guilty, five by not guilty. At the present time no-one is willing to change"". 
        
       
      
    21 This exchange between his Honour and counsel ensued -  
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I have in mind giving the jury a Black direction. Any views? 
         
         
        HARRISON  
        (for the Crown): 
         That would be the only appropriate course. They seem to have reached the conclusion reasonably quickly and individually. Whether or not - I suppose there's only two course, either a full Black direction or your Honour asks them to take about it a little bit more without going into the full Black direction but-- 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, I think they need the assistance of those components of the Black direction that invite them to listen to others and challenge their own thoughts but nevertheless remain true to their oath. Mr Marr? 
        
       
       
        
        MARR 
         (defence counsel):  
        They have been out less than an hour and a half. There's quite a lot of evidence. I am in your Honour's hands. They probably should be given some assistance, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. I am just wondering whether I should tell them. Part of the modified Black direction that is now suggested includes this. The circumstances in which I may take a majority verdict have not yet arisen, and you should still consider that your verdict of guilty or not guilty must be unanimous. I just wonder whether I should say something to the effect of when the circumstances do arise, in which I may accept a majority verdict, the majority is 11/one and not any less than that. I am just wondering whether the jury are thinking, well, we are a majority now. We can't advance it and they are looking for some indication as to when such a majority can be accepted. 
        
       
       
        
        MARR: I must confess I have not looked at the law in relation to majority verdicts. I haven't had to deal with it. I should have looked at it. Your Honour, is there some period of time involved before-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The provisions of the Jury Act now provide that I may - and it is a matter for my discretion - but I may accept an 11/one majority verdict, assuming a full jury of 12, once a reasonable time has elapsed, the jury have been deliberating for a reasonable amount of time, but that such reasonable time must not be less than eight hours. The circumstances in which I can discharge a jury on one view of the provisions, is upon my satisfaction that they will not reach a majority verdict, and that is a little awkward when the time has not yet arisen when I can even accept one. 
        
       
       
        
        I am just wondering if, for example, the jury were to remain deadlocked, as they are, or there is some slight movement, but they come back in another hour or something like that and say, we're still at this situation, on one view of the provisions I could not discharge them until I was satisfied they could not reach an 11/one majority. So I am just wondering whether I should be clear with them from the outset, what I am talking about, when I am talking about a majority verdict and so forth, so that it comes as no surprise to them later on when I am telling them about it. I can't see any harm in it myself to disclose that little piece of information.  
        
       
       
        
        MARR: Your Honour, I don't think it would necessarily assist the accused if they were told now about 11/one but if your Honour said something about the limited circumstances in which there can be a majority verdict, what the jury has presently indicated would not satisfy that, and that the time has not arisen - has not yet arisen - in which that could be considered.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: What I might say is this. Adding to the passage I just referred to, when I refer to a majority verdict, the law now provides that in certain circumstances a verdict of guilty or not guilty, agreed upon by 11 of you can be accepted. Those circumstances, as I have said, have not yet arisen. Your verdict, at this stage, must be agreed upon by all 12. I don't see any harm in giving them that piece of information really.  
        
       
       
        
        Potentially, also I could tell them that it has got to be after a minimum of eight hours deliberation, but I don't know that I need to - that that would be useful to them, at this stage.  
        
       
       
        
        MARR: My concern is that after being out for an hour and a half they may then attempt to come to a majority verdict, instead of being deadlocked for eight hours. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well, I'm being clear with them that their verdict must be a unanimous one. I cannot accept a majority verdict. That's further confirmed in a latter stage of the suggested direction. Anything further. Can I have the jury, please. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    22 The jury returned to court and his Honour gave the following further directions -  
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I've received a note from you which is in these terms: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""At the moment, the verdict is as follows. Seven by guilty, five by not guilty, and at the present time no-one is willing to change"". 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There is a further direction I can give you in these circumstances. Before I do so I should indicate that is unnecessary for you to disclose the split in your consideration of your verdict. The only thing that is important to me, at this stage, is that you are split and you are unable to agree. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I have the power to discharge you from giving a verdict but I should only do so if I am satisfied that there is no likelihood of genuine agreement being reached after further deliberation. 
         
        There seems to be some sort of a disturbance in a room, in a lower room, of this building. I would ask for your forbearance and see if you can concentrate on what I am saying. 
        
       
       
        
        The circumstances in which I may take a majority verdict have not yet arisen, and you should still consider that your verdict of guilty or not guilty must be unanimous. Now, when I refer to a majority verdict, the law now provides that in certain circumstances a verdict of guilty or not guilty agreed upon by eleven out of twelve jurors may be accepted. Those circumstances, as I have said, have not yet arisen, so you must confine yourself to attempting to reach a unanimous verdict either way of guilty or not guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        Experience has shown that juries can often agree if given more time to consider and discuss the issues. But if after calmly considering the evidence, and listening to the opinions of other jurors, you cannot honestly agree with the conclusions of other jurors, you must give effect to your own view of the evidence. Each of you has either sworn or affirmed that you will give a true verdict according to the evidence, and that is an important responsibility. You must fulfil it to the best of your ability. Each of you, as I have indicated earlier, takes into the jury room your individual experience and wisdom and you are expected to judge the evidence fairly and impartially in that light. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        You also have a duty to listen carefully and objectively to the views of every one of your fellow jurors. You should calmly weigh up one another's opinions about the evidence and test them by discussion. Calm and objective discussion of the evidence often leads to a better understanding of the differences of opinion, which you may have, and may convince you that your original opinion was wrong. That is not, of course, to suggest that you can consistently with your oath, or your affirmation, as a juror join the verdict if you do not honestly and genuinely think it is a correct one. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I remind you your verdict, whether it be guilty or not guilty, must be a unanimous one. All twelve of you must in the end agree upon that verdict. It may be that the particular paths which lead each of you to that unanimous decision are not quite the same, but nevertheless your verdict of guilty or not guilty must be the verdict of you all. In other words, provided that you all agree that a particular verdict should be given, it does not matter that you do not agree as to why that particular verdict should be given. Experience has shown that juries are able - often able - to agree in the end if they are given more time to consider and discuss the evidence and for that reason Judges usually request juries to re-examine the matters on which they are in disagreement and to make a further attempt to reach a verdict before they may be discharged. Now in this case, of course, we have quite a deal of evidence. Four plus days of evidence both in the Crown case and the defence case. There is a degree of inconsistency between witnesses. There are assessments to be made as to what you make of the accuracy, reliability, honesty of the various witnesses, and then you have the arguments that were put to you in the closing addresses of the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the accused last Friday, which took all up close to two hours. So, there is quite a deal of material for you to consider and to discuss. So I would ask you to retire again and see whether you can reach a unanimous verdict in this trial. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. 
        
       
      
    23 More than two hours later the jury returned with its verdict. The transcript records this exchange -  
     
      
       
        
        CLERK OF ARRAIGNS: Would the foreman please stand. Have the jury agreed upon a verdict according to the directions that were given? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: Yes they have. 
        
       
       
        
        CLERK OF ARRAIGNS: How say you, is the accused John Ngati guilty or not guilty? 
        
       
       
        
        FOREPERSON: Guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Thank you Mr Foreman, sit down.  
        
       
      
    24 It was submitted that the jury appeared to have been confused by the directions they had been given on majority verdicts and so inappropriately disclosed their voting figures. Then, after the Black direction, one or more jurors may have gained the impression that it was inevitable that a verdict by majority would be permitted eventually and might therefore have joined in a verdict with which they did not agree.  
     
      
    25 Before dealing with these grounds of appeal I should mention a further matter. The first passage extracted from the summing-up is taken almost verbatim from the Criminal Trials Courts Bench Book, a publication of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales now generally available to practitioners as well as judges. Counsel informed the Court that there was a divergence of opinion among judges in the District Court about whether it was appropriate for a judge directing a jury even to mention the existence of majority verdicts until the time had arrived when it was appropriate for such a verdict to be delivered. After a good deal of hesitation, counsel for the appellant invited the Court to deal with the appeal alternatively on the wider basis that a miscarriage of justice would follow if a trial judge so much as mentioned the existence of majority verdicts before the time arrived for the delivery of such of verdict.  
     
      
    26 In my view there are several features of the present appeal which make it inappropriate for disposal on such a wide basis, including the late emergence of the submission, without full and considered argument, and the fact that, for reasons which will appear, the jury in the present case plainly returned a unanimous verdict.  
     
      
       
      Were the jury confused?  
       
      
    27 The principal contention on these grounds was that there was a miscarriage of justice because the jury were confused by the reference to a verdict by majority. Counsel referred to the judgment of this Court in R v RJS [2007] NSWCCA 241, a case in which, as in the present case, the jury delivered a verdict after they had reported having difficulty agreeing and after the consequent Black direction. The problem in RJS was that although the jury were told that they should continue to try to reach a unanimous verdict, they were at the same time told, in effect, that if they were unable to do so within quite a short time (effectively, I think, fifteen minutes) the Court would accept a verdict by majority. So the information which followed immediately upon the direction to return a unanimous verdict completely undermined it.  
     
      
    28 Counsel also referred to the Victorian case of R v VST [2003] VSCA 35, referred to in para [23] of RJS, in which the Victorian Court of Appeal considered it wiser for a judge sending a jury back to continue to try to reach a unanimous verdict to avoid telling them that the time at which a majority verdict might be accepted was imminent.  
     
      
    29 There was no such flavour in anything his Honour said to the jury in the present appeal. The jury were told a second time that the circumstances in which a majority verdict might be accepted had not yet arisen. His Honour gave no indication when, or, I think, even whether, those circumstances would arise. In my view nothing his Honour said was calculated to water down the plain instruction that a unanimous verdict was necessary. And after that, more than two hours elapsed before the jury delivered its verdict. 
     
      
    30 Neither do I think that the manner in which the verdict was announced assists the appellant’s case. It is correct to say, as has been submitted, that the words usually uttered after a unanimous verdict viz “so says your foreman, so say you all” were absent. Even so, the foreman affirmatively answered the question whether the jury had agreed upon a verdict “accordingly to the directions that were given”. In view of the directions that were given that could only have meant that the verdict about to be delivered was the verdict of all twelve members of the jury.  
     
      
    31 In my opinion this ground of appeal has not been made good. I would dismiss the appeal against conviction.  
     
      
    32 Before passing to the sentence, I should mention a further aspect of the trial. I have noted that his Honour in reading out the contents of the jury note informed those present how the foreman had reported that the jury were voting at that time.  
     
      
    33 When a judge receives a message from a jury dealing with its deliberations as a jury, two potentially conflicting principles may come into play. The first is the fundamental requirement of the administration of the criminal law that a trial and every aspect of the trial must take place in open court: R v Smith [1982] 2 NSWLR 608 at [611] per Street CJ. So the accused is entitled to know if there is a communication between the jury as a jury and the trial judge. There are exceptions to this general rule, however, and the important one for present purposes is that the deliberative processes of the jury should be and remain confidential. Counsel for the appellant said as much when he described the disclosure by the jury of voting figures as inappropriate. The principles to which I have referred are uncontroversial and because this matter does not determine the disposal of the appeal may be dealt with briefly. They and their authorities are gathered in R v Burrell [2007] NSWCCA 65 at [253] – [266].  
     
      
    34 Obviously his Honour was obliged, having received the note, to inform counsel and the accused of its receipt. Since the note responded to an invitation made during the summing-up and effectively requested further directions it was appropriate for counsel to be told about its context and its general tenor. Counsel had to be adequately informed of the difficulty the jury were having so that they could assist the Court by making submissions they considered appropriate. However, they did not need to know the voting figures in order to respond and, in my opinion his Honour ought not to have published those figures.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      The sentence appeal 
       
      
    35 His Honour sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for three years and nine months, comprising a non-parole period of two years and a balance of term of one year and nine months. It was submitted that the sentence was harsh, notwithstanding that the maximum penalty for this offence is twenty years’ imprisonment and the standard non-parole period five years. It was submitted that Ms Keeley suffered only very minor injuries, not requiring any treatment. It was submitted, and may be accepted, that the appellant had no criminal record of any significance.  
     
      
    36 In dealing with the objective seriousness of the offence, his Honour, having referred to the victim impact statement provided by Ms Keeley, found that she and her children had been most distressed and had had to move from the Campbelltown region. That had caused upheaval to their lives in many ways, including in employment, schooling and in general social and familial relations. His Honour observed that Ms Keeley continued to endure certain psychological trauma.  
     
      
    37 His Honour accepted that the offence occurred fairly spontaneously and that the attackers made no attempt to disguise themselves. The appellant was motivated by whatever he understood had previously happened in relation to Ms Keeley. The evidence did not enable his Honour to find precisely what that understanding was except that the incident resulted from members of the appellant’s family taking umbrage at Ms Keeley’s remonstration with the young man. His Honour observed that it was an element of the offence that it was committed in company, but observed that an aggravating feature was constituted by the number of offenders, which exceeded the number necessary to constitute the element of “in company”. It was also an aggravating feature that the premises were broken and entered when it was known that there were people inside. There were not only Ms Keeley but four children, two of them as young as seven and eight years. The incident was most terrifying for all of them. His Honour accepted that the offender did not involve himself directly in the assault upon Ms Keeley but found that as head of the family, his presence, influence and encouragement were instrumental in the offence.  
     
      
    38 Having referred to the wide range of offences contemplated by the section under which the charge was brought, his Honour concluded that the offence fell below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Accordingly, his Honour determined not to apply the standard non-parole period, but observed that it retained its place as a benchmark against which to assess the sentence.  
     
      
    39 None of these conclusions or findings came under attack. The general submission was that there must have been error somewhere in the sentencing process because the result was a sentence that was so long as to be above the range of available discretion. Reference was also made to the sentences imposed upon Mrs Ngati and the children. In fact Ms Ngati had pleaded guilty to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company and had asked that an offence of entering with intent to commit an indictable offence be taken into account. She was sentenced by another judge of the District Court to imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of one year. Twenty-five per cent discount was allowed for her plea of guilty. Mrs Ngati’s offence attracted a maximum penalty of seven years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    40 His Honour noted that the two children had pleaded guilty in the Children’s Court to more minor offences and each had been placed on a twelve-month probation order.  
     
      
    41 His Honour concluded that no real issue of parity arose in view of the differential way in which the offences of the other members of the appellant’s family had been dealt with.  
     
      
    42 In my opinion there is no substance in any of the submissions made on appeal. The non-parole period, being forty per cent of the standard non-parole period, was well within his Honour’s range of sentencing discretion. So was the total term of the sentence. As to the question of disparity it seems to me that the respective sentences bear the kind of relationship one would expect them to have, given that Mrs Ngati pleaded guilty to a much less serious offence. The comparison between sentences imposed in the higher courts and in the Children’s Court is permissible, of course, though not without its difficulties, arising principally from the unique measures the Children’s Court may take in dealing with young offenders. However, it does not seem to me that the appellant has demonstrated any entitlement to a more lenient sentence on account of the sentences imposed upon his wife and children, particularly in view of the fact that if he had not been present giving his encouragement, this attack might never have happened.  
     
      
    43 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant, who is unrepresented, seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. At his request the applicant appeared in this Court by video-link. In respect of an offence of break and enter, committed on 26 May 2006, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years with a total sentence of 4 years imprisonment. The applicant received a fixed term of 2 years, to be served concurrently with the sentence to which I have just referred, in respect of an unrelated offence of demand property with menaces. In sentencing the applicant for that offence, the sentencing judge took into account two matters on a Form 1 document, namely offences of goods in custody and making a false statement to a pawnbroker. The applicant also received a further wholly concurrent sentence for an offence of take and drive a conveyance.  
     
      
    2 In respect of a further offence of break and enter, committed on 6 June 2006, a non-parole period of 2 years with a total sentence of 4 years imprisonment was imposed upon the applicant. This sentence was ordered to commence 12 months after the commencement of the earlier sentence. The total effective non-parole period is thus one of 3 years with the effective total sentence being 5 years. The applicant was on parole at the time that the present offences were committed. Although his parole was revoked, the sentences to which I have referred were ordered by the sentencing judge to run concurrently with that order of revocation. 
     
      
    3 It is unnecessary to recite the facts of the various offences in any great detail. Each of the break and enter offences was committed upon a private residence. On the first occasion, the applicant took a number of items of electrical equipment. On the second occasion, he was in the process of removing a plasma TV when he was disturbed by the owner of the premises when she returned home. The applicant’s fingerprints were located at each of the two residences. The applicant used the stolen vehicle in order to commit these offences.  
     
      
    4 The victim of the offence of demand property with menaces was the applicant’s aging mother. The incident, which took place in a club, was captured on CCTV. The applicant declined to speak to police about the various offences when he was arrested. 
     
      
    5 The sentencing judge had the benefit of a comprehensive psychological report prepared by the firm of Duffy Barrier and Robilliard. The applicant gave evidence during the course of the sentencing proceedings and also provided a letter which he had prepared for the sentencing judge. That material provided his Honour with considerable information about the applicant’s background. 
     
      
    6 The applicant’s father died when he was 15. Thereafter he became addicted to drugs. Although he has undergone, with varying degrees of success, a number of rehabilitation programs over the course of his life, the applicant has seemingly always relapsed and resumed taking drugs. He has nonetheless managed to find work as an electrician. The applicant who is now aged 41, has two sons to whom he is devoted. The sentencing judge found that the applicant was remorseful and extended to him a discount of 25% to reflect the fact that he had entered pleas of guilty at an early stage of proceedings. To the applicant’s credit, his mother is still supportive of him. 
     
      
    7 The applicant has an extensive criminal history which began as far back as 1984. Since then he has been before the courts on a very regular basis. He has numerous convictions for offences of dishonesty, many of which involve break and enters. Furthermore, he has been imprisoned on a number of occasions for such offences. Indeed he had only been released on parole for a period of 3 months following a sentence for an earlier offence of break and enter when he committed the present offences. As the sentencing judge correctly observed, that was a matter of considerable aggravation. In the circumstances his Honour concluded that a measure of personal deterrence was called for. His Honour did nonetheless moderate the sentences that he would otherwise have imposed to reflect the fact that the applicant’s custodial circumstances were more onerous than would normally be the case. That was because he was in protective custody by reason of the fact that he had been assaulted in gaol whilst serving an earlier sentence. 
     
      
    8 The applicant’s first ground of appeal is that although a pre-sentence report was ordered, no such report was presented to the court. It is not clear as to whether one was ever prepared. It is to be observed that he was represented during the sentence proceedings by a solicitor employed by the Legal Aid Commission. 
     
      
    9 The applicant asserts in his written submissions that he informed his legal representative “in the cells below the court that [he] wished not to proceed at the time”. He also asserted that he had made a complaint to the Legal Aid Commission about his representation. No further particulars of that complaint are provided. 
     
      
    10 As I have previously indicated, a comprehensive psychological report was tendered during the course of the sentencing proceedings. That report was prepared at the instigation of the Legal Aid Commission and was evidently requested subsequent to the order for a pre-sentence report being made. The report, which ran for 10 typed pages, covered a range of issues which were of potential relevance to the sentencing proceedings. Not only did it set out pertinent details about the applicant’s background but it also reviewed his drug taking history, his medical history, his psychological history, his mental state, and his attitude to the offences. The author of the report also administered a psychometric assessment of the applicant before offering a clinical opinion about the applicant. As I have said, that material was supplemented by evidence from the applicant himself. In the circumstances, it is difficult to see what additional assistance the sentencing judge could have been derived from a pre-sentence report. It may well be that the applicant’s legal representative saw no reason to burden the court with any further material. In any event he certainly made no application for the proceedings to be adjourned in order that one could be obtained. I would reject this ground of appeal since it has not been demonstrated that any prejudice was suffered by the applicant by reason of the court not having available to it a pre-sentence report. 
     
      
    11 The second ground of appeal complains that the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive. As I understand the situation, the real nub of the applicant’s submission is that all sentences should have been ordered to run concurrently. As the applicant puts it “the only reason for me pleading guilty to one of the [break and enter offences] was to have both run together. I know this may seem too late now, as I wished not to waste further of the Crown’s time by taking it to trial.” 
     
      
    12 So long of course as there was an appropriate acknowledgement by the applicant of his guilt of the various offences (which there was), then his motivation for doing so was irrelevant. Moreover, there was convincing evidence of his guilt.  
     
      
    13 More significantly, the applicant’s solicitor expressly conceded that a measure of accumulation was called for. That was an entirely proper concession to make in all the circumstances of the case. These were, after all, entirely separate acts of criminality committed on separate days involving different victims. In my view, there was simply no occasion for the imposition of wholly concurrent sentences for all offences. Accordingly, I would reject this part of the applicant’s submission. 
     
      
    14 Nor would I accept the submission that the sentences imposed, either individually or in their overall effect, were manifestly excessive. I have come to that conclusion in view of the serious nature of the various offences, the fact that the applicant was on parole at the time and because he had an extensive criminal history which included, as I have said, numerous convictions for offences of a similar kind. Moreover, there was also already a degree of in-built leniency in the sentences imposed insofar as a number of them were ordered to be served concurrently. Furthermore, the sentencing judge made a finding of special circumstances to enable the applicant to have the benefit of an extended period on parole within which to overcome his dependency upon illicit drugs. 
     
      
    15 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    16 HODGSON JA: I agree. 
     
      
    17 KIRBY J: I also agree. 
     
      
    18 HODGSON JA: The order of the Court will be that leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Sorby DCJ at Sydney District Court. The applicant pleaded guilty to a single count of soliciting to murder, a crime for which the legislature has prescribed a maximum sentence of twenty five years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of ten years. The applicant is a plumber by occupation having been born in 1955. He has been married twice, the first marriage ending in divorce. From his first marriage there are four children, one of whom is a son Khater, who is also known as Kevin. It is convenient to refer to him as the latter. The applicant has an infant daughter born in 2004 from his second marriage. He has prior convictions for obscene exposure and driving with a prescribed mid-range concentration of alcohol in his blood but these convictions can be ignored as of no weight in the present matter. 
     
      
    2 On 2 May 2003 the applicant’s son Kevin was arrested and charged with offences including aggravated sexual assault upon a then sixteen year old girl, whom I will refer to as R. Kevin was detained in custody on remand at the MRRC Silverwater. He was sharing a cell and spoke to his cellmate about having R killed so that she could not give evidence against him. He asked whether the cellmate knew anyone who might perform the killing. The cellmate said that he would make enquiries, however he in fact reported the approach to authorities. Thereafter, in cooperation with police he posed as a go-between with an undercover police officer (UCO) who pretended to be willing to kill R for a fee of $23,000. 
     
      
    3 An issue was raised in the appeal concerning some commentary on the facts as set out in written submissions on behalf of the applicant which the Crown did not accept as accurate. In response, counsel drew attention to the content of intercepted telephone calls and the product of a listening device. The thrust of the applicant’s submission about what this content showed was three-fold, that the applicant became a participant in the crime after the planning between Kevin and the UCO was complete, that he was a reluctant participant and being urged both by the UCO and his son and did what he did in response to urging from those sources and, although he had paid a “deposit” of $3,000 he had no intention of making any further payment and had detached himself from the UCO when he was arrested. 
     
      
    4 I am unable to conclude that any of these matters were obligatory findings to be made by his Honour. The findings which his Honour made were open to him and in relevant part, they were: 
     
      
       
        
        “The facts reveal the offender, and adult, agreeing to fund the cruel and callous murder of (R), the victim of a sexual assault at the hands of his son, to prevent her giving evidence against his son. The telephone taps reveal that the offender’s main concern was how he could manage to find the $23,000 fee, given his business commitments as a builder. Nowhere in the telephone taps is recorded any sympathy for the victim, (R), or any reservations on the part of the offender that what he was paying for and participating in was morally and legally wrong. Nowhere does he attempt to dissuade his son from his plan to murder (R), nor does he raise the idea of going to the police. This is a crime of objective seriousness involving as it does a plan to murder (R), the innocent victim of sexual assault committed by his son, a crime that also involves the elimination of a crown witness which strikes at the very heart of our system of justice.” 
        
       
      
    5 His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of ten years and a balance term of four years.  
     
      
    6 The applicant relies upon five grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    7 Ground 1: His Honour erred in treating the use of the ‘threatened use of violence’ as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    8 In his remarks on sentence, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In aggravation there was threatened use of violence against the victim (R). The offender was aware of the cruel and barbaric way his son, the co-offender, wanted (R) ‘finished’ as he put it ‘gunshots to different parts of (R)’s body’.” 
        
       
      
    9 The table of aggravating factors in s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act) includes in subs (b) the actual or threatened use of violence.  
     
      
    10 In an electronically recorded interview with police (at question 76) the applicant revealed that he knew of an intention to “put one bullet in her tummy and one here and one here”. What was contemplated was that R would not die as a result of the initial shot but that she should suffer pain from multiple woundings before being released from suffering by death. 
     
      
    11 Other evidence showed more precisely what Kevin intended by way of torture of R, but it is to that which his Honour was no doubt referring when he found that the applicant was aware of the cruel and barbaric way that it was intended that R be killed.  
     
      
    12 The Crown has responded to the submission by pointing to the legislation of a possible aggravating factor of “gratuitous cruelty” as set out in subs (f) of the provision in the Sentencing Act. The Crown submitted that his Honour’s reference to a cruel and barbaric way of intended killing was in harmony with a submission that subs (f) was applicable that had been made at first instance. His Honour did not deal with this contention in terms.  
     
      
    13 Of course, the killing was not in fact carried out so that there was no involvement of gratuitous cruelty in committing the offence of soliciting to murder, however it was intended.  
     
      
    14 Senior counsel for the applicant pointed out that the threat of violence must be an element of the offence of soliciting to murder and therefore is inhibited from being “double counted” as an aggravating factor pursuant to the legislation in s 21A (4). I accept that threatened violence must be an element of such an offence but the inhibition does not extend to preventing a sentencing judge from making some assessment of a relevant level. In my opinion his Honour should be understood as doing no more than that when he observed the awareness of the applicant of the intended cruelty and barbarism.  
     
      
    15 I would reject ground 1. 
     
      
    16 Ground 2: His Honour erred in treating a finding that the offence was ‘part of an organized criminal activity’ as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    17 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the offence was part of an organised criminal activity between the offender and his son and the hit-man, the UCO. There was conversation between the two of them to find the ‘hit-man’, arranged meetings, the agreed price of the killing, and the down-payment of $3,000 by this offender, all of which involved considerable planning on the part of the offender and his son.” 
        
       
      
    18 It is apparent that his Honour was referring to s 21A (2) (n) which postulates planned or organized criminal activity as a possible factor of aggravation. Senior counsel for the applicant submitted that there were two difficulties in applying that legislated factor to the present case.  
     
      
    19 First, it was submitted that the very nature of the offence soliciting to murder involved a degree of planning and organization. This is not necessarily so. In terms of planning or organization the offence can be complete upon an essential communication. There is some authority that the communication need not even reach the intended recipient in order for the offence to be complete: R v Ransford (1874) LTNS 488. Undoubtedly, a considerable part of the planning and organization was undertaken by Kevin through the medium of his cellmate and with the UCO, however, the applicant himself was a participant in the organizing communications, both in encounters with his son and the UCO.  
     
      
    20 Second, it was put that the applicant himself virtually played no part in the organization of the offence. To the contrary the applicant played a critical role in the organization by in fact attending to the payment of the “deposit” and making a promise to find the funds for the balance. 
     
      
    21 In oral submission, and in reference to the intercepted and recorded conversations earlier mentioned, it was put that the planning of the offence was complete before the applicant became involved. So far as Kevin was concerned, he had made the enquiry through his cellmate and solicited the UCO whom he believed to be a willing “contract” killer to “finish” R. 
     
      
    22 The submission failed to recognize the disjunctive in s 21A (2) (n), that is, planned or organized criminal activity. As his Honour’s remarks show, his finding against the applicant related to organization as distinct from planning.  
     
      
    23 I recognize that his Honour used the word “planning” at the conclusion of the passage from his remarks which I have recited but the matters which he described leading up to the use of that word were plainly of activity, that is to say, organization as distinct from planning. 
     
      
    24 I detect no error in his Honour’s approach to these matters. 
     
      
    25 Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to take into account entrapment as a mitigating factor. 
     
      
    26 There is authority for the proposition that the culpability of an accused may be diminished if there is a real possibility that, but for the assistance, encouragement and incitement by police, the offender would not have committed the crime. R v Taouk [1993] 65 A Crim R 387. It is contended that his Honour did not appear to have considered this matter at all. 
     
      
    27 In my view there was not the slightest reason for him so to do. The evidence was that the applicant had agreed to assist his son prior to being contacted by the UCO. The submission that there is no evidence that the applicant was the kind of person who would be involved in the crime such as the present, is in my view, irrelevant. It is true, as counsel pointed out, that the last communication between the UCO and the applicant concluded with an arrangement that the applicant would make further contact and he did not do so. Some eight days after the last encounter he was arrested. There is a recurrent theme throughout conversations in which the applicant was a participant that he was having difficulty in raising the large amount of money, bearing in mind his commitments as a builder, rather than doing anything to see an end to or withdraw from the criminal scheme. 
     
      
    28 His Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        “…he did nothing from that point to stop the plan that the payment of $3,000 had put in motion. He did not go to the police, he did not tell the undercover operative that he would (not) pay the full $20,000 agreed for the murder or that he wanted nothing more to do with the scheme.” 
        
       
      
    29 It was acknowledged that the absence of the negative is a transcription error. Those findings were open to his Honour and contradict the proposition that there was a real possibility that but for the actions of the UCO the applicant would not have committed the crime. 
     
      
    30 I would also reject this ground. 
     
      
    31 Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to give a discount for the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    32 His Honour stated that, having regard to the plea of guilty on the first day of trial, he had decided that “a 10 percent discount is appropriate”. A “back calculation” shows that, if arithmetically precise, his Honour must have used a notional starting point of a total sentence of 15 years and 7 months which, as a matter of general observation, would seem unusual when compared with the majority of assessments by judges which tend to be in round figures or less awkward fractions, unless there are particular circumstances.  
     
      
    33 There was no obligation on his Honour to undertake sentencing in a precise mathematical manner.  
     
      
    34 It is possible that the ultimate figure represents some rounding which may even have been in the applicant’s favour. Of course, it is not open to this Court to speculate upon that, but ultimately its power can only be exercised in terms of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    35 His Honour was not obliged to quantify the “discount”: R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] 49 NSWLR 383. He made reference to the “10 percent” near the end of his remarks and shortly before imposing sentence. I am unpersuaded that it should be concluded that it was overlooked. An indication that it was not can be drawn from matters concerning the ultimate assessment which I will refer to in the context of the next ground. 
     
      
    36 Ground 5: The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    37 Attention is directed to statistics collated by the Judicial Commission. Whilst reference has been made to statistics collected prior to 1 February 2003, in my view these can be of little assistance, having regard to the legislation of a standard non-parole period which came into effect on that date. Since that date the collected statistics provide a survey of only seven cases. One of those seven cases involved a total sentence one year longer than that imposed upon this applicant. However, in terms of the fixing of a non-parole period the next longest period after ten years which has been set in a survey of six cases is six years.  
     
      
    38 It must be acknowledged that, although on the first day of trial, the applicant did plead guilty so that in terms of applicable authority the standard non-parole period operates as a guide rather than being directly applicable: R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168. However, even if it were applicable, that is to say the imposition of sentence followed the conviction of the applicant after trial, it would be a sentence that should relate to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. There is a specific finding by his Honour that this offence is above that mid range.  
     
      
    39 The non-parole period which was set is in fact exactly the standard non-parole period. Upon that finding, had the applicant been convicted after trial (putting to one side other possible reasons for departure) the non-parole period would be expected to be longer than the standard ten years which was imposed upon the applicant.  
     
      
    40 The criminal enterprise was embarked upon in all seriousness. It is the very nature of the crime of solicitation to murder that it consists of an intent and a request. It is appropriate therefore to gauge, in particular, the level of criminality demonstrated in the intent. In this case, for the reasons given by his Honour concerning the intended barbarism and cruelty, the level must be very high and the finding that it is a crime above the mid range of seriousness is unchallengeable. 
     
      
    41 It is true that the pre February 2003 statistics show a pattern of sentencing which can be shown to be lower than that received by the applicant, but the specification of the standard non-parole period evinces a clear legislative intention in regard to a sentence level. 
     
      
    42 It is the duty of courts to give effect to legislation and it is a consequence of the introduction of the standard non-parole period that a sentencing pattern developed in its absence is of little value. 
     
      
    43 That his Honour ultimately specified a non-parole period no greater than the standard shows that the applicant was accorded the benefit of such matters upon which he could call for leniency. It can be mentioned that Kevin received the same sentence for this crime although, in contrast, his plea of guilty was made at the earliest opportunity. No submission was made criticizing his Honour’s decision that there should be parity of sentence between that received by the applicant and by Kevin. 
     
      
    44 The applicant was a participant in a solicitation to murder, the culpability for which has to be adjudged to be of a very high order. I am unpersuaded that any less severe sentence would be warranted. 
     
      
    45 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: 1. Soeun Bun, a forty-two year old Cambodian national has permanent residency in Australia. At the time she was given permanent residency she was a refugee. There is an ignoble poignancy in that she has taken advantage of her permanent residency status to import 120.1 grams of pure heroin on her return from Cambodia, the country she fled into the country that offered her sanctuary. 2. She returned to Sydney Kingsford-Smith Airport on 30 July 2007 with 166 grams of admixture concealed internally within her body. Ten and a half hours after her arrival, a packet of heroin admixture was recovered from her body. 3. Today she is to be held accountable for her criminal conduct in importing a marketable quantity of border controlled drugs contrary to the Commonwealth Criminal Code of 1995. As the sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court, committed by this offender in this community. 4. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to her, that is subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and to the offender. 5. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed as best I can even though the material is not much before me. This is an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. S 16A of the Crimes Act 1914 requires a sentencing judge to take into account a number of specific matters mentioned in both ss (2) and (3). Ss (3)is often ignored. 6. Where a term of imprisonment greater than three years is to be imposed, as indeed one must be in this case, the length of the non parole period is to be determined. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to the length of the non parole period and finally, of course, the ultimate length of term of imprisonment to be imposed.   FACTS7. Miss Bun arrived in Australia in 1988. On 9 May 2007 she purchased a ticket to Phnom Penh via Bangkok. She left on 13 May 2007. The ticket was open for return on 12 August 2007. On 20 July 2007 the booking was changed, the departure from Phnom Penh commenced also via Bangkok on 29 July. 8. Miss Bun came to the attention of the Customs Services Officer Clarke. He selected her for a baggage examination. It would appear Clarke’s curiosity was aroused by a confluence of factors. The trip was the offender’s fourth within a twelve month period. Her incoming passenger card indicated she was unemployed. As events turned out she had been on government benefits since 1988. The plane ticket disclosed a price for the return journey of $1,405. 9. Miss Bun consented to a frisk search. It revealed nothing. She was detained for an internal examination. She denied concealing drugs internally but consented to the examination. She was taken to the St George Hospital. The Australian Federal Police now became involved. 10. Again she denied, this time to the AFP agent, the presence of any foreign object within her body. A CT scan revealed that falsehood. A packet of heroin admixture was concealed in her vagina. When challenged by AFP agents she conceded the packet contained drugs, but claimed not to know the nature of those drugs. Once the packet of heroin admixture was recovered the offender was taken to AFP headquarters. 11. The account she gave was that she had a boyfriend. Her children had been taken from her. She had gone to Cambodia to visit her relatives including her aged mother. She had stayed in Cambodia for two months staying at different places. She had received money from her boyfriend in Australia and her children (she has one seventeen year old daughter living with her). 12. She had the drugs in her when she caught the plane in Phnom Penh. Although she did not know the type of drugs she did know how the drugs had been wrapped. She had at least some idea of the quantity of drugs she was carrying. She was asked how much she had paid for the drugs. Her response was not to deny she had purchased the drugs but rather simply to say, “I don't know”. Nor did she know how much she was to be paid for bringing the drugs in. Nor was she prepared to reveal what she was going to do with the drugs. 13. This interview does not reveal a great desire to cooperate with the AFP. The admixture of heroin had a purity of seventy-two per cent. The AFP estimated its street value as falling somewhere between $100,000 to $420,000 depending upon the purity of the deals made from the imported product. The seizure equated to 2,000 to 6,000 street deals. If sold wholesale it would sell for somewhere between $6,000 and $9,000 per ounce. Sold at these prices its full value fell between $35,000 and $52,000 on the wholesale market. 14. The offender’s seventeen year old daughter resides with her. There are six other children aged thirteen to twenty-five years, all of whom live in Australia. Four of them live in foster care. She has little or no contact with these children. 15. In her evidence the offender’s account was she had a gambling problem, she was a poker machine addict. A Vietnamese man whom she did not identify lent her $500 to $1,000 on several occasions. She ended up $10,000 in debt over a three month period. Two weeks before she went to Cambodia a man arrived at her house at night. She claimed he hid his face. Her evidence was he forced her do “it”, saying he would do something to her children because she owed money. 16. She gave this man her mobile phone number and her picture. Her evidence was that she had saved $10,000 and her boyfriend gave her money. She was asked to buy her own ticket. The contraband was to be picked up from her house after delivery. While she was in Cambodia her boyfriend sent her $200 per week. 17. While in Cambodia she was contacted by the drug merchants. The rendezvous point was a taxi stand. The drug packet was inserted while she was concealed in a taxi. She caught another taxi to the Phnom Penh airport. It would appear her debt of $10,000 was to be forgiven. She was unsure whether she would be given any other monetary reward. 18. There was a significant inconsistency in her account. I am satisfied she was not frank with the Court. She has been deliberately vague as to not noticing anything about the Vietnamese man who came to her house, assuming such a person did arrive. Likewise, she has been deliberately vague about the Vietnamese man who lent her money, assuming there is such a man, to play the poker machines. 19. Her claim of saving $10,000 to pay her fare was not explored and makes little sense. I am satisfied this unwillingness to be forthright is motivated by a fearfulness she has of the principal or principals who sent her to Cambodia. I am also satisfied she knew she was to bring contraband into Australia on her return and undertook the trip for that purpose primarily. 20. Her visit and stay in Cambodia was part of the reward she was offered and accepted. OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY 21. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing Judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the incident offences with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. 22. The objective criminality has a very important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 23. The offence of importing heroin is an offence early in the drug trafficking phenomena. Heroin is not grown or manufactured in this country. Of necessity it must be imported. Those who import it illegally must necessarily be seeking to advance the criminal activity of either themselves or of some other person or persons. 24. The importation is inevitably designed for on-supply of heroin to other people. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. The courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of drug offence, it is necessary to have regard to a drug’s potential for harm. 25. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by its direct impact upon those who purchase drugs and by its indirect impact upon the community at large. Heroin is an addictive drug. It contributes to the disenabling of human beings. It creates or sustains drug addicts in varying degrees of addiction. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and to feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by their addiction to a drug. 26. Heroin is a drug of strong addiction. It is the disenabling of other human beings that is the real essence of the criminal harm done by those who supply drugs. In the case of heroin there can be no supplier of heroin unless there is an importer. Those who import drugs are one step away from those disenabling human beings who supply drugs. 27. Associated with drug addiction are other forms of crime such as armed robbery, breaking and entering and stealing. Putting to one side the emotional harm of such crime, the economic impact of such crime is also significant. It is a transference of wealth or of property from those with a legitimate right to that wealth or property to those with no right to it. And all for no corresponding economic benefit to the community. 28. Similarly, the spending of money on drugs by addicts amounts to a monumental transference of wealth. Again without any corresponding economic gain. 29. As I have just mentioned, the economic wealth capable of being transferred in this case is measurable and at the high end could be as much as nearly half a million dollars. 30. When assessing the potential for harm, the Court should keep firmly in mind the quantity of heroin imported. In this case the quantity of heroin imported is a low trafficable or merchantable quantity. Nonetheless, it could still be on-supplied to one or more than one suppliers. Its potential for street harm can be measured in at least two thousand street deals. 31. In this case the drugs were intercepted. No harm has been done to the community. Indeed, a drug courier has been arrested and the effectiveness of the Australian Customs Service demonstrated because the importation was thwarted. As events turned out this is a victimless crime. However, there was a potential for many users to become more disenabled as functioning human beings had this importation succeeded. 32. There is no suggestion of any dependency by this offender on drugs as motivating her criminal conduct. Neither is there any direct link between the offender’s gambling problem and her criminal behaviour. Her evidence is inconsistent. She speaks of saving $10,000. She also speaks of a visit from a shadowy figure forcing her to travel because she owed $10,000. 33. The account given by this offender so closely mirrors the account given to the court in Truong The Pham, a case before me on 21 September 2007 that I have wondered whether the account is part of some pre-arranged provided explanation instructed by the principals who dispatched her to be given to the court in the event she should be captured (see also R v Huynh [2008] NSWCCA 16).34. However, the Crown accepts the gambling problem and the indebtedness to the Vietnamese lender. In light of that concession by the Crown it would be unfair if the Court did not act upon this account. I intend to do so. 35. As said above, the offender’s involvement was not a direct response to her gambling problem. The debt was the direct response, however, the existence of the debt gave the Vietnamese man leverage over her. I am satisfied his intent when advancing money to her was to put her into a position where he had such leverage over her. I am satisfied her response to the leverage was to obtain a financial benefit, namely forgiveness of the debt. That puts her benefit at $10,000. 36. I am satisfied when she provided her photo and mobile phone number she knew she was to return with contraband and then recognised it was probably drugs. In leaving the country to bring contraband she was reckless as to whether it was drugs or not. By the time she had inserted the package into her vagina, I have inferred she must have recognised the contraband was some form of powder substance and must have recognised it as a prohibited drug although the species of the drug may have been unknown to her. She is to be sentenced as a courier of a low level importation, that is 120 grams. 37. This offender who claims to have a gambling problem has been to Cambodia four times in the last year. Her income stream is a NewStart allowance. She is also a renter of premises. In those circumstances I am not prepared to find this was an isolated incident. There has been no attempt in the evidence to establish that it was. The onus is on the defence to prove this incident was isolated if it wanted to take advantage of that fact. 38. On the other hand, the Crown has not established it was part of a series of imports. The Crown would need to have established that if it wanted to rely upon that proposition. In fairness it did not seek to do so. In other words, her four previous trips are neutral but for the proposition that I just advanced. I do not regard her having established it is an isolated incident. SUBJECTIVE MATTERS 39. I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that, not only am I sentencing for this criminal offence but I am also sentencing this particular offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court will vary from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation or insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. 40. This offender is a forty-two year old Cambodian woman, she claims to be single living with her seventeen year old daughter. She told police she had a boyfriend. My memory was, there was no one in Court supporting her on the hearing but it may well be that there is someone here now. She has six other children but little contact with them. She apparently has friends and relatives in Cambodia. 41. She used a translator in Court as is her right. But I am left wondering as to her level of proficiency in English. Associated with that issue is her level of isolation in custody. I cannot form a view as to whether she is likely to be completely isolated in custody but I have come to a view she is likely to be substantially isolated in custody. EDUCATION SKILL AND EMPLOYMENT42. She arrived in Australia aged twenty-two or thereabouts. How long or where she was in refugee camps is not in evidence; nor is her education history. My sense is, she is unsophisticated, uneducated and suspicious. There is no evidence of her possession of any skills. She has had no employment in Australia since her arrival. All of these are areas that will require addressing if she is to have any prospects upon her release from prison. GENERAL HEALTH 43. She presented in Court as well nourished, small in statue and apparently in reasonable general health. Her affect was flat, her tone of speech quiet and subdued. Gambling problems are frequently associated with depression. From my observation of her, depression at some level could not be ruled out. She claims a gambling problem. Her gambling beyond her means is indicative of a pathological gambling problem, but in the absence of proper forensic evidence dealing with other symptoms, I cannot make that finding ( R v Huynh [2008] NSWCCA 16).GUILTY PLEA44. Her plea of guilty was made at an early stage in the Local Court proceedings. It was indicative of her willingness to be held accountable for her actions. The Crown says it was entered in the face of a strong case and that is so. Nonetheless the administration of justice is well served by her plea, she has been willing to facilitate the administration of justice. 45. First and foremost because the interests of administration of justice are served through the public acknowledgement by an offender of her guilt. Pleas of guilty by offenders sustain the community’s confidence in the administration of justice by maintaining the confidence of the community in the investigation of crime and the community’s expectation that those guilty of crime are to be held accountable for it. 46. The administration of criminal justice will also be served because Court time, witnesses’ time, legal expenses and the like are freed so that they can be devoted to other cases. Her plea will reduce considerably the likelihood of any contest in an appeal on the issue of her guilt in respect of this charge. All of these are important factors insofar as the administration of criminal justice is concerned. ATTITUDE TO OFFENCE 47. The offender said in her evidence that she knows the charge she is answering is serious. She knows that she is very wrong and that she would not do it again. I am prepared to accept that she regrets her present situation and recognises the wrongness of her criminal behaviour. Whether she has any insight into drug trading or the evil of drugs is moot, but given her apparent level of education and lack of sophistication, it is unlikely. This was not an offence calling for reparation or repair of injury, loss or damage. PERSONAL DETERRENCE 48. When a person is sentenced to a breach of the criminal law, she is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. In this case the maximum penalty for this offence is twenty-five years imprisonment. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires the sentencing Judge to keep in mind both general and personal deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large, by keeping in mind when sentencing that maximum penalty available and its deterrent purpose. 49. There are also other aspects of personal deterrence which need to be kept in mind. This offender was accosted at the airport by both Australian Customs Officers and Australian Federal Police; was subjected to hospital procedures to discover the heroin mixture hidden within her; was arrested and charged and brought before the Local Court on at least two and possibly more occasions and has been before this Court on two occasions. 50. She is in the process of having, and will have heard her conduct denounced by a judicial officer of this Court. She will indeed endure a period of incarceration. My own view is that she will have experienced all of the personal deterrence that is necessary in this case. ADEQUATE PUNISHMENT 51. This is an offence calling for fulltime imprisonment as the only means of adequate punishment. Punishment and general deterrence are important drivers of this sentence. REHABILITATION PROSPECTS52. There is little in the way of evidence giving insight into Ms Bun’s rehabilitation prospects. She is unlikely to re-offend. If that were the only measure of rehabilitation then the answer on the question of rehabilitation is relatively easy. But she has other problems. Her children are estranged. She is a gambler. She has no working experience or skills. She appears to have little social support. Her legitimate income stream is subsistence level only. She will return to an economically, socially, emotionally and possibly culturally disadvantaged and deprived future. As best I can tell there are no post release plans in place. I have little insight into her psychological profile. Nor do I know anything of her response to custody thus far. 53. Section 16A(2)(p) requires me to consider the probable affect of her sentence on others of importance in her life. At the time of her arrest she claimed a boyfriend and a seventeen year old daughter. So far as one can tell, these two are her closest persons of importance. Her mother and other relatives live in Cambodia and were always likely to be isolated from her. There is no evidence as to what has happened to the boyfriend or seventeen year old daughter, although there are two people in court that fit that description. As the evidence stands I cannot determine what, if any impact, the sentence will have on them. As a matter of common sense there must be some separation; but whether that consequence will cause any serious sense of loss or hardship has not been agitated before the Court. 54. Subsection 3 of 16A of the Crimes Act 1900 requires the Court to have regard to the nature and severity of the conditions that may apply to the offender when determining the appropriate sentencing outcome. For the duration of the non parole period, this offender is likely to be housed in a single sexed prison or a prison where the women are segregated from the men. She will be subject to directions from custodial officers in almost all aspects of her daily life. That will include the location of the prison where she will live. Her capacity to choose will be severely curtailed. 55. She will wear clothing supplied by the prison authorities and distinctive for the purposes of identifying her as prisoner. She will be required to occupy her cell for lengthy periods. Her meals and health needs will be supplied by the government without much regard to her choice. Her fellow prisoners are likely to have personality, health and emotional problems. Some are likely to be dangerous.   SECTION 16(G) 56. In the event it needs to be said so many years after its repeal, I am aware that section 16(G) of the Crimes Act 1914 no longer operates and no longer impacts upon sentence. SENTENCING RANGE57. The Crown in her submission has drawn to my attention to four cases, Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314, 244.6 grams, eight years imprisonment, four and a half non parole. Dang [2004] NSWCCA 269, 218 grams, six years six months with four years four months non parole. Hendricks (2001) 125 A Crim R 303 162 grams, six years six months non parole four years three months. Le [2006] NSWCCA 136 seven years six months, non parole five years for 117 grams. 58. To this list can be added sentences imposed by this Court at first instance and not appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Nhut Thi Hong Ho and Thanh Nhuo (sisters) Berman DCJ; 236 grams, six years head sentence, non parole three years. Phong Linh Nguyen Hock DCJ 700 grams, six years- head sentence, non parole three years. There is also a judgment of Sweeney DCJ, which I am not at the moment able to identify; 108 grams, six years-head sentence, non parole three. To this list can be added the case I earlier referred to Trung Ta Pham Nicholson DCJ 110 grams, five years-head sentence, non parole period three years. The sentence I am imposing takes all those cases into account. FORMAL ORDERS 59. Soeun Bun, you are convicted of the offence that you between 1.00pm and 1.01pm on 30 July 2007 at Mascot did import a substance, the substance being a border control substance, namely heroin and the quantity imported being a marketable quantity, contrary to subs 307.2(1) of the Criminal Code (CTH). For that offence you are sentenced to a period of imprisonment of five and a half years to date from 30 July 2007 and to expire on 29 January 2013. I set a non parole period of three years three months to expire on 29 October 2010. 60. You need to understand that you will be kept in custody because of the orders that I have made. The earliest date that you can be released will be on 29 October 2010. 61. The earliest date that you can be released as I say is 29 October 2010. It will be a matter for the Attorney General of the Commonwealth to determine whether you are to be released on that date. He will take advice from those who have oversighted your custody. If you make progress and rehabilitate during your custody it is most likely he will release you on that day.  62. The Crown prosecutor tells me that the Attorney must release you on 29 October 2010. So it looks like that is the date that is fixed for your release.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BUDDIN J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. In respect of an offence of break, enter and steal committed on 21 July 2005, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years with a total sentence of 4 years imprisonment. In sentencing the applicant for this offence, the sentencing judge took into account two matters of goods in custody which appeared on a Form 1 document. The applicant received fixed terms each of 2 years, to be served concurrently with the sentence to which I have just referred, in respect of two separate offences of take and drive a conveyance. The applicant received a further wholly concurrent fixed term of 3 years for an offence of break, enter and steal committed on 16 July 2005. 
     
      
    2 In respect of a further offence of break and enter and steal, committed on 20 July 2005, a non-parole period of 12 months with a total sentence of 2 years and 6 months imprisonment was imposed upon the applicant. In sentencing the applicant for that offence, the sentencing judge took into account four matters on a Form 1 document, namely three offences of obtaining a benefit by deception and one offence of attempted larceny. This sentence was ordered to commence at the expiration of the earlier sentence. The total effective non-parole period is thus one of 4 years with the effective total sentence being 5 years 6 months.  
     
      
    3 The facts of the various offences can be stated quite briefly. On 16 July 2005 the applicant broke into a residential dwelling in Cowra and stole from it a torch, a wallet, a mobile phone, various keys, and almost $1100 in cash. Later that day the applicant was arrested and found to be in possession of the property which he had stolen from that home.  
     
      
    4 In the early hours of 20 July 2005 the applicant broke into a home at Woodstock whilst the owners and their children were asleep. He stole from the home a mobile phone, credit cards and $350 in cash. Later the same morning he attempted to break into a car at Woodstock. However he was disturbed and made good his escape. This conduct gave rise to the charge of attempted larceny which appeared on one of the Form 1 documents. Later the same day police officers located the mobile phone at his home in Woodstock. The applicant used the credit card of the victim of the break and enter offence, to which I have just referred, together with other improperly obtained credit card numbers to make unauthorised purchases of pornographic videos and other related paraphernalia. This conduct gave rise to the offences of obtaining a benefit by deception which appeared on the same Form 1 document. 
     
      
    5 On 21 July 2005 the applicant broke into a home in Bathurst and stole from it a computer, two mobile telephones, an electronic diary, a Visa card, keys to two motor vehicles and $400 in cash. He took the goods to one of the motor vehicles and then removed both motor vehicles from the premises. Following his arrest, his property was searched and the keys to both vehicles were located. 
     
      
    6 The applicant is now aged 39. He gave evidence before the sentencing judge in which he maintained that he had been the victim of sexual abuse in his early teens. His parents separated when he was 14 and he thereafter commenced using illicit drugs. Although he has made numerous endeavours to overcome his dependency upon drugs, those attempts have always ultimately proved to be unsuccessful. On a number of occasions he has left a rehabilitation program without completing it and more recently he found himself in breach of the Drug Court program. As has so often been the case in the past, the present offences were committed in order to feed the applicant’s drug addiction. Although the applicant professed to be now motivated to address his offending behaviour, the sentencing judge was understandably somewhat sceptical about his capacity to do so. 
     
      
    7 The applicant has an extensive criminal history which began as far back as 1981 when he was only 13. Since then he has been before the courts, both in this State and elsewhere, on a very regular basis. He has numerous convictions for offences of dishonesty, many of which involve break and enters and the theft of motor vehicles. Furthermore, he has been imprisoned on a large number of occasions for such offences. As the sentencing judge observed, the applicant has spent approximately half of his life in custody. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge extended to the applicant a discount of 25% to reflect the fact that he had pleaded guilty to the offences at the earliest opportunity. His Honour was also prepared to find that the applicant was remorseful. His Honour took into account the fact that the applicant was serving his sentence in protective custody because of fears he entertained for his safety from other inmates. His Honour also had regard to the opinion of Professor Greenberg, a forensic psychiatrist, that the applicant has a significant personality disorder associated with a severe poly-substance dependency problem 
     
      
    9 The applicant appeared unrepresented. He provided a written outline of the submissions which he urged in support of the application and amplified those submissions during the course of oral argument.  
     
      
    10 The first complaint made by the applicant is a challenge to the sentencing judge’s finding that the offences were planned. His Honour observed that “counsel for the offender has suggested that the offences were opportunistic. I do not agree. I think there was significant but not substantial planning in relation to the break and enter matters and in relation to the use of the cards.” It was clearly open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the offences involved a measure of planning. So much is inherent in the nature of the offences themselves. Indeed counsel who appeared on behalf of the applicant at the sentencing hearing candidly acknowledged as much. It is not always helpful to provide labels such as “opportunistic” to describe a particular crime particularly when it is committed by a drug addict. Nonetheless in the present context I understand the expression to be used as a means of contrasting the present offences with those involving a measure of professional planning. There is nothing to suggest that his Honour treated the offences of being of the latter kind. In any event, I am satisfied that this issue played little part in the sentencing judge’s determination of the appropriate sentences. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    11 The second ground of appeal arises from the fact that the sentencing judge ordered that the sentences should be partially accumulated. The applicant contends that the sentences should have been made totally concurrent since the offences were committed over a period of only five days. It may be immediately observed that counsel who appeared on behalf of the applicant at the sentencing proceedings conceded that a measure of accumulation was called for.  
     
      
    12 In any event I would reject this submission in view of the fact that there were a number of entirely separate acts of criminality committed on separate days involving different victims. In my opinion there was simply no occasion for the imposition of wholly concurrent sentences for each of the offences.  
     
      
    13 The applicant also complained about what he described as the “severity of sentence”. In oral argument, the applicant confined his submission to a complaint about the length of the non-parole period. Indeed he described the overall sentences imposed by his Honour as being “reasonably fair”. The applicant relied upon two decisions of this Court as being in someway comparable to the circumstances of his case. It suffices to say that the circumstances of those cases are sufficiently different from the present case to be of no real assistance to the disposition of this application.  
     
      
    14 In my view the sentences imposed, either individually or in their overall effect, could not be said to be manifestly excessive. I have come to that conclusion in view of the serious nature of the various offences and the applicant’s extensive criminal history which included, as I have said, numerous convictions for offences of a similar kind. Moreover, there was also already a degree of in-built leniency in the sentences imposed, insofar as a number of them were ordered to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    15 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    16 HODGSON JA: I agree. 
     
      
    17 KIRBY J: I also agree. 
     
      
    18 HODGSON JA: The order of the Court will be that leave to appeal is granted but the appeal is dismissed.

    JUDGMENTA non publication order has been made in relation to the name of the complainant and any identifying details1 The offender, Richard Ivan Noel Kite, has pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual intercourse with person under the age of ten years contrary to section 66A of the Crimes Act 1900.2 The offence occurred between 10:00pm 31 December 2006 and 5:00am on 1 January 2007 at Port Macquarie, in the State of New South Wales.3 The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of 15 years imprisonment for this offence.Facts4 The agreed facts were tendered and marked exhibit S2. The facts were as follows:5 The victim, NG, was born on 11 May 2000 and was 6 years old at the relevant time.6 On 31 December 2006 the offender, Richard Kite, was at 7 Mill Hill, Port Macquarie for a family New Years Eve celebration. The house belonged to Peter Jackson who is the father of the offender’s then defacto partner, Katherine Jackson. Also present at the party that evening were Pam McA – the victim’s grandmother and partner of Peter Jackson; Darren McA – the victim’s father; Krystal Boyd – the defacto of Darren McA; Suzanne Mc A – the victim’s aunty; and Kerry Scott – Suzanne McA’s defacto.7 A number of children were also present, including the victim, Darren McA’s son, Suzanne’s three children and her niece and the offender’s 4 year old step-daughter and 4 month old son.8 The offender had not met the victim previously. She arrived at the house at about 6pm that night.9 In the early part of the evening, the offender and the children were playing in the backyard swimming pool. The victim was wearing only her underwear and the offender was wrestling and playing in the pool with her.10 Throughout the course of the night, most adults were drinking and occupied the front lounge room of the house. Towards the rear of the house, a number of children, including the victim, were sleeping and playing around at various times on lounges in the sunroom.11 Between 10pm and midnight, all adults within the house were seated in the front lounge room, playing card games. Prior to midnight the card game came to a halt. The adults commenced playing pool in the garage until well after midnight. The offender left the pool game on numerous occasions and went into the sun room where some of the children were sleeping on lounges.12 On one occasion the offender stated that he was going to refill his drink. He was gone for a period of over five minutes – despite the fact that he still had a full glass. On a number of occasions, Kerry Scott, who had become suspicious of the offender, followed him into the room and found him leaning over the back of a couch that the victim and the offender’s step-daughter were lying on.13 On one of these occasions, the offender was leaning over the couch where the girls were lying. Scott noticed that both children had their tops pulled up at least halfway along their stomachs, exposing their navels. The offender was touching and tickling his step daughter on the stomach, whilst they were asleep. When the offender noticed Scott, he stated ‘they are so cute and innocent whilst they’re lying there, so peaceful sleeping’. Scott asked the offender to return to their pool game.14 Sometime after midnight, the offender went back into the sunroom where the victim was sleeping on the couch. Other children were asleep on the other couch in the room. The offender sat on one end of the couch, moved the victim’s legs as he sat beside her and pulled her skirt up to her waist.15 The offender proceeded to perform cunnilingus on the victim by pushing her legs apart with one hand, pulling her underpants to one side, placing his tongue on her vagina, licking her and then inserting his tongue inside the victim’s vagina. This went on for what the victim describes as a ‘long time’ (count one).16 The offender then inserted his finger into the victim’s vagina and, in her terms, ‘pushed really hard down’. The offender inserted his finger ‘deep down….. the whole way down’ to a depth demonstrated by the victim to be between 3-4 centimetres. The offender pushed ‘more than once…. Maybe nine times’. The victim believed that the offender was trying to spread his spit further around her vagina (count two). The offender eventually ceased and left the room.17 Upon returning home the following day, the victim disclosed that the offender had ‘licked my fanny’ to her mother after being asked about her night. The police were subsequently contacted. Shortly after the incident Detectives from Port Macquarie Child Protection Team interviewed the victim who made full and clear disclosures regarding the assaults.18 The victim was taken for a Sexual Assault Investigation Kit (SAIK) at Port Macquarie Base Hospital where some abrasions to her vagina, consistent with the assaults, were noted.19 By prior arrangement at 4pm on 20 February 2007 the offender attended Chatswood Police Station. The offender was arrested, cautioned and taken to the Custody Officer where he was informed of his rights under Part 9 of the Law Enforecement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA).20 The offender was offered the opportunity of an interview but declined upon legal advice. He agreed to provide a voluntary DNA sample. He was then charged.Victim Impact Statement21 The Crown also tendered a victim impact statement marked exhibit S5.22 A hand-written page from the victim (aged 6) was attached.23 The victim impact stated: 
     
      
      “I don’t like the man. I don’t like talking about it. It makes my tummy hurt and it feels icky. It takes a long time to feel better. I feel worried that the man will come back and do it again. This makes me feel upset and scared. I worry that I will see him again. From N”. 
      
    Reports attached to a victim impact statement24 Also attached was a statement from the counsellor, Allison White, dated 12 October 2007 (marked exhibit S6). The report outlined the impact of the assault on the victim.25 The offender through his solicitor, Mr Dickens, did not object to the tender of these documents. Mr Dickens also did not seek to cross-examine the psychologist.26 The author, Ms White, spoke with the victim’s mother, Ms G, who reported a range of noticeable behavioural and emotional changes in her daughter immediately after the sexual assault.27 Ms G stated that prior to the assaults, the victim was a very independent, confident, highly social and outgoing child. She was very welcoming of any social interaction and enjoyed any social activity particularly going to friends places to play and for sleepovers.28 Ms G reported that immediately after the assaults, this all changed. Her daughter became very needy and withdrawn. She would not leave her mother’s side or accept social invitations, even invitations from friends with whom she was very familiar. She insisted on her mother walking her to the school door.29 Ms G reported that immediately after the sexual assault, the victim withdrew her involvement and connection with staff and residents of the nursing home where her great grandmother resided. Prior to the assaults, she had been part of the team there and assisted with activities and chores. There was an incident at the nursing home where the victim grabbed her mother’s arm and pointed out that a staff member looked ‘just like him’ (meaning, the offender). She apparently knew that it was not him but indicated that it looked just like him and that it scared her. From that day on, the victim would refuse to go to the nursing home unless she had a friend she could play out in the garden with.30 The victim indicated that it takes her a long time to not ‘feel yucky in the tummy’ when she thinks about Mr Kite or talks about the offences. She has said she does not want to see Mr Kite ever again.31 Ms G also reported that another immediate impact of the sexual assault was the dramatic change in the way the victim interacted with men. She has become more aggressive towards males and has even verbally threatened to physically harm male friends. Ms G stated that the victim did not behave in this way before the offences.32 Ms G also reported that, prior to the offences, the victim would go on weekly outings with a male family friend to get ice cream, but that she refused to go without her mother since the offence.33 The victim has since relocated from Port Macquarie to Goulburn, where they have access to much-needed positive family support. However, the move meant that the victim has had to go to a new school, establish new relationships with teachers, make new friends, re-establish her home, routine and lifestyle as a direct result of the offences.34 As a result of the move the victim’s school performance and her ability to concentrate declined.35 Other behavioural changes as identified by her mother include angry outbursts (particularly when discussion the sexual assault, the court hearings, or Mr Kite), reduction in academic achievements and disconnection from previously connected paternal extended family members.36 Ms White has indicated that it is difficult to predict what the exact long term effects will be for the victim, and that she will need further counselling and support in the future.37 In summary, a major impact has been changes in the victim’s social confidence and her sense of personal safety within both her immediate and wider community.Pre-sentence report38 A pre-sentence report of Jillian Dawe dated 27 September 2007 was tendered by the Crown (exhibit S7). Family history39 That report refers to the offender’s family history. Mr Kite was born and raised in New Zealand and he described an unsettled and unhappy childhood. His mother was married on four occasions and with the exception of the last marriage, all partners were violent and abusive either towards the offender or his mother. When Mr Kite was a baby he was placed in foster care until the age of two when he was returned to his mother, who was an alcoholic until he was approximately three years of age when she became a member of the Bahai faith.40 Mr Kite states that her religious views and beliefs were strongly imposed on the family and as he aged he did not accept this faith and rebelled against her and his numerous step-fathers. Mr Kite indicated that the discipline in the family was strict, but that he has a more positive relationship with his mother in recent years. He notes that there was never really a connection with his biological father.41 In 2000 Mr Kite travelled to Australia and for approximately four years was in a relationship with his most recent partner. She had a baby from a previous relationship and Mr Kite was actively involved in parenting the daughter who is now six years of age.42 The couple have a son who is one year old. Mr Kite stated that the relationship with his previous partner is now over and he struggles to maintain contact with his son as he is not permitted to see him when the six year old step-daughter is home.43 Mr Kite’s ex-partner informed the Probation and Parole Service that, even though the offender drank to excess on occasions, his alcohol intake did not impact negatively on their relationship. She stated she was ‘shocked’ by his involvement in the offences before the Court and she added that there had never been any indication of inappropriate behaviour towards the children in their family life. She added that whilst she would allow Mr Kite to maintain contact with her daughter, the father of the daughter will no longer permit him to see her.  44 Mr Kite’s ex partner also indicated that the relationship had been positive and the couple had been considering having another child. She said there were issues with the offender’s regular viewing of pornography but that the images were of adults, not children. She spoke of her sadness about the breakdown of the family unit and the negative impact that reduced contact may have upon her son.45 Mr Kite stated that at the time of the sentencing proceedings he resided with a long term friend who was aware of his offending behaviour and who offered him considerable support.46 The report also referred to Mr Kite’s education and employment. He was educated to a year 11 standard. He had been employed in three retail positions each of approximately seven years.Factors relating to the offending47 Mr Kite was open and candid with the Probation and Parole Service in discussing his feelings of guilt for the thoughts and visual images that he experiences. He disclosed an awareness and acceptance of responsibility for his actions and a willingness to accept professional assistance to help him understand his behaviour. Mr Kite spoke of the limitations that he places on his lifestlye to ensure that he does not act inappropriately on the thoughts he experiences. He displayed considerable insight and control over his behaviour for a number of years that was lost on the evening of the offences. He sought professional assistance following this offence but he did not believe that this assistance clarified his thoughts.Drug and alcohol issues48 Mr Kite described a social use of alcohol which was excessive on occasions. He has not consumed alcohol since three days after the offence. Since he has resumed faith in the Bahai religion, Mr Kite felt confident that he would no longer consume drugs or alcohol.Attitude to the offences49 The report states that Mr Kite agreed with the facts tendered. He estimated that on the night of the offences he had consumed over a bottle of spirits coupled with beer. He tended to minimise the impact of his drinking as he did not wish to try and excuse his behaviour. He stated that whilst there are times in the evening that he does not recall, he did remember most of the details of his offending behaviour. 50 Mr Kite spoke of his attempts throughout the evening to place controls on his thoughts. He stated that he left the swimming pool earlier in the day as he did not want to remain in an environment of close physical contact with the victim and later in the evening he ceased playing in the house with the children. 51 Mr Kite informed the Probation and Parole Service that he believed he lost control after consuming such a large amount of alcohol. He expressed feelings of guilt and shame about his behaviour and he stated that, in the days immediately following the offences, he felt disbelief and bewilderment as he was unaware of the details of his behaviour.52 The report indicates that the offender is unsuitable for a community service order and is ineligible for periodic detention.53 The offender has been assessed as suitable for a high level of intervention by the probation and parole service.Psychological report54 The offender tendered a psychological report of W. John Taylor dated 30 November 2007 (exhibit S8).55 Mr Taylor’s report states that, with regard to his emotional health in the past, Mr Kite feels that he was significantly affected by the abuse and neglect he suffered when he was young. He said that he was eneuretic until his late teenager years. During the years which he was wetting the bed both he and his mattress were taken into the backyard and hosed down.56 He had been verbally and physically abused by his step-father. When discussing this he became very emotional and said “I have obviously got intimacy issues”. He is not aware of having become depressed or anxious when he was a child and said that he has not received any treatment.Rehabilitation57 The offender reported that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous for most of 2007. He has ceased going to A.A. because “I don’t believe I am an addicted drinker – I have behaviour issues with alcohol”.Sexual development58 Mr Kite said that he never had fantasied of sexual activity with children. He had fantasised about girls between about the ages of 15 and 18 years and his fantasies involved girls who were scantily clad rather than being naked. He said “it’s very image related – something that is naked is more threatening”.59 He said that he has always felt sexually inadequate and stated that “I’ve never felt sexually competent – one of the major issues with my partner was that she was very sexually demanding”.Criminal offences60 Mr Kite told the psychiatrist that he doesn’t know when he had formed the intention to commit the offences. He said “I spent a lot of time in that room – I was probably contemplating on various occasions – I don’t know”.  He said that “when she arrived that night I was aware of the potential situation”. He said that the victim “was climbing all over me in the pool wearing just her underpants soaking wet – that’s when my awareness of the physical form became apparent”. When he was playing cards he became aware that the victim was “sitting with her skirt bunched up around her waist – that was another stimulus – my focus was drawn there’. He can’t recall what he was thinking that led up to the offences occurring but that he probably was thinking about the victim.61 He stated that he now regrets his offending behaviour. With regard to this he said “I hate to think how this has affected her – I hate to think I have caused anybody to have to go through this”.Recidivism62 He reported that he had voluntarily undertaken psychiatric treatment. However, the psychiatrist whom he consulted retired after 5 or 6 sessions with him. He stated that he needs to have extensive psychological/psychiatric treatment to overcome his sexual psychopathology. He does not appear to have pursued this extensively, if at all. He enquired about the CUBIT program in jail and stated that he wants to complete the program. Diagnosis63 The diagnosis by Mr Taylor of Mr Kite was one of paedophilia. This is of the non-exclusive type as Mr Kite’s primary sexual fantasies are for girls between the ages of 15 and 18 years whereas in the exclusive type there is a preference for only prepubescent children. His preference is for girls rather than for boys.64 Mr Taylor also expressed the opinion that the offender has a passive-avoidant personality adjustment and suffers from moderate depression.Potential for recidivism65 The results of actuarial and clinical measures indicate that Mr Kite has a low to moderate risk of recidivism.66 His score of +11 on the SIR–R1 indicates a low risk of general recidivism. This score is within the 1st of 5 categories for this measure and among offenders whose score is within this category more than 80% do not commit an indictable offence within 3 years.Opinion67 Mr Kite presented to Mr Taylor as being a person of about average intellectual ability. This is consistent with the history he gave regarding his level of educational achievement. He appears to have achieved some stability in his adult life in that he is currently in the position of being an assistant manager and has had his present employment for the last 7 years.68 He is assessed as having a low to moderate risk of general recidivism. His risk of sexual recidivism is considered to be low-moderate. These opinions are based on actuarial analyses and clinical judgment. His greatest risk factors concern his sexual psychopathology involving voyeurism and paedophilia. He has normally been able to control his sexual urges and limit them to voyeurism. When heavily intoxicated with alcohol his controls were very significantly weakened resulting in paedophilic activity. He has some insight regarding his inappropriate sexual adjustment and behaviour and stated that he voluntarily attempted to undertake treatment for this. Religious involvement/support69 Mr Kite indicated that following his involvement in the offences before the Court he sought understanding and support from the Bahai faith. He felt that his return to the faith after such a long absence is the positive aspect that has resulted from his offending behaviour. He stated that he is involved in a Bahai study group weekly and he is endeavouring to fully understand the religion. It seemed that this spiritual connection provides support and guidance for Mr Kite.70 A bundle of letters to, and from, the Bahai Warringah Assembly were also tendered on behalf of the offender. Those indicated that all relevant court documents have been forwarded to the Assembly, and that Mr Kite has participated in refresher courses in the Bahai faith. The Bahai Assembly have sanctioned the offender and removed Mr Kite’s voting and administrative rights, which were published in the community gazette.71 However, I do not regard this consequence as of great significance in this case. The offender, while brought up in the Baha’i faith by his mother, had not had much to do with that faith nor its various assemblies for, it would seem, a period of about 20 years. His association with the faith, it seems, has recommenced after the incident. Since that time the letters make it clear that he has been either excommunicated or withdrawn from by the assembly and that that will continue for a period of three years after the cessation of his imprisonment.72 The discipline that he has received from the faith for the offences can only be described as minimal as far as the wider community is concerned. Those consequences consist of a disentitlement to attend community meetings, to vote at elections and to participate in a Baha’i wedding - which is not likely to be a relevant consideration for some time. In any case, these rights cannot be regarded as having been lost as a result of the offending behaviour as he did not hold them prior to the offences. Extra curial punishment 73 The offender submits that the fact that he has been required to move out of the family home, has been able to have only limited contact with his son and has been disciplined by the Baha’i faith should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. The Crown asserts that these factors are not of the kind that could be described as ‘extra curial punishment’ and that would result in any special leniency. 74 As was noted in R v KNL [2005] NSWCCA 260 by Latham J (at 49), the cases that have thus far considered the notion of extra curial punishment have been ‘restricted to physical and/or financial penalties sustained by offenders, or loss of employment in which the offender was engaged or qualified to be engaged, arising out of the commission of the offence. (See generally R v Daetz: R v Wilson [2003] NSWCCA 216)’. The remark by Kirby J in MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271 at 48 (referred to the in the offender’s submission at paragraph 21) that the applicant in that case ‘will now not see his children’ does not include any reference to extra curial punishment resulting in any particular leniency and appears to be a more general consideration of the applicant’s subjective circumstances. Such an approach is consistent with that taken by the Criminal Court of Appeal to the effect of imprisonment on an offender’s children in R v Girard, Andrew John, R v Girard Tessa Maree [2004] NSWCCA 170. 75 The Crown submits that the principle applied in R v Girard should be followed in this case when considering the fact that the offender had limited contact (every second weekend) with his son prior to going into custody and that he has moved out of the family home. That is, these factors are relevant as part of the general mix of subjective matters but they should not be taken into account as a ‘specific and particular matter resulting in a substantial reduction or elimination of a sentence of imprisonment’ (per Hodgson JA, R v Girard at 21). 76 In those circumstances there seems to be little weight that I can attribute to that connection in terms of rehabilitation. Further, the impact of his excommunication/ withdrawal from the Assembly seems to be of little relevance in terms of any extra-curial punishment.Evidence by the offender77 The offender gave evidence on 6 December 2007. He stated that he was then the Assistant Manager of a hardware store in Brookvale. He acknowledged the agreed facts and their accuracy as well as the matters contained in Mr Taylor’s report and the pre-sentence report.78 He said that he had started drinking early on the day of the incident. Initially he had started on drinking beer and had probably had a bottle of bourbon by the end of the evening. He said he didn’t recollect very much and was “pretty hammered”.79 He has since stopped drinking, his last drink being on 2 January 2007.80 He had read the victim impact statement and the report of the counsellor. He did not disagree with the matters set out in those documents. He reiterated his sorrow and desire that if he could he would “like to take it back”.81 Mr Kite also indicated his preparedness to attend the CUBIT (sex offenders) course.82 He said that, following the incident, his relationship with his then partner and her six year old daughter had been severed. He has a son aged 14 months and he sees him on a fortnightly basis and on other rare occasions.83 In cross-examination he said that he had become aware, particularly in the preceding twelve months, of his attraction to younger girls. Prior to that time his association was on visual matters. He had not let himself see children in that way, nor let himself become close to children. On one occasion he had been in a relationship where his then partner had an 11 year old daughter. He had taken steps to ensure that he was not in regular contact with her.84 He admitted in relation to the offence that he did go to the room where the children were on a number of occasions but said that it was a main thoroughfare area. He also agreed that he made up stories to go and see the children.85 Mr Kite said that he had seen a psychiatrist some time after the offences to get help. He said that although he did present as an intelligent individual that he regarded himself as “an emotional cripple”.86 The psychiatrist he has seen, Dr John Perrika, had retired. He had not sought any referral to any other psychiatrists, apparently because it had been a drain on his resources.87 He said that he had not seen himself as being a paedophile earlier and thought he had control over himself in that regard.88 He also indicated that he had had difficulties in relationships and had had at least three de facto relationships in the past. He said that his present employers will give him a job on his release from gaol.Other evidence89 Mr Alan Perkins also gave evidence on the sentence proceedings on 6 December 2007. Mr Perkins was the chairman of the Warringah Bahai Community. He said that he had been directed by the community not to provide a reference for Mr Kite but did so in a personal capacity. 90 Mr Perkins had had contact with Mr Kite during the year 2007. He said that his judgment was that Mr Kite was extremely ashamed and contrite about what he had done. It was a matter that the Assembly found difficult to cope with. The community also had real difficulties with Mr Kite’s consumption of drugs and alcohol which were prohibited under the Assembly rules and conventions. He confirmed the sanctions imposed on Mr Kite by the community in terms of exclusion.91 In cross-examination he confirmed that, prior to the offence, Mr Kite had not practised in the Bahai faith.92 Mr Graham Bowker also gave evidence on the sentence proceedings on 6 December 2007. Mr Bowker was a school teacher who had known the offender for five years. He had read the agreed facts and the victim impact statement. He had been living with Mr Kite as a flatmate during 2007 following Mr Kite’s separation from his partner.93 He was aware that, prior to the offence, alcohol had played a big part in Mr Kite’s life and that now, from his observation, Mr Kite had completely abstained from the consumption of alcohol.Submissions94 The solicitor for the offender, Mr Dickens, filed written submissions (Exhibit S10 & S12). The essence of his oral submissions were that this was not a case of planning or premeditation nor a case where the offender had groomed his victim nor where there had been a breach of trust. While it was accepted that there was a breach of trust given that the offender was an adult figure in a family setting, there was no other breach of trust involved.95 Mr Dickens submitted that the material tendered by the Crown in relation to the victim did not set out material which would go beyond that which would normally be suffered by any person involved with an offence of this nature – see R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412 per Hidden J. 
    Section 21A factorsAggravating factors96 Some of the aggravating factors relevant to a case of child sexual assault such as this as referred to in s 21A(2) of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act are:- S 21A(2)(g) the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence is substantial. Here, although the Victim Impact Statement and the report makes clear the impact has been significant, it is not substantial in the legal sense in which that term is used;- S 21A(2)(k) the offender abuses a position of trust or authority in relation to the victim. The circumstances here do not in my view come within the classification of a breach of trust in a strict sense. However, it needs to be noted that the offender was an adult and an invited guest in a home where the other parents and guardians were entitled to expect a degree of safety for their children. They were all concerned parents. None of them could have expected their children or any of them would have been subject to the kind of depraved and frightening conduct which took place.- S 21A(2)(l) the victim is vulnerable, for example, because the victim is very young or very old or has a disability:. That is a matter which is already taken into account as an element of the offence; and- S 21A(2)(m) the offence involves multiple victims or a series of criminal acts. That is a matter which I propose to take into account in relation to the question of accumulation of the sentences imposed for the separate offences.Mitigating factorsGood character 97 The offender’s prior good character is of less significance in child sex cases than other types of offences: R v Rhule (unrep, 25/7/95, NSWCCA).98 The offender has prior convictions in Australia and in New Zealand although not for crimes of a sexual nature and not involving periods of imprisonment.99 The Crown submits that in this case, the Court should not find that the offender was a person of prior good character. He has prior criminal convictions, albeit limited to traffic offences and two possess drug offences (New Zealand) resulting in monetary fines. He has also given evidence about his prior sexual fantasies for young girls and, most recently, children. This history indicates that a strong message needs to be sent to the offender that, if he yields to his sexual impulses, he will meet severe punishment - R v Burchell (1987) 34 ACrimR 148.  100 Despite the relatively limited nature of the offender’s prior convictions – and the date of them – I do not think that the authorities permit these factors to warrant extending any significant degree of leniency to the offender in this regard. Remorse/contrition101 The prisoner’s remorse is evident from the evidence he gave on 6 December 2007, as well as inherent in the plea of guilty.Subjective features102 The offender has had an alcohol problem for some years. He has also had the difficult family background referred to in the evidence and the associated emotional difficulties.Age of the child103 The victim in this matter was aged only 6 at the time of the offences. The age of the child is an important factor in assessing the degree of criminality. The younger the victim the more serious the criminality: T v R (1990) 47 A Crim R 29. I regard this factor as being particularly important.Objective seriousness104 A number of authorities have made clear that taking these factors into account in the context of child sexual assault offences does not contravene the rule against ‘double counting’ in s21A(2); see for example MLP v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 271; R v KNL 2005 NSWCCA 260; Shannon v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 39; Regina v JTAC [2005] NSWCCA 345; R v SMP [2005] NSWCCA 116. Consent105 There was an absence of consent. From a legal point of view, the issue of consent does not arise in the circumstances in any event. However, I note that the complainant was asleep at the time that the offender commenced sexual intercourse with her. Given this fact, and the tender age of the complainant, the only rational inference is that the offender knew that the complainant either did not give or would not be capable of giving consent. Planning106 The offender had not met the complainant before the evening on which the offences were committed. However, I think there is strength in the Crown submissions to the effect that:a. It is clear from the evidence before the Court that the offender became attracted to the complainant at the beginning of the evening, before he became well intoxicated. b. The offender gave evidence during cross-examination that he was aware that consuming alcohol would reduce his capacity to control himself and that he proceeded to drink anyway. c. Prior to committing the offences, the offender made a number of visits to the room where the complainant was sleeping with other children. On one of these occasions, the offender fabricated an excuse as to why he had to leave the pool-room where the other adults were drinking and talking. d. One of the other adults at the party considered the offender’s conduct suspicious and decided to check on him. Upon doing so, the offender was found in the room with the complainant and the complainant’s top was pulled up above her navel. The offender was asked to return to the adults by Mr Scott. e. The psychological report by Mr Taylor states that the offender said that he is unaware of when he formed the intention to commit the offences, that he spent a lot of time in the room, and that he probably contemplated it on various occasions (page 6). 107 The Crown submits that the above facts demonstrate a degree of pre-thought and planning to the offences. I agree with this submission. In my view the offences were not wholly opportunistic. Intoxication108 Related to the question of planning is that of the offender’s state of intoxication.109 Intoxication is relevant in determining the degree of deliberation involved in the commission of the offence. In some cases it may mitigate the crime because it caused the offender to act out of character: R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 467. In other cases it may aggravate the offence because of the recklessness with which the offender became intoxicated. The voluntary ingestion of alcohol or drugs by an offender, who knows he has a problem with alcohol/drugs and has a history of committing offences while intoxicated may be an aggravating factor: R v Fletcher-Jones (1994) 75 A Crim R 381; R v Sotheren [2001] NSWCCA 425. In many cases intoxication will be neither an aggravating nor mitigating circumstance: R v Gordon at 467-468; R v Wright (unrep, 28/2/1997, NSWCCA, at pp 6-7). 110 The written submissions filed on behalf of the offender imply that the offender’s state of intoxication at the time of the offence should be taken into account as a mitigating factor (para 8). The Crown submits that such an approach is not warranted in this case. 111 The offender gave evidence that he had been attracted to pre-pubescent girls in about the last 12 months prior to committing the offences. He became attracted to the complainant shortly after she arrived at the house and prior to the offender becoming well intoxicated. The offender was also well aware that he was less able to control himself when intoxicated. He proceeded to drink regardless. The facts referred to above under ‘Planning’ demonstrate a level of thought and deliberation in carrying out the offences. 112 This is therefore not a case where it can be said that there was no deliberation involved due to the offender’s state of intoxication or that the offender acted out of character because he was intoxicated. The offender was to some extent reckless in continuing to drink when he was fully aware of the risks of losing self-control and acting upon his desires. I do not think that any leniency can be extended to the offender on this account. 
    Finding as to range of criminalityNature of offence113 On the question of whether there is hierarchy of seriousness for acts that come within the purview of s 66A, in R v Davis [1999] NSWCCA 15 Wood CJ at CL said at [66] that “penile-vaginal penetration of a child is significantly more serious than many of the other forms of conduct encompassed within s 66A.” In AJP Simpson J concluded at [24]:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is not possible to create some kind of hierarchy of the seriousness of the various kinds of sexual intercourse contemplated by s 66A (and defined in s 61H). It is the facts and circumstances of each case, including the nature of the intercourse, that enables the proper evaluation of objective seriousness. While penile-vaginal penetration might be taken to be more serious than enforced fellatio, that does not mean that enforced fellatio necessarily falls somewhere below the mid point of objective seriousness. There are many instances of conduct that come within the definition of sexual intercourse that would be significantly less serious than enforced fellatio. Had his Honour considered the nature of the sexual intercourse as relevant, he must, in my view, have come to the view that enforced fellatio falls somewhere in the middle, or towards the upper end, of that scale.”  
        
       
      
    114 In this matter, the offender performed cunnilingus on the victim, followed by digital penetration. 115 Further, the agreed facts make graphic reference to the fact that on the second count the penetration was deep (‘right into the bottom of the complainant’s vagina’ and ‘deep down…..the whole way down’) and apparently for what was perceived as being for a substantial period of time. That would be a frightening and disorientating experience for any child, let alone one of these tender years.116 Assessing the criminality of the offences is a difficult exercise especially given the age of the victim, the alien and frightening nature of what occurred to a little girl and the impact on her as well as the circumstances in which the events occurred. Balanced against those matters are the facts that what occurred was an isolated incident with relatively little premeditation, over a relatively short period of time (unlike many of the abuse of trust/grooming cases which occur in this area) and with no suggestion that there were threats nor coercion nor force - other than that involved in the actual digital penetration with the genitalia of a young girl). 117 Having taken into account all the matters set out above, I find that the offences fall into the low to mid-range of criminality.Law: Sentencing on child sexual assault matters118 The abhorrence with which the community regards the sexual molestation of young children and the emphasis attached to general deterrence in sentencing offenders is reflected in the judgment in R v BJW (2000) 112 A Crim R 1, where Sheller JA stated at [20]:  
     
      
      “The maximum penalties the legislature has set for [child sexual assault] offences reflect community abhorrence of and concern about adult sexual abuse of children. General deterrence is of great importance in sentencing such offenders and especially so when the offender is in a position of trust to the victim. See the remarks of Kirby ACJ in R v Skinner (1994) 72 A Crim R 151 at 154.” 
      
    119 The case of R v Fisher (1989) 40 A Crim R 442 at 445 is also frequently cited:  
     
      
      “This court has said time and time again that sexual assaults upon young children, especially by those who stand in a position of trust to them, must be severely punished, and that those who engage in this evil conduct must go to gaol for a long period of time, not only to punish them, but also in an endeavour to deter others who might have similar inclinations.  
       
      … heavy custodial sentences are essential if the courts are to play their proper role in protecting young people from sexual attacks by adults …”  
      
    120 In R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575, the court provided specific guidance on the question of what factors are relevant to the assessment of objective seriousness for the offence of sexual intercourse with a child under ten under s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. The offence has a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The court held that the sentencing judge erred by excluding from the assessment of objective seriousness both the precise nature of the sexual intercourse and the fact that the offence was an isolated incident. Simpson J said at [27] that the fact that the offence was an isolated incident may of itself warrant departure from the standard non-parole period. Simpson J said at [25] that other appropriate areas of inquiry for establishing the objective seriousness of an offence under s 66A are: o how the offences took place;o over what period of time;o with what degree of force or coercion;o the use of threats or pressure before or after the offence to ensure the victim’s compliance with the demands made, and subsequent silence; and o any immediately apparent effect on the victim.Standard non-parole period121 Despite the fact that the standard non-parole period is not strictly applicable in this case as there was a plea of guilty, and my findings as to the kind of criminality involved, the standard non-parole period is still applicable as a benchmark. The effect of the standard non-parole period will generally be to increase the level of sentencing for offences to which it applies: R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575. Howie J said in R v AD [2005] NSWCCA 208 at [43], when dealing with a severity appeal for a s 61J offence:  
     
      
      “the judge in the present matter was obliged to have regard to the standard non-parole period of 10 years even though it was not applicable to the applicant’s case. In R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434 it was made clear that the effect of the standard non-parole period will generally be to increase the level of sentencing for offences to which it applies. If the provisions prescribe a standard non-parole period of 10 years as against a maximum penalty of 20 years, as is the case with an offence under s 61J, it follows that the head sentence must exceed half the maximum penalty for the offence notwithstanding that the offence is one of only mid-range seriousness.”  
      
    Other factors impacting on whether the standard non-parole period should not be applied: Plea of guilty and sparing the complainant of the need to give evidence122 The offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court and is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. A plea of guilty may also be a reason in itself to depart from the standard non-parole period. The maximum discount that can be applied for the utilitarian value is 25%. 123 The offender has made oral submissions that a further discount should be applied because the complainant has been spared the need to give evidence. The Criminal Court of Appeal in R v Thomson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; 115 A Crim R 104; [2000] NSWCCA 309, stated (p.412, para.121) that this aspect of the guilty plea, like remorse, overlaps to a substantial extent with other aspects of a particular case that are relevant to the sentencing task. Whether further leniency is required because of this aspect will depend upon the particular circumstances of the offence and the offender, including other evidence relating to contrition; R v Thomson,  p.412, paras.119 &122. The High Court in Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 656, also considered these benefits to be relevant to the aspect of remorse (at para.22). This is unlike the discount for the utilitarian aspect of the plea, which is given regardless of the other subjective features or the motivation of the offender: R v Thomson ( p. 412, para.122). 124 The Crown accepts that the guilty plea in this case was of benefit in avoiding the need to call the complainant to at least be available for cross-examination (given that her recorded interview would most likely have been used for her evidence in chief). However, the Crown submits that given the above comments in R v Thomson, it is not appropriate to nominate a distinct discount for this aspect of the guilty plea in addition to that for the utilitarian value. The value of this aspect of the plea should be weighed in light of other evidence concerning the offender’s contrition. 125 I agree with this submission. The offender pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity on 3 July 2007. I take that into account in relation to the prisoner’s remorse. I take into account the utilitarian value of that plea, its consequential saving of the resources of the justice and law enforcement systems, and the fact that to some extent it is indicative of a degree of contrition.126 I identify the discount applicable both for the utilitarian value of the plea and for the remorse expressed as being 25%.General deterrence 127 General deterrence is of prime importance in making the community aware of the attitude of the courts to child sexual offences: R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 148 per Hunt J at 150-151.Specific deterrence128 There is also a need to impose sentences which make it clear to the offender that if he should yield to his sexual impulses toward children that he will meet a severe punishment: R v Burchell (1987) 34 A Crim R 148 per Hunt J at 150. 
    Special circumstances129 Mr Dickens on behalf of the offender urges that I find special circumstances for the following reasons:o age of the offender;o the fact that this will be his first time in custody;o that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.130 Mr Taylor’s report states that the offender has a ‘low to moderate risk of general recidivism’ (page 11). This opinion is partly based on asserted facts that ‘Mr Kite said that he never had fantasies of sexual activity with children. He had fantasised about girls between the age of 15 and 18 years and his fantasies involved girls who were scantily clad rather than being naked’ (page 5) and ‘Mr Kite’s preference is for females and of the non-exclusive type in that most of his sexual fantasies involve past pubescent females between the ages of 15 and 18 years’ (page 11). 131 The Crown submits that the weight that should be given to this opinion needs to be considered in light of the fact that, during his evidence, the offender stated that he had had sexual fantasies about pre-pubescent children in the last 12 months prior to his offending. 132 On the evidence before me I have little confidence in the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation. I do not regard his connection with the Bahai faith to be particularly strong nor that that community will be available for his support in the near future. Nor do I see him as having the capacity to maintain enduring relationships which might be a source of support for him in the event that events such as this re-occur.133 It does seem to me important that he is subject to a long period of supervision against the background of professional help and treatment for those convicted of such offences.134 However, I agree that his age and the fact that this will be his first time in custody warrant a relatively minor alteration of the statutory ratio. Accordingly, I will make a variation to the statutory ratio of which the non-parole period bears to the head sentence to be one of 2/3. Hardship of custody for child sex offender 135 The courts have generally accepted the proposition that imprisonment is more onerous for offenders convicted of child sexual assault since they serve their sentence on protection. In the past this has involved a reduction in the sentence. More recently, the courts no longer assume that a prisoner serving his sentence on protection will find prison life more onerous than other prisoners in the general prison population. In R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [176]–[177] the court said:  
     
      
      “The fact of protection has been taken into account as a special circumstance in the case of such offenders, subject to the court being satisfied that the sentence will in fact be served in conditions which are more onerous — a circumstance that is no longer necessarily the case for all such offenders, in the light of the current arrangements which exist for their alternative accommodation and special management, which were considered in  
      R v Totten 
       [2003] NSWCCA 207,  
      R v Durocher-Yvon  
       NSWCCA 299, and  
      R v Mostyn 
       [(2004) 145 A Crim R 304].  
      
    136 In R v Mostyn, Howie J sounded a note of caution, with which I would respectfully agree, in relation to the manner in which the fact of protection should be taken into account, as follows:  
     
      
      ‘The present is another instance where a sentencing judge has presumably taken into account in favour of the offender the fact that he will serve his sentence under the harsh conditions and deprivations of protective custody, but that has not proved to be the case. It is an example of the difficulty of a sentencing court taking into account possible executive or administrative action in respect of a prisoner’s custody when predicting how a sentence will be served. …  
       
      As was recognised in  
      Totten 
      , the court is placed in a difficult position. On the one hand, the sentencer should take into account the conditions of the prisoner’s custody where it appears that they will be unduly onerous because of some matter particular to that prisoner. This requires that, at the time of sentence, the court make some prediction about the nature of the custody that will be endured by the prisoner. On the other hand, the courts should now be aware that assumptions or predictions, which have been made in the past about the nature of an offender’s custody because, for example, the offender has given assistance to the authorities, no longer hold good. But the vagaries of prison life are such that it could never be confidently assumed or predicted that a prisoner will serve the whole of his sentence in any particular type of custodial arrangement.’”  
      
    137 Here, there is no evidence which would establish that the offender will suffer particular or unusual hardship which should be taken into account on sentence.Likelihood of deportation138 The fact that the offender may be deported to New Zealand at the end of any sentence is not a matter which should be taken into account against him to lessen the non-parole period of imprisonment -R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 94 per Wood CJ at CL, said: 
     
      
      It is established principle that the fact of deportation is irrelevant as a sentencing consideration, it being a matter exclusively for the Executive Government:  
      R v Jap 
       NSWCCA 20 July 1998 and  
      R v Latumetan and Murwanto 
       [2003] NSWCCA 70. Moreover the High Court has held that a foreign national should receive the benefit of being eligible for release on parole:  
      Shrestha v R 
       (1991) 173 CLR 48 at 71 per Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ. 
      
     
     
      
      The fact that the Respondent would be or might be deported to Vietnam, was accordingly an immaterial factor in structuring a sentence in this case and error would be demonstrated if it could be established that it became a factor in determining any aspect of the sentence including the selection of an appropriate commencement date. (pars 13–14) 
      
    139 I do not have any evidence before me upon which I can base a conclusion as to whether or not the offender’s deportation would eventuate at some time in the future.Accumulation/Concurrence140 In R v Weldon [2002] NSWCCA 475; (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 Ipp JA stated at [46]–[48]:  
     
      
      “A paramount principle of the law of sentencing is that the aggregate sentence should fairly and justly reflect the total criminality of the offender’s conduct:  
      Veen v The Queen 
       (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. This principle applies in all cases, including where punishment is imposed for multiple offences. The sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence, having regard to all the circumstances of the case:  
      Hoare v The Queen 
       (1989) 167 CLR 348.  
       
      The question whether sentences are to be imposed concurrently or cumulatively must always be answered by reference primarily to these criteria.  
       
      It is not infrequent that, where the offences arise out of one criminal enterprise, concurrent sentences will be imposed — but this is not an inflexible rule:  
      Wilkins 
       (1988) 38 A Crim R 445 (per Lee CJ at CL and Carruthers J, Allen J dissenting). The practice should not be followed where wholly concurrent sentences would fail to take account of differences in conduct, the subject of punishment on each count:  
      Pearce v The Queen 
       (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 624 (see also 621 to 622).” (emphasis added)  
      
    141 Merely that the offences occurred in the course of a single extended episode does not justify the conclusion that the sentences are to be wholly concurrent: R v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 41; (2004) 144 A Crim R 180 at [50]. 142 Here there was one victim, the events took place on the one occasion at the one venue and essentially in the one episode. However, the acts involved under the separate counts involved different acts of criminality and clearly different kinds of sexual acts – clearly described differently by the victim. In those circumstances I am of the view that these sentences should be partially accumulated by six months to represent the different criminality involved with the acts relevant to each count. 
    JIRS statistics143 I have considered the relevant statistics produced by the Judicial Commission for offences under this section narrowed to the fields of pleas of guilty, offender with no priors. Those statistics indicate a range of sentences for a group of 23 cases: Sentences vary from 30 months to 16 years; Non-parole periods varying from 12 months to 12 years.Authorities.144 I have reviewed the authorities in this area for these kinds of offences. It must be remembered that the parliament has established the standard non-parole period for this offence with the obvious intention that a clear message be given that the sentences previously imposed were too low.145 I have reviewed the following authorities including: KSF NSWCCA (unrep 10 September 1992); Boyd NSWCCA (unrep 25.7.1995); Brooker NSWCCA (unrep 21.2.1996); AJP [2004] 150 ACrimR 575; Davies NSWCCA (unrep 10.11.2005); MLP NSWCCA (unrep 6.9.2006) and the differing facts and circumstances, findings as to criminality and personal circumstances of those offenders.146 Having considered those matters, the range of sentence I am considering falls within the range suggested as being a proper exercise of my sentencing discretion. 
    Sentencing options147 The offender is ineligible for a periodic detention order and unsuitable for a community service order.148 I am of the view that the only available sentence is one of full-time imprisonment.Commencement of sentence149 The offender was remanded in custody for these offences when the matter came before me on 6 December 2007. The sentence will be backdated accordingly.SentenceOn the first count, that the offender did have sexual intercourse with person under the age of ten years:The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment to date from 6 December 2007 and to expire on 5 December 2012. The balance of the term is 3 years and 4 months to expire on 5 April 2016.On the second count, that the offender did have sexual intercourse with person under the age of ten years:The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years imprisonment to date from 6 June 2008 and to expire on 5 June 2013. The balance of the term is 3 years and 4 months to expire on 5 October 2016.There is a partial accumulation of 6 months imprisonment.The total effect of the sentence would be a non-parole period of five years and six months imprisonment, the balance of the term being three years four months imprisonment.The offender is sentenced to a term of more than 3 years imprisonment. It will be my recommendation that the terms of his parole should include that of the offender complying with all directions and treatment as may be recommended by the Probation and Parole Service including psychiatric treatment, as well as the usual terms and conditions of parole; further that the report of Mr Taylor accompany these remarks.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: On 7 December 2006 the applicant, Robert Kelly, was sentenced on two charges arising out of conduct committed at his former matrimonial home, in Lake Cathie. Pursuant to consent orders made in the Family Court on 16 February 2006 the property had been transferred to his wife as part of a settlement upon divorce under the Family Law Act 1975 (Cth). 
     
      
    2 The offences arose out of an incident on the evening of 19 July 2006 at approximately 8.45pm. The more serious offence involved Mr Kelly, whilst armed with a rifle, breaking and entering the dwelling house at Ernest Street, Lake Cathie and committing the serious indictable offence of intimidation, contrary to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and was subject to a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years, comprised of a non-parole period of 2 years and an additional term of 2 years. He also pleaded to a lesser charge of malicious damage to property, an offence carrying a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment under s 195(a) of the Crimes Act. On the lesser offence he received a sentence of 3 months imprisonment, to run concurrently with the longer sentence, each to commence on 20 July 2006. 
     
      
    3 The applicant’s case was that his sentence on the more serious matter was excessive and that a non-parole period of 1 year was the maximum sentence warranted in law. Such a sentence would have expired on 19 July 2007. The present application was filed on 28 August 2007. Despite the requirement of the rules that an application for leave to appeal should be filed within 3 months after the sentence (see Criminal Appeal Rules, r 3B) there was no explanation as to why it took more than 8 months in the present case to file an application for leave to appeal identifying a single ground of appeal, namely that the sentence was “manifestly excessive”. Apart from noting that the significant lapse of time did not arise within the Court, that aspect of the matter need not be addressed further. 
     
      
    The Facts4 Before turning to the incident the subject of the charges, it is convenient to note some of the preceding events. The applicant and his wife separated in 2004, for reasons which were not explained at the hearing on sentence, but appear to have involved his problems with abuse of alcohol. There was, however, no evidence of domestic violence. 
     
      
    5 A report from his general practitioner, Dr Evans, indicated that on about 28 May 2004 he had been diagnosed with abnormal liver function, caused by alcohol abuse. Dr Evans reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “His wife left him in December 2004, and following this he began drinking more heavily and was not coping. He became depressed and suicidal over the period of 19th March 2005 – 22nd May 2006 and continued to drink.” 
        
       
      
    6 According to a report from the North Coast Area Health Service he attended as an outpatient at the detoxification unit of the Port Macquarie Community Health Centre from 12 August 2005 to 12 April 2006. It appears that he then attended a final “detox” session at Wauchope District Hospital and moved to live with his mother on the south coast whilst awaiting admission to a drug and alcohol rehabilitation centre. The Port Macquarie Community Health Centre report of 30 November 2006 indicated that their last contact with him was in April 2006. 
     
      
    7 It appears that he then spent six weeks on the south coast, which Dr Evans thought was prior to his admission to Wauchope Hospital on 22 May 2006, but may have been thereafter. Doctor Evans said that she last saw him on 5 July 2006 at which stage “he claimed he had not been drinking for seven weeks and claimed he had a ‘setback’ the previous evening after seeing his wife over money issues”. The consultation on 5 July was 14 days before the incident which gave rise to the charges. 
     
      
    8 According to the facts presented by the prosecution on sentence, the applicant was on the south coast between April and July 2006. When he returned to Lake Cathie he was informed of a new relationship involving his wife and told her: “That is fair enough. That is none of my business.” The facts continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “However, for the next several days the offender kept returning to Mrs Kelly’s home wanting to talk about their relationship, with her telling him that there was nothing to talk about, as it was over. On one occasion the offender had a heated argument with Mrs Kelly and his son and was told to leave the premises.” 
        
       
      
    9 The facts also stated that the applicant met his former wife on 14 July 2006, at his request, at which time she sought to reinforce her position that their relationship was over. She changed her telephone numbers later that day, from which it may be inferred that his contacts were viewed by her as a significant nuisance. The applicant apparently visited the former matrimonial home on several occasions over the next few days. Nevertheless, despite the reference to a “heated argument” and the changing of the telephone numbers, there was nothing to suggest that Mrs Kelly feared violence from the applicant at that stage. 
     
      
    10 When the applicant arrived at the Ernest Street premises on the evening of 19 July, Mrs Kelly was at home with their 20 year old son, David, a next door neighbour, Mrs Kerry Smith, and a Mr Michael O’Donnell, whose vehicle was parked in the driveway. 
     
      
    11 At some stage on that evening (the time not being revealed by the evidence) the applicant went to a friend’s home and “asked to borrow a rifle to go shooting”. The statement of facts continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was informed by his friend, who held a firearms licence, that he only had available a .22 calibre single shot rifle, which he showed the offender how to operate, including safety mechanisms. He offered the offender a full box of bullets, but he declined, instead taking a box containing only 8 rounds.” 
        
       
      
    12 There was no evidence from the friend as to the applicant’s apparent state at the time he borrowed the rifle. The applicant did not give evidence. As will be seen, by the time he reached Ernest Street (an unknown distance from the friend’s home) he was in a state of blind fury. There is no evidence as to whether or not he had been drinking on that day, but no witness to the incident suggested that he was inebriated. Certainly there is no statement in the facts to that effect. 
     
      
    13 The events of the evening of 19 July after the applicant arrived at Ernest Street were set out in the following paragraphs of the Facts on Sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. … He proceeded to smash all the windows of Mr O’Donnell’s motor vehicle, which was parked in the driveway of Mrs Kelly’s home, and then went to the front door. Mrs Kelly answered his knock and opened the glass front door and spoke to him through the unlocked screen door. The offender asked if David was there, as he wished to speak to him. Mrs Kelly told the offender she would go and ask David if he wished to talk to him, and saw that he had a rifle, which he pointed at her. The offender opened the screen door and Mrs Kelly screamed, jumped back, slammed the front door and locked it. Mrs Kelly rang 000 and screamed out to the other occupants of the house, ‘He’s got a gun’. The offender then began kicking the door, but was not enable [sic] to gain entry. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The next door neighbour, Allan Smith, had approached the offender and said, ‘What are you doing?’ The offender said, ‘I’ve got no problem with you’. Mr Smith said, ‘Don’t be stupid’. The offender said, ‘Go away’, and continued to bash the door with the butt of the rifle. Mr Smith said, ‘Let me get my wife out’. The offender said, ‘Yeah I know Kerry’s in there. I don’t want to hurt her’. Mr Smith said, ‘Now piss off and get out of here’. The offender then smashed the glass sliding window of the living/dining room with the butt of the rifle, and pushed the barrel through waving it into the room. He pointed it at David Kelly who, terrified he may be shot, called out to the offender, ‘Dad, it’s me, don’t shoot’. The offender moved the barrel away from him but continued to search the immediate area of the room with the rifle. Mrs Kelly screamed from her position for those inside the house to get out. Mrs Smith was screaming for Mr Smith to get her. David Kelly, Mr O’Donnell and Mrs Smith left the house by the rear glass sliding door in to the backyard. Mr Smith ran to the side of the house where Mr O’Donnell assisted him to lift Mrs Smith over the dividing fence. Mr Kelly and Mr O’Donnell also jumped the fence and went inside the Smith’s home. Mr Smith had to pacify Mrs Smith, as she was extremely shaken. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The offender then returned to the front door and smashed the glass panel at the side of it with the rifle butt, reached in and unlocked it. He then entered the house, went to the kitchen where Mrs Kelly was on the phone, and pointed the rifle at her face. Mrs Kelly said, ‘Bob, please don’t’, and could see the offender was in an enraged state. She pushed the barrel away from her face on two occasions and the offender ripped the phone from the wall. He then walked towards the rear sliding door and Mrs Kelly ran into the next door neighbour’s house and hid. The offender then went to those premises where he was met by Mr Smith at the front door, who said to him, ‘Don’t touch anything on my house’. The offender said, ‘I’ve got no problem with you’. Mr Smith said, ‘Just piss off and go’. The offender went back into Mrs Kelly’s home for a short time and then drove away in his motor vehicle. About 5 minutes later he drove past the house and again drove away.” 
        
       
      
    14 The Statement of Facts further noted that the applicant had returned the rifle to his friend, apparently that evening. Again nothing was said about his state, other than that there was blood on the stock and he had a rag wrapped around his right hand. The rifle had apparently been damaged in the assault on the car or the front door, with the result that the rear of the bolt had been bent and the firing mechanism jammed.  
     
      
    15 Curiously, the facts stated that the friend had “noted that the bolt was closed and pulled back to the rear”, but did not indicate whether there was a round in the breech. Nor was there any evidence as to whether the other rounds were returned. It is difficult to believe that the police would not have sought to determine if the gun were loaded when it was returned. It is difficult to understand why the Court was invited by the Director of Public Prosecutions to sentence the applicant without information in that regard. 
     
      
    16 On 22 September 2006, the applicant saw a Mr John Nolan, psychologist, in Port Macquarie. He apparently told Mr Nolan that he “had no memory of the event and that he is still confused over what he was said to have done”. Whether he in fact had no memory, or did not wish to discuss the events with the psychologist, is not known. A number of these matters could have been clarified, no doubt, by the applicant, had he given evidence: he did not do so. 
     
      
    17 Statements were obtained from eight residents of Lake Cathie who knew Mr Kelly, and from his daughter and his sister. Apart from the members of his family, only one of the friends referred to his drinking. None suggested that he had no memory of the events and several suggested that he had given them some explanation and indicated remorse. He also indicated remorse to the psychologist. 
     
      
    18 There were references in a letter written by his sister (though not in that of his daughter) to a history of accidents some of which involved head injuries. Mr Nolan (psychologist) also referred to an account of a head injury in 1999 and to the possibility of “cognitive deficits”, for a person who had been “drinking alcohol at levels similar to Mr Kelly”. However the latter appears to have been speculative: Mr Nolan spoke with Mr Kelly for one hour in the cells at Port Macquarie Court House on 22 September 2006 and noted in his report that he had not had the opportunity to interview him in depth or conduct any psychometric or other tests. Doctor Evans noted that she had “no documentation with respect to a head injury or headaches”. Accordingly, it was appropriate for the trial judge to sentence him on the basis of normal cognitive capacity. 
     
      
    The Sentencing19 In imposing a sentence of 4 years imprisonment with a 2 year non-parole period for the charge of breaking and entering a dwelling house and of intimidation, Garling DCJ noted that the offence carried a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. The standard non-parole period did not apply on a plea of guilty, which had been entered at the earliest opportunity. However, his Honour also held that the case did not fall into “the mid-range category of seriousness of these types of offences”. That was because his Honour had concluded that there was not “the slightest evidence before me he was going to do anything more than terrify these people”. It may be added that the offence covers an extensive range of offences, described as “serious indictable offences”, being any indictable offence punishable by imprisonment for life or for more than 5 years: Crimes Act, s 4. Intimidation was but one example. 
     
      
    20 The finding that the applicant intended only to intimidate was open and, no doubt, appropriate in the circumstances. Nevertheless, the fact that he took eight rounds of ammunition might have suggested that he went to the house having given himself the means by which he could at least discharge the rifle. It may be accepted that the gun was not loaded, a matter about which his Honour made no express finding, but was the basis on which he proceeded to sentence.  
     
      
    21 His Honour also made no finding as to the applicant’s state of mind at the time of the incident. Whether through anger or alcohol, a matter about which there was no evidence, his conduct sufficiently demonstrated that he was in a violent and angry state of mind. (Mrs Kelly described him as being “in an enraged state”.) 
     
      
    22 His Honour described the combination of the event and the character of the prisoner as “amazing” and “incredible”. It might more aptly have been described as saddening. The applicant was a 50 year-old man, with no relevant prior criminal record and was a person who was apparently well thought of in the community. The medical evidence demonstrated that he had a problem with alcohol abuse, which may have caused the breakdown of his marriage. A combination of alcohol abuse and anger is not unknown. 
     
      
    23 The evidence in the letter from Dr Evans suggests that he had had some success in overcoming his alcohol problem, prior to living for six weeks on the south coast, but had had a relapse after returning to Lake Cathie. That must have been during the period, some days before the incident, when he contacted his former wife on a number of occasions. The inference may be drawn that the break-up of his marriage was for him still an unresolved tragedy in his life. 
     
      
    24 The difficulty for the trial judge was that he had no evidence before him as to the applicant’s explanation for the events of the evening, nor any evidence that the applicant had insight into the causes of his behaviour. His Honour stated (p 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is imperative that the prisoner successfully resolve his heavy, uncontrolled drinking behaviour but he has a good prognosis for recovery if he receives treatment for the depression and alcohol abuse. He does not have a history of violence or aggression. He has had a series of relationship and family stresses. He suffered depression. However, he should be able to be rehabilitated from his alcohol problems.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour also took the view that his expressions of remorse were based on the fact that “he still cared for his wife”. No doubt he did: however, there were also undoubtedly other feelings involved. His Honour, correctly, noted that general deterrence was a significant consideration in sentencing for conduct of this kind: Judgment, p 6. He also placed weight upon the element of personal deterrence, stating (p 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “Giving an opinion on the risk of re-offending [Mr Nolan] would rate it as low to medium based on the information currently available. It would be low if he abstained from drinking, however, if he did not, he could very well offend again.” 
        
       
       
      The sentence imposed was expressed as intended, in part, to bring home to the applicant the seriousness of his offence and the need to take effective control of his alcohol problem: p 7. 
       
      
    26 The trial judge found there were special circumstances warranting a longer period on parole than the standard statutory proportion of the non-parole period. 
     
      
    The application for leave to appeal27 The last-mentioned aspect of the sentencing was clearly correct and was not challenged. Nor did Ms Francis, who appeared for the applicant, suggest that a custodial sentence was inappropriate. Rather, she contended that a non-parole period of two years was excessive in all the circumstances. 
     
      
    28 Counsel argued that the proper approach to be adopted by the sentencing judge was one based upon “the principle of parsimony”: see DB v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 27 at [10] (Adams J). This, counsel contended, required that the lowest available penalty, sufficiently reflecting the seriousness of the offence, was that which should be imposed. In this case, she contended, a custodial sentence involving a non-parole period of 1 year would satisfy that test and that, accordingly, a non-parole period of 2 years was excessive. This approach was said to be consistent with, if not required by, s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    29 Where, as was conceded, there was no patent error in the approach adopted by the primary judge, the means by which an excessive sentence was to be identified becomes important. The argument appears to be that unless the lowest appropriate sentence is passed, the sentence passed will be one which is not warranted in law and therefore should not have been passed, engaging the obligation of the Court to quash the sentence and pass another sentence in substitution, satisfying those requirements of the law. 
     
      
    30 To suggest that there will not be, almost inevitably, a range of sentences which could appropriately be characterised as “warranted in law” is to misunderstand his Honour’s judgment; Adams J expressly stated the contrary in the balance of [10] through to [12]. If the “principle of parsimony” is taken to imply that there cannot be such a range, that language should be abandoned. Indeed, “parsimony” is a slightly curious word to use in this context, albeit it has, as his Honour noted, a respectable lineage in Victoria. In the South Australian case to which Adams J referred, Webb v O’Sullivan [1952] SASR 65 at 66, Napier CJ, in dealing with a traffic offence, had merely stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Our first concern is the protection of the public, but, subject to that, the court should lean towards mercy. We ought not to award the maximum which the offence will warrant, but rather the minimum which is consistent with a due regard for the public interest.” 
        
       
      
    31 In this case, the applicant needed to demonstrate that, absent any identifiable error, the sentence imposed was excessive in the sense of being above the legitimate range of sentences which might have been thought appropriate in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion, in accordance with the principles established in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505. As explained in the joint judgment in that case, by reference to English authority, “the court will not interfere because its members would have given a less sentence, but only if the sentence appealed from is manifestly wrong” and the court “only interferes on matters of principle and on the ground of substantial miscarriage of justice”. 
     
      
    32 One of the specific matters relied on for the applicant was that the applicant made no verbal threats that he was going to use the weapon or that he would hurt anyone. However, it may be doubted that the intimidation was any less for that reason. On occasion, verbal threats may be seen as bluster, while violent behaviour by a man perceived to have a loaded gun in a residential home, without any demand, explanation or verbal threat, may appear highly intimidating. The apprehension of danger to human life of an angry man with a gun in a residential home, pointing the gun directly at and searching for people in the house, is not something to be lightly dismissed. A person having no clear knowledge of the applicant’s intention, but a realistic perception that he might use the gun in anger, might easily have sought to intervene to disarm him. The possibility of some person being injured or killed must fall within the range of likely perceptions. 
     
      
    33 The applicant also relied upon the favourable finding that the applicant was not doing anything “more than terrify these people”. For reasons already given, that should not be seen as warranting greater leniency than has already been accorded to the applicant. 
     
      
    34 The applicant noted that there was “no evidence that the gun was loaded and there was no evidence of any attempt to fire the weapon for the purpose of mere intimidation”. These facts may be accepted, but they do not diminish the seriousness of the conduct in a way which would provide any warrant for this Court to interfere with the sentence imposed. Counsel produced no authority which would support the imposition of a lesser sentence in this case. 
     
      
    35 Finally, the applicant relied upon the subjective circumstances to which reference has already been made. Most important in this regard was the absence of any history of aggression. Counsel described the incident as the conduct of a man “who was undoubtedly genuinely attempting to address his ill-health”. In the sense that he had sought to address his alcohol abuse problems prior to the event which gave rise to the charges, that statement may be accepted. However, the report of the psychologist, conducted in the cells over a period of one hour, was the limit of the evidence before the trial judge as to the steps taken or proposed to be taken following his arrest. The absence of any further medical evidence or indeed evidence from the applicant himself, permitted the Court to draw no inference as to the degree of insight into his problems and therefore the likelihood of success in overcoming his difficulties. However, his Honour was conscious of these facts and gave them weight in his reasons for sentencing.  
     
      
    36 The applicant has failed to establish error in the sentencing process; it is impossible to say that the sentence in fact imposed was excessive in all the circumstances. The matter having been the subject of full argument, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal, but the appeal must be dismissed.

     DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) v Paul Geoffrey CORNWALL 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: On 14 March 2007 the Respondent was sentenced in the District Court for a number of offences which, in their aggregation, resulted in a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months, to date from 13 December 2005 with an additional term of 2 years and 4 months, giving a total sentence period of 7 years and 10 months. 
     
      
    2 On 30 April 2007 the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) filed a notice of appeal against “a sentence” pronounced in the District Court, on the sole ground that “the said sentence is manifestly inadequate”. 
     
      
    3 In written submissions filed on 28 June 2007 the Director sought to challenge not merely the individual sentences imposed for particular offences, but also the manner in which the trial judge had structured the sentences. The Respondent took exception to the apparent expansion of the basis of complaint from manifest inadequacy of a “sentence”, to the manner in which the various sentences were or were not accumulated, giving rise to the overall structure of the aggregated sentence period. 
     
      
    4 The period of approximately 6 weeks taken to file the notice of appeal was not, in the circumstances, excessive, but there is some cause for complaint in the sense that the notice provided no real indication of the manner in which it was said that the sentencing exercise had miscarried. There was, in effect, a period of 3 and a half months before the Respondent was given full notice of the extent of the challenge. However, because the notice of appeal identified the starting dates of each sentence, and referred to the manifest inadequacy of “the said sentence” it might reasonably be inferred that the Director sought to challenge the manner in which the aggregate period was structured. 
     
      
    5 In Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299 the joint judgment of the High Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “An appeal by the Crown against sentence has long been accepted in this country as cutting across the time-honoured concepts of criminal administration by putting in jeopardy for the second time the freedom beyond the sentence imposed.” 
        
       
      
    6 Caution must be exercised in relying upon the reasoning in Everett in considering the operation of s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Pursuant to the Criminal Code (Tas) under consideration in that case, the right of appeal against sentence given to the Attorney-General was available only with leave of the Court. 
     
      
    7 Although no leave is required by the Director in the present case, it has long since been established that the power of the Court to intervene is no less constrained than in relation to an appeal by the person subject to the sentence: see Whittaker v The King (1928) 41 CLR 230 at 238 (Isaacs J). Rather, it has been said that this Court “has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown, and in deciding whether to exercise that discretion, it should have regard to the double jeopardy that a convicted person faces as a result of a Crown appeal”: R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70](d) (Wood CJ at CL, Meagher JA and Bell J agreeing). Even where the Court decides to intervene, the same principle of restraint is reflected in the fact that the Court “ordinarily gives recognition to the element of double jeopardy involved (in twice standing for sentence) by imposing a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance”: see Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562 (Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J); see also R v Holder and Johnston [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 256C (Street CJ, O’Brien CJ of Cr D agreeing) and Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [62] (Kirby J). 
     
      
    8 There are, however, other principles to be considered. As explained by McHugh J in Everett (p 306): 
     
      
       
        
        “The jurisdiction to hear a Crown appeal against sentence is conferred on a court of criminal appeal so that that court can ensure that, so far as the subject matter permits, there will be uniformity of sentencing. Uniformity of sentencing is a matter of great importance in maintaining confidence in the administration of justice in any jurisdiction. Sentences that are higher than usual create justifiable grievances in those who receive them. But inadequate sentences also give rise to a sense of injustice, not only in those who are the victims of the crimes in question but also in the general public. Inadequate sentences are also likely to undermine public confidence in the ability of the courts to play their part in deterring the commission of crimes.” 
        
       
       
      To this, his Honour might have added that others sentenced more severely for similar offences may (absent unusual altruism) also feel a sense of grievance against the beneficiary of the manifestly inadequate sentence. 
       
      
    9 Although it is common to speak of sentencing on a prosecution appeal at “the lower end of the range” that is a concept of no great precision. It may be understood to identify the lowest sentence which, if imposed by the trial judge, would have withstood intervention on appeal. On the other hand, that approach involves a level of uncertainty in that the court will not intervene to “tinker” with a sentence and may not intervene for discretionary reasons not entirely related to the range of appropriate sentences. There is an additional qualification in that a sentencing judge should always seek to impose the lowest appropriate sentence consistent with proper sentencing principles and the circumstances of the case. In addition, the appeal court is unlikely to be as conversant as the trial judge with all of the circumstances, especially where sentence was imposed after a trial, or even in a case where oral evidence has been given on sentence: see Isaacs J in Whittaker at 248-250. 
     
      
    10 In the present case, I agree with Latham J that the sentencing exercise miscarried in the ways that her Honour identifies. Both the individual sentences imposed and the aggregation of the sentences require the intervention of the Court. 
     
      
    11 Further, it can hardly be doubted that the conduct of the Respondent reveals a deliberate and serious flouting of the criminal law over a number of years. The sentences proposed by her Honour and the structure indicated would all be appropriate at trial. This Court should properly indicate its views in that regard so as to give effect to its function in maintaining uniformity of sentencing and confidence in the administration of justice. 
     
      
    12 I further agree that each of the sentences must be increased and, subject to what follows, to the extent indicated by her Honour. However, in my view the fact that the Respondent is standing to be re-sentenced, in circumstances where he had no real notice of the complaints of the Director until 3 and a half months after he was sentenced and 1 and a half years into his non-parole period, requires that a lesser aggregation of the sentence period should be achieved than would otherwise be appropriate. In three respects I would also depart from the sentences her Honour has proposed. 
     
      
    13 First, in relation to one count of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, for which he was committed for sentence, the Respondent was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months by the trial judge, which was to be wholly concurrent with a second fixed term of imprisonment for a similar offence, but for a longer period. Because, under the proposed sentencing scheme, the first sentence will remain wholly concurrent, it will not affect the overall period to be served in custody. Nevertheless, in my view the proposed increase is excessive. The offence of making a false statement in relation to his employment on a loan application form, resulting in the provision of financial accommodation by a bank, but no ultimate loss, does not in the circumstances warrant a proposed period of imprisonment of 1 year 6 months. I would not increase the sentence on that count. 
     
      
    14 The second specific sentence in relation to which I have concerns is the sentence for cultivation of a prohibited drug, namely cannabis. This was the subject of a discrete error on the part of the trial judge in failing to take into account a number of other offences. It is proposed that the fixed term sentence imposed by the trial judge of 6 months should be increased to 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years. While I accept that such a sentence would have been appropriate at trial, I do not think such a major increase in sentence is necessary or appropriate on an appeal by the Director. Nor is there any reason to vary the statutory proportion of the non-parole period and the additional term. On that matter, I would sentence the Respondent to a non-parole period of 18 months and an additional term of 6 months. 
     
      
    15 Thirdly, in relation to the most serious offence under s 86(3) of the Crimes Act (specially aggravated kidnapping), in respect of which a further charge of armed robbery with an offensive weapon was taken into account, I accept that the proposed sentence involving a 7 year non-parole period and an additional term of 4 years would have been entirely appropriate at trial. Nevertheless, the sentencing statistics in relation to s 86(3) indicate that over a period of some 5 years, in a total of 18 cases, the highest non-parole period or fixed term was 8 years and the highest sentence (out of 24 cases) was 12 years. This was a serious offence of its kind and, taking into account the further offence, I would impose a sentence of 10 years imprisonment. If the statutory proportion were to be applied, that would include a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. However, because in my view the overall non-parole period would then be excessive, taking into account the appropriate commencing dates, which will be noted below, I would find special circumstances for the purposes of s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) and increase the proportion of the additional term to approximately 54% of the non-parole period, setting the non-parole period at 6 years 6 months and the additional term at 3 years 6 months. 
     
      
    16 While it is important that an offender should generally not escape separate and effective punishment for independent acts of criminality, the accumulation of sentences for a number of separate offences may result in an aggregate sentence period which “becomes so crushing as to call for the merciful intervention of the court by way of reducing the total effect”: see King CJ in R v Rossi (SA CCA, 20 April 1988, unrep) quoted by McHugh J in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 308. That principle has a particular and potentially greater application in the case of an appeal by the Attorney or the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is so because the particular aspect of the principle of double jeopardy which is engaged has immediate effect when considering the consequences of the re-sentencing on the individual offender. 
     
      
    17 In these circumstances, accepting the structure proposed by the trial judge and adopted by Latham J, the period of imprisonment for the cultivation offence should commence on 13 December 2005. It should run for a period of 1 year before the commencement of other sentences. The two sentences for obtaining financial advantage by deception should commence on 13 December 2006. They, in turn, should run for a period of 1 year until the commencement of the most serious offence of specially aggravated kidnapping, which, together with the aggravated break, enter and steal, should commence on 13 December 2007. The non-parole period of 6 years 6 months for the most serious offence would expire on 12 June 2014, giving an aggregate non-parole of 8 years 6 months. The effective additional term would be 3 years 6 months, imposed for the specially aggravated kidnapping offence. The total sentence period would be 12 years, with the additional period expiring on 12 December 2017. 
     
      
    18 LATHAM J: This is a Crown appeal against sentences imposed upon the respondent on 14 March 2007 by her Honour Judge Quirk (the Judge) in respect of five offences. It is pertinent to note that the Notice of Appeal sought to appeal “a sentence”, yet nominated the several sentences received for the various offences and their respective commencement dates. In the course of oral submissions on the hearing of the appeal, the Crown clarified its position, in so far as it contended that the individual sentences, and the aggregate sentence, were manifestly inadequate. It would have been desirable for the Notice of Appeal to conform to the Crown’s argument in this Court. 
     
      
    19 The respondent pleaded guilty on 25 August 2006 to an indictment containing the following two charges:- 
     
      
       
      Count 1 – Specially Aggravated Detain for Advantage (s 86(3)  
      Crimes Act 
        
      1900), carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. A charge of Armed Robbery with an Offensive Weapon (s 97(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      ) was to be taken into account on a Form One. 
       
       
      Count 2 – Aggravated Break Enter and Steal (s 112(2)  
      Crimes Act 
      ), carrying a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment.  
       
      
    20 In addition, the respondent stood for sentence in respect of the following three charges upon which he had been committed for sentence on 21 July 2006:- 
     
      
       
      Counts 1 and 2 – Obtain Financial Advantage by Deception (s 178BA  
      Crimes Act 
      ) carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. 
       
       
      Count 3 – Cultivate Prohibited Drug (s 23(1)(a)  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
        
      1985) carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. A further six offences were to be taken into account on another Form One. They consisted of two counts of Obtain Financial Advantage by Deception, one count of Make False Instrument and another of Use False Instrument, and two counts under the  
      Electricity Supply Act  
      1995 relating to the unauthorised use of electricity and interference with a meter.  
      
    21 The respondent was sentenced as follows:- 
     
      
       
      Indictment Count 1 – Taking into account the offences on the Form One, a non parole period of four years, six months commencing 13 December 2006, expiring 12 June 2011, with a balance of term of two years and four months, expiring 12 October 2013. 
       
       
      Indictment Count 2 - A fixed term of imprisonment for three years, commencing 13 December 2006, expiring 12 December 2009. 
       
       
      Committal Count 1 - A fixed term of imprisonment of six months, commencing 13 June 2006, expiring 12 December 2006. 
       
       
      Committal Count 2 – A fixed term of imprisonment for 15 months, commencing 13 June 2006, expiring 12 September 2007. 
       
       
      Committal Count 3 – A fixed term of imprisonment for six months, commencing 13 December 2005, expiring 12 June 2006. 
       
      
    22 The effective aggregate non parole period was therefore one of five years and six months, with a balance of term of two years and four months. The total sentence was one of seven years and ten months. As I have already noted, the Crown maintains that the individual sentences are, and the aggregate sentence is, manifestly inadequate. The substance of the Crown’s complaint is that her Honour failed to reflect the objective gravity of the offences in the sentences she imposed, particularly given that they were aggravated by a number of factors, and that her Honour erred in making several of the offences almost wholly concurrent with each other and with the balance of the respondent’s parole. 
     
      
    The Offences23 It is pertinent to set out the offences in chronological order, given the fact that the respondent committed all of the offences, but for the Cultivate Cannabis offence, whilst subject to parole, and committed Counts 2 and 3 of the committal document whilst on bail for the offences the subject of the indictment.  
     
      
    24 On 7 October 2002, the respondent was one of three men who assaulted and robbed the bar manager of a hotel, the Adam’s Tavern at Blacktown, late at night in the victim’s home. Each of the offenders was wearing a balaclava and was armed with a weapon. The respondent brandished a tomahawk, the others a handgun and a knife. One of the co-offenders said to the victim ""We're here to do over the Tavern, co-operate with us and you won’t get hurt”. The victim was asked questions about the Tavern, its security system and access to the safe. The keys to the Tavern were taken from him, constituting the offence of Armed Robbery. This offence was the subject of one of the Form One documents. 
     
      
    25 The co-offender armed with the handgun held it to the victim's head and said to him ""Don't fuck up. Your life depends on this"". He swapped weapons with the respondent and struck the victim's head causing it to bleed. The victim's legs were tied together with a piece of rope and the co-offenders left, leaving the respondent armed with the handgun, saying to him ""If he moves or fucks up, shoot him"". Later the respondent gave the victim a towel and said ""Here, keep the pressure on it"". The respondent went to the victim's bedroom, obtained a doona or blanket and wrapped the victim in it. Over the following hours, the respondent received a number of calls from his co-offenders, informing him of their progress. This constituted the offence of Specially Aggravated Detention for Advantage. 
     
      
    26 The co-offenders went to the Tavern which had ceased trading for the day and was locked and secured. They entered the Tavern using the key obtained from the victim and disabled the security system. One of them opened the safe in the office area and removed about $21,000 in cash. This was recorded on CCTV footage. While the offence was being committed, the respondent sat with the handgun pointed at the victim. After receiving a telephone call, the respondent said to the victim ""They had a problem with the alarm but succeeded, so you don't get a bullet tonight. You’re going to have to give us at least 10 minutes, don't fuck up, we know where you live and we know your name."" After the respondent left, the victim untied his legs and telephoned a friend. A short time later an ambulance and police officers attended. The head injury inflicted upon the victim required four stitches. This constituted the offence of Aggravated Breaking, Entering and Stealing. 
     
      
    27 A DNA profile consistent with that of the respondent was identified from a cigarette butt left at the victim's home.  
     
      
    28 On 2 March 2003 the respondent made an application for finance addressed to the St George Bank Ltd in which he sought a residential loan. He stated that he was employed by a company known as ""Jomar Investments Pty Ltd"". On 2 May 2003 he was offered a loan in the amount of $250,000 which he received. He made repayments from May 2003 until December 2005 but made no repayments after 5 December 2005. The respondent was not employed by any such company. The bank took possession of the premises to which the loan related, sold them and accordingly suffered no loss. This constituted the offence of Obtaining Money by Deception, being Count 1 of the committal charges. 
     
      
    29 On 29 March 2004, the respondent voluntarily attended Blacktown police station and was arrested in relation to the offences committed on 7 October 2002. In the course of an interview the respondent made full admissions, saying that he had initially thought his role was to be that of a “cockatoo”. The respondent said that he had received $3,500 for his part in the offences. He was granted bail. 
     
      
    30 In May 2004 the respondent and his wife were joint proprietors of a vacant lot of land at Cooma. They applied to the bank for finance to enable them to erect a dwelling on it. In the application the respondent stated that he worked for Wynstan Blinds and Doors. The respondent was not so employed. On 29 August 2004, the respondent supplied to the bank a builder’s contract signed by him and his wife, which contained particulars that were false. Between that date and February 2005, the respondent made a number of progress payment applications to the bank, which were false, and received a total of $172,912. The loss to the bank was between $60,000 and $100,000. This constituted the offence of Obtaining Money by Deception, being Count 2 of the committal charges. The respondent did not build a house upon the land but built a large shed in which cannabis plants were grown.  
     
      
    31 On 16 July 2005, the respondent obtained a credit card from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia by falsely representing that he was employed by Wynstan Security Doors and Blinds. The respondent supplied false documents relating to that company. The respondent incurred a debt of approximately $6,000, which was never paid. Further, in August 2005 the respondent obtained a Mastercard from Citibank by falsely representing that he was employed by Wynstan Security Doors and Blinds. The respondent incurred a debt of approximately $14,800, which was never paid. These offences were represented on a Form One as two counts of Obtain Financial Advantage by Deception. The offences of Make and Use False Instruments on a Form One related to the fabrication and use of false pay slips in support of the credit card applications. 
     
      
    32 During the respondent’s cultivation of 57 cannabis plants in the shed on the Cooma land in mid 2005 (the subject of the Cultivate Cannabis charge, being Count 3 of the committal charges), the respondent interfered with the electricity meter to the property and obtained $2000 worth of electricity to which he was not entitled. Offences relating to this conduct appeared on a Form One. 
     
      
    33 Meanwhile, the respondent's trial for the offences committed on 7 October 2002 had been fixed for 19 September 2005. On 13 September 2005, the respondent left Australia on a flight to Fiji. On 20 October 2005, the respondent’s parole in respect of a sentence imposed on 13 December 1999 was revoked. The balance of parole of two years, nine months and eight days commenced on 13 December 2005, the day the respondent returned to Australia and was taken into custody. That sentence expires on 20 September 2008. Relevantly, the 1999 sentence was imposed for armed robbery offences.The Respondent’s Subjective Circumstances and Criminal History34 In the course of 1990, at the age of 19, the respondent committed five armed robberies in company, one assault with intent to rob whilst armed and in company, one armed robbery, one robbery, an offence of larceny motor vehicle and an offence of discharge loaded weapon with intent to prevent his lawful apprehension, all on the north coast of NSW. The respondent was not charged with these offences until 1994, when he was transferred to NSW from Queensland where he was serving sentences for four armed robberies whilst in company in that State.  
     
      
    35 Whilst awaiting committal, the respondent was granted parole on the Queensland sentences and then bail in respect of the NSW offences. Ultimately, after a number of delays, the offences came on for trial at Grafton District Court on 21 September 1998. The respondent did not appear and a bench warrant issued. The respondent was arrested on the Bench warrant in July 1999 and pleaded guilty on 15 November 1999 to the 1990 offences. The respondent was sentenced in December 1999 and was released to parole on 14 July 2002. The explanation for what appears to be an extremely light sentence (an aggregate minimum term of three years, with an additional term of one year) for such a significant number of serious offences is no doubt the extensive delay between the respondent’s first acknowledgement of guilt in January 1991 in relation to the 1990 offences and the final disposition of the matter. Thus, the instant offences were committed within three months of his release to parole. 
     
      
    36 The respondent was 36 years of age at the time of sentence. His subjective circumstances were considered at length by her Honour, who was assisted by a report prepared by a psychologist. The respondent was born in Queensland and was raised by his mother and stepfather. The respondent left home in his late teens and made contact with his father, who introduced the respondent to amphetamines. The respondent continued to abuse amphetamines until 2003 when he married. (The respondent’s wife committed suicide whilst he was in custody awaiting sentence.) 
     
      
    37 When not in custody, the respondent maintained employment as a truck driver. He was able to make periodic payments on the loan from the St George bank for over two years from his legitimate earnings. He had been diagnosed as bipolar and was receiving medication for that disorder, but that was no longer thought appropriate by the author of the psychological report. The respondent’s personality type was said to be “schizoid”. The respondent is not otherwise intellectually or psychologically impaired.  
     
      
    The Judge’s Approach to Sentence38 At the beginning of the remarks, the Judge erroneously attributed all of the offences on both Form Ones to the Specially Aggravated Detain for Advantage offence. This error was acknowledged by the respondent’s representative, yet it was submitted that the sentences for Count 1 on the Indictment and for the Cultivate Cannabis offence were nevertheless properly within the Judge’s sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    39 The criminal history and the respondent’s subjective case were canvassed by the Judge. The respondent gave evidence consistent with what he had told the psychologist, namely that when he was released from gaol he was abusing amphetamines and finding it difficult to integrate back into the community. He claimed that he ran into some of his former associates and that they had planned the offences and offered him payment for his role. The Judge found that this evidence was consistent with his account to the police and was consistent with the amount which the respondent received from the proceeds of the robbery, namely approximately 16% of the takings. The respondent gave evidence of his remorse, claiming that he did not know that the victim was going to be hurt. 
     
      
    40 Acknowledging that the offences on indictment were “most serious”, and that they called for a significant custodial sentence, the Judge took into account in assessing the respondent’s criminality the fact that he was not the instigator of the offence and that he did not anticipate or plan actual violence against the victim. The Judge referred to the fact that the victim was detained for a period of hours and that the actual bodily harm suffered by the victim was not at the upper end of seriousness. Taking these matters into account, the Judge determined that “the offence lies somewhat less than midway on the spectrum of objective seriousness for this specially aggravated form”. It appears that this relates solely to the Specially Aggravated Detain for Advantage offence, albeit the Judge commences this analysis by referring to both of the offences on indictment.41 There is a lack of precision in the Judge’s treatment of the aggravating circumstances relied upon by the Crown, immediately after the remarks summarised at [23]. As to s 21A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (actual or threatened use of violence), the Judge noted that actual violence was a circumstance of aggravation charged against the respondent (as was the fact that the offence was committed in company), so that the threats of violence added little by way of aggravation to the Detain for Advantage offence. Next, the Judge accepted that the use of weapons was an aggravating factor (s 21A(2)(c)) of “the offence”. It would appear that the Judge was once again referring to the Detain for Advantage offence, since there was no evidence before the court as to the possession by the co-offenders of the tomahawk and knife during the commission of the Aggravated Break Enter and Steal offence. The circumstances of aggravation relied upon for that charge was the commission of the offence in company.  
     
      
    42 The Judge then noted that the loss of $20,000 caused by “the offence” was substantial (s 21A(2)(g)). The loss of approximately $20,000 could only have been referable to the Aggravated Break, Enter and Steal offence, but that factor was also an incident of Count 2 of the committal charges, yet there was no mention of it in this context. 
     
      
    43 By way of contrast, when dealing with s 21A(2)(j) (offence committed while on conditional liberty) the Judge said “that is so of this offence and indeed of all of the offences for which he is to be sentenced”. Lastly, the Judge noted s 21A(2)(n) (planned or organised criminal activity) and accepted that the respondent was involved in some limited planning, but that “most of the planning was carried out by his co-offenders”. This was an aggravating feature of both of the offences on indictment and of Counts 2 and 3 on the committal document, but her Honour appears to have confined her remarks to the offences on indictment. There was no further discussion of s 21A(2) in the remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    44 In R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145, Howie J (with whom Grove J and Hall J agreed) emphasised the importance of isolating those aggravating factors that apply to each individual offence, where the court is sentencing an offender on a number of offences. Howie J said at [22] – [23]:- 
     
      
       
        
        If there was a general aggravating feature that applied to all the offences, then it operated in determining the sentence to be imposed for each of the offences. As the principle enunciated in  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         has been taken as requiring that the court determine the appropriate sentence for each offence before considering the question of totality, so his Honour was required to consider the effect of any aggravating or mitigating factor when determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed for each offence before him. If an aggravating factor applied to one or more of the offences but not all of them, then clearly his Honour was required to indicate in respect of which offence or offences that aggravating feature was being taken into account. 
        
       
       
        
        The aggravating or mitigating factors do not necessarily apply globally to all the offences for which sentence is being passed: they may do so or they may not.  
        
       
      
    45 Her Honour did refer to Pearce later in the remarks on sentence, but only in the context of considering totality. After determining a discount of 15% for the offences on indictment and a discount of 25% for the offences the subject of the committal, on account of the respondent’s pleas of guilty, the Judge dealt at length with the respondent’s subjective case and then came to a consideration of the sentences to be imposed.  
     
      
    46 The Judge’s response to the Crown submission, namely, that the respondent’s significant criminal history dictated that greater weight be placed upon the principles of deterrence, retribution and protection of the community, was to highlight the period between 1991 and 2002 when the respondent abstained from criminal behaviour and to accept the respondent’s assertion that he had been drug-free since 2003. As to the former, the respondent was at liberty for a period of four and a half years out of those eleven years, a fact acknowledged by the Judge. As to the latter, the respondent continued to commit offences after 2003, albeit not offences of violence, a fact also acknowledged by the Judge. In summary, the Judge said “Obviously the seriousness of the crimes require adequate punishment and deterrence, but rehabilitation plays a part in the manner in which the sentences are constructed.” 
     
      
    47 The Judge then indicated that, because the offences on indictment were committed on the same day and at the same time, the sentences for those offences would be concurrent. As the Crown submissions made clear, that was a course that was open to her Honour in the exercise of her discretion, but the full text of the Crown submissions bears repeating:- 
     
      
       
        
        The other matters …the Cooma matters, the Crown says are in themselves serious matters. But nowhere near as serious as the matters involving Adam’s Tavern. Yet your Honour will have to – when your Honour ultimately comes to sentencing, in accordance with Pearce, give every offence a sentence and then your Honour will come to a consideration of accumulation and concurrence and the Crown submits that … some degree of accumulation is required in relation to those other matters, the fraud and drug matters committed by this offender. 
        
       
       
        
        In relation to the offence at Adam’s Tavern, particularly ... the specially aggravated detain for advantage. Because I think your Honour is aware of the authorities of both Pearce and … Hammoud, that says there’s no bar on your Honour running offences committed at the same time concurrently. And it might be ultimately what your Honour wants to do in this situation. Because the Crown says that the most serious of those offences is the specially aggravated detain. … But it’s a particularly serious offence because the 25 year maximum penalty come into play because of the fact that there was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the fact that they were in company. 
        
       
      
    48 Later, the Crown submitted:- 
     
      
       
        
        [If] at the end of your Honour’s consideration of the sentences and whether or not they should be concurrent or accumulated your Honour feels that the sentence your Honour imposes is one that will be excessive or crushing, it’s at that point that your Honour then brings the totality principle to bear upon your Honour’s judgment.  
        
       
      
    49 The clear thrust of these submissions, which were undoubtedly correct, was that her Honour was required to fix sentences befitting the objective and subjective criminality of each offence, taking into account the Form One offence in relation to the Specially Aggravated Detain for Advantage, the further Form One offences in relation to the Cultivate Cannabis, and the relevant aggravating circumstances in so far as they applied to individual offences. Then, and only then, could questions of accumulation or concurrency be addressed. However, the Judge determined that fixed terms would be imposed for the fraud and cultivate offences, and that those sentences would be subsumed into the sentences to be imposed for the offences on indictment, before the individual sentences for each offence were assessed.  
     
      
    50 The Judge then proceeded to nominate “the starting point” for each offence. A sentence of eight months for the Cultivate Cannabis offence was reduced to six months after applying the discount for the plea of guilty. A sentence of this order, having regard to six offences on a Form One, before the application of the discount, for a relatively sophisticated, planned operation, committed whilst on bail for other serious offences was wholly inadequate. The respondent had established a sizable plantation with the assistance of heat lamps, chemicals, ventilation devices and a watering system. There is nothing in the remarks on sentence that indicates where on the spectrum of objective gravity this offence lies. A sentence of less than four years at first instance would be, in my view, lenient. The respondent’s subjective circumstances were not so compelling that a reduction to less than a quarter of that penalty could be justified. 
     
      
    51 A sentence of twenty months was nominated for Count 2 of the committal charges, the more serious of the Obtain Financial Advantage by Deception charges. The Judge acknowledged the loss to the bank and the degree of planning inherent in the offence, but a sentence of less than half the maximum penalty, before the application of the discount for the plea of guilty, for an offence displaying these characteristics and committed whilst on conditional liberty is nonetheless excessively lenient.  
     
      
    52 A sentence of six months was then fixed for Count 1 of the committal charges, but no reduction from this sentence was made for the plea of guilty. Assuming that her Honour had already applied the discount, the starting point of eight months also appears unduly lenient for an offence committed whilst on conditional liberty. Whilst there was no loss to the bank in this instance, the respondent received a substantial sum on the strength of his deception, namely, that he was employed full-time with a reputable company and was therefore capable of meeting his commitments. 
     
      
    53 Her Honour then turned to the offences on indictment. A sentence of eight years imprisonment was nominated for the Specially Aggravated Detain for Advantage, reduced to six years and ten months after the application of the discount for the plea of guilty. The Judge fixed a non-parole period of four years and six months, after finding special circumstances. Despite stating that account was taken of the Form One offences when arriving at this sentence, with respect to her Honour, it could not have been a realistic appraisal of the criminality represented by those offences. The Form One documents contained a number of serious offences in their own right, yet the starting point was in the lower third of the range available for this offence.  
     
      
    54 Accepting that the Judge should only have taken into account one offence, that of Armed Robbery of the keys, I am nevertheless of the view that the sentence on this count was manifestly inadequate. The Judge’s recounting of the aggravating factors in relation to this offence earlier in the remarks was not, in my view, translated into a sentence that properly reflected its objective gravity, particularly when the respondent’s subjective factors did little to mitigate his criminality.  
     
      
    55 This was an offence that objectively warranted a sentence in the order of half the maximum penalty, before account was taken of the offence on the Form One. The respondent played a direct and pivotal role. He held a gun at the victim while his co-offenders broke into the Tavern, only leaving after threatening the victim. The respondent’s attention to the victim’s wound did very little, if anything, to ameliorate the victim’s plight. Nor can the respondent’s protestations to the psychologist, that he did not expect anyone to be hurt, justify the extension of any leniency, given that the respondent went to the victim’s home in the company of other offenders who were armed with various weapons. A sentence of 14 years imprisonment, before the application of a discount for the plea of guilty, would have been well within the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    56 The Judge then fixed a term of three years imprisonment for the Aggravated Break Enter and Steal to be served concurrently with the detention offence. Once again, this sentence was well below what was appropriate to reflect the objective gravity of such an offence, committed whilst on conditional liberty, exhibiting a high degree of planning and involving the loss of a substantial sum. The respondent’s claim that he was not involved to any extent in the planning of the offence is of limited relevance. Section 21A(2)(n) fixes upon this characteristic of the offence, not the degree to which an individual offender contributes to the planning. Given the 20 year maximum penalty for this offence, a sentence of 8 years imprisonment at first instance would have been more than justified.  
     
      
    57 Her Honour then said:-  
     
      
       
        
        Under the  
        Pearce  
        principles of totality, I then have to consider to what extent the sentences are to be served concurrently or cumulatively and the start date of the sentences. … In the circumstances of this case, and taking into account principles of totality, and the manner in which the sentences have been constructed, in the exercise of my discretion I have determined that his sentences should start from the date on which he was arrested, which is 13 December 2005 (see R v Callaghan [2006] NSWCCA 58). 
        
       
      
    58 The Judge’s stated approach overlooks the fact that her Honour had already determined that the sentences would be served concurrently and had fixed individual sentences in order to achieve that result. Only the sentence for the Cultivate offence was fixed to commence on 13 December 2005. The sentences for Counts 1 and 2 of the committal document were made wholly cumulative upon that sentence, but concurrent with each other. Both sentences for the offences on indictment were fixed to commence on 13 December 2006, so that the net effect was an aggregate sentence of 21 months imprisonment for the offences on the committal document and an aggregate sentence of six years and ten months for the offences on indictment. The latter aggregate sentence was made partly concurrent with the former to the extent of 9 months.  
     
      
    59 Such an outcome for four quite discrete periods of offending represented by these offences did not comply with the requirements of Pearce. The respondent’s offending occurred in October 2002, early 2003, the latter half of 2004 and mid 2005. The overall result, a total non parole period of five and a half years and a balance of term of two years and four months, failed to reflect the respondent’s significant and extensive offending. Both the individual sentences for the various offences and the aggregate sentence are manifestly inadequate. The extent of the inadequacy is so great that I do not consider this an appropriate matter for the exercise of this Court’s discretion to refuse to intervene. 
     
      
    Re-Sentencing60 I have already noted above the appropriate sentences in respect of each offence. The individual sentences and the aggregate sentence will however be less than ought to have been imposed at first instance, because of the double jeopardy inherent in Crown appeals.  
     
      
    61 The respondent’s subjective case remains unchanged. The Crown took no issue with the extent of the discount allowed on account of the pleas of guilty, nor with the Judge’s finding as to special circumstances. 
     
      
    62 I would propose the following sentences, after the application of a discount of 15% with respect to the offences on indictment, and after the application of a 25% discount with respect to the offences on the committal document:-  
     
      
      Indictment Count 1 – Taking into account the offence on the Form One, a sentence of 11 years imprisonment, comprising a non parole period of 7 years and 4 months, with a balance of term of 3 years and 8 months. 
       
       
      Indictment Count 2 - A sentence of 6 years imprisonment, comprising a non parole period of 4 years and a balance of term of 2 years. 
       
       
      Committal Count 1 - A sentence of 18 months imprisonment.  
       
       
      Committal Count 2 – A sentence of imprisonment for 2 years. 
       
       
      Committal Count 3 – Taking into account the offences on the Form One, a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years. 
       
      
    63 It should be observed that, prima facie, a sentence commences on the date of imposition (s 47(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). The Crown submitted that the Judge ought to have commenced the sentences from 14 March 2007, in order to avoid effectively nullifying the respondent’s balance of parole. The mandatory terms of s 47(3) relate to taking account of a period of custody “in relation to the offence to which the sentence relates.” Arguably, the respondent had been in custody since 13 December 2005 in relation to the balance of parole, not in relation to the offences for which he stood to be sentenced. However, the course I would propose recognises the fact that the respondent is to be re-sentenced after a successful Crown appeal and that the discretion to backdate the sentences was nonetheless available to the Judge. 
     
      
    64 An aggregate non parole period of 10 years and an aggregate sentence of 14 years, which is the least that should be imposed in the circumstances of this case, is achieved by the following proposed orders:- 
     
      
       
      Indictment Count 1 – Taking into account the offence on the Form One, a sentence of 11 years imprisonment, comprising a non parole period of 7 years, to date from 13 December 2008, expiring 12 December 2015 with a balance of term of 4 years, expiring 12 December 2019. 
       
       
      Indictment Count 2 - A sentence of 6 years imprisonment, comprising a non parole period of 4 years, to date from 13 December 2008, expiring 12 December 2012, with a balance of term of 2 years, expiring 12 December 2014. 
       
       
      Committal Count 1 - A sentence of 18 months imprisonment, to date from 13 December 2007, expiring 12 June 2009.  
       
       
      Committal Count 2 – A fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, to date from 13 December 2007, expiring 12 December 2009. 
       
       
      Committal Count 3 – Taking into account the offences on the Form One, a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years, comprising a non parole period of 2 years to date from 13 December 2005, expiring 12 December 2007, with a balance of term of one year, expiring 12 December 2008. 
       
       
      The respondent is eligible for release to parole on 13 December 2015. 
       
      
    65 ROTHMAN J: I agree with the sentence proposed by Latham J. I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons of her Honour and generally I agree with them.  
     
      
    66 I agree that the discretion to backdate the sentence was available to the sentencing judge and should not be disturbed. The balance of parole was served because there was a breach. That breach was the commission of the offence for which the appellant was sentenced and is now to be re-sentenced.  
     
      
    67 In those circumstances the “ordinary rule” is neither “ordinary” nor a “rule”. Especially in circumstances where the breach of parole is taken as an aggravating feature, as it was here and as it should be, not allowing some credit for the additional time in prison may appear to be a double counting, even if in truth it were not. There is a discretion embodied in s 47(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. This is not the occasion to deal fully with the principles, but I consider that the appropriate approach is that described by Simpson J (with whom James and Hall JJ agreed) in Callaghan v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 58; (2006) 160 A Crim R 145 especially at [21]-[23] (but see also the analysis of the cases therein). 
     
      
    68 These offences were most serious and have been treated inappropriately by the sentencing judge. Given Mr Cornwall’s history of offending and disregard for the law, condign punishment is required. I agree with the sentence proposed by Latham J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 27 September 2007, Hall J made the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Pursuant to s.17(1) of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006, Raymond Barry Cornwall is to be detained in a correctional centre for a period of eight months from the date of this order (27 September 2007).  
         
        2 Pursuant to s.20(1) of that Act, I issue a warrant for the committal of Raymond Barry Cornwall to a correctional centre for the duration of the continuing detention order referred to in order [1] above. 
        
       
       
      The appellant appeals from those orders. 
       
       
      STATUTORY PROVISIONS 
      
    2 The appeal raises questions concerning the interpretation and application of the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (the Act). Relevant sections are s.3, the definition of “sex offender and offender” in s.4, s.5, ss.10-14, ss.17-20, and ss.21-22. 
     
      
    3 Prior to an amendment made on the day of the hearing of the appeal, the relevant parts of those sections were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        3 Objects of Act 
         
        The objects of this Act are to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as:  
         
        (a) to ensure the safety and protection of the community, and 
         
        (b) to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders. 
         
         
        sex offender 
         and  
        offender 
         mean a person who has at any time been sentenced to imprisonment following his or her conviction of a serious sex offence, other than an offence committed while the person was a child. 
         
         
        5 Definitions of “serious sex offence” and “offence of a sexual nature” 
         
        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a  
        serious sex offence 
         means any of the following offences:  
         
        (a) an offence under Division 10 of Part 3 of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        , where:  
         
          
          (i) in the case of an offence against an adult or a child, the offence is punishable by imprisonment for 7 years or more, and 
           
          (ii) in the case of an offence against an adult, the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation (within the meaning of the provision under which the offence arises), 
          
         
        … 
         
        10 Term of extended supervision order 
         
        (1) An extended supervision order:  
         
        (a) commences when it is made, or when the offender’s current custody or supervision expires, whichever is the later, and 
         
        (b) expires at the end of such period (not exceeding 5 years from the day on which it commences) as is specified in the order. 
         
        (2) An offender’s obligations under an extended supervision order are suspended while the offender is in lawful custody, whether under this or any other Act or law, but that suspension does not affect the expiry date of the order. 
         
        (3) Nothing in this section prevents the Supreme Court from making a second or subsequent extended supervision order against the same offender. 
         
         
        11 Conditions that may be imposed on supervision order 
         
        An extended supervision order or interim supervision order may direct an offender to comply with such conditions as the Supreme Court considers appropriate, including (but not limited to) directions requiring the offender:  
         
        (a) to permit any corrective services officer to visit the offender at the offender’s residential address at any time and, for that purpose, to enter the premises at that address, or 
         
        (b) to make periodic reports to a corrective services officer, or 
         
        (c) to notify a corrective services officer of any change in his or her address, or 
         
        (d) to participate in treatment and rehabilitation programs, or 
         
        (e) to wear electronic monitoring equipment, or 
         
        (f) not to reside in or resort to specified locations or classes of locations, or 
         
        (g) not to associate or make contact with specified persons or classes of persons, or 
         
        (h) not to engage in specified conduct or classes of conduct, or 
         
        (i) not to engage in specified employment or classes of employment, or 
         
        (j) not to change his or her name. 
         
         
        12 Breach of supervision order 
         
        A person who fails to comply with the requirements of an extended supervision order or interim supervision order is guilty of an offence. 
         
         
        13 Supervision order may be varied or revoked 
         
        (1) The Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke an extended supervision order or interim supervision order on the application of the Attorney General or the offender. 
         
        (2) For the purpose of ascertaining whether to make such an application in relation to an extended supervision order, the Commissioner of Corrective Services must provide the Attorney General with a report on the offender at intervals of not more than 12 months. 
         
         
        14 Application for continuing detention order 
         
        (1) The Attorney General may apply to the Supreme Court for a continuing detention order against a sex offender who, when the application is made, is in custody in a correctional centre:  
         
        (a) while serving a sentence of imprisonment by way of full-time detention:  
         
          
          (i) for a serious sex offence, or 
           
          (ii) for an offence of a sexual nature, or 
          
         
        (b) pursuant to an existing continuing detention order, 
         
        referred to in this Part as his or her  
        current custody 
        . 
         
        (2) An application may not be made until the last 6 months of the offender’s current custody. 
         
        (3) An application must be supported by documentation:  
         
        (a) that addresses each of the matters referred to in section 17 (4), and 
         
        (b) that includes a report (prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner) that assesses the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence. 
         
        (4) An application may indicate the kinds of conditions that the Attorney General would consider appropriate for inclusion under section 11 in the event that an extended supervision order is made. 
         
         
        … 
         
        17 Determination of application for continuing detention order 
         
        (1) The Supreme Court may determine an application for a continuing detention order:  
         
        (a) by making an extended supervision order, or 
         
        (b) by making a continuing detention order, or 
         
        (c) by dismissing the application. 
         
        (2) An extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision. 
         
        (3) A continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 
         
        (4) In determining whether or not to make a continuing detention order or extended supervision order, the Supreme Court must have regard to the following matters in addition to any other matter it considers relevant:  
         
        (a) the safety of the community, 
         
        (b) the reports received from the psychiatrists appointed under section 15 (4) to conduct psychiatric examinations of the offender, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such examination, 
         
        (c) the results of any other assessment prepared by a qualified psychiatrist, registered psychologist or registered medical practitioner as to the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such assessment, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such assessment, 
         
        (d) the results of any statistical or other assessment as to the likelihood of persons with histories and characteristics similar to those of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, 
         
        (e) any treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the offender has had an opportunity to participate, the willingness of the offender to participate in any such programs, and the level of the offender’s participation in any such programs, 
         
        (f) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject while on release on parole or while subject to an earlier extended supervision order, 
         
        (g) the level of the offender’s compliance with any obligations to which he or she is or has been subject under the  
        Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 
         or the  
        Child Protection (Offenders Prohibition Orders) Act 2004 
        , 
         
        (h) the offender’s criminal history (including prior convictions and findings of guilt in respect of offences committed in New South Wales or elsewhere), and any pattern of offending behaviour disclosed by that history, 
         
        (i) any other information that is available as to the likelihood that the offender will in future commit offences of a sexual nature. 
         
        (5) Part 2 applies to an extended supervision order made under this section in the same way as it applies to an extended supervision order made under section 9. 
         
         
        18 Term of continuing detention order 
         
        (1) A continuing detention order:  
         
        (a) commences when it is made, or when the offender’s current custody expires, whichever is the later, and 
         
        (b) expires at the end of such period (not exceeding 5 years from the day on which it commences) as is specified in the order. 
         
        (2) An offender’s custody under a continuing detention order is suspended while the offender is in lawful custody under any other Act or law, but that suspension does not affect the expiry date of the order. 
         
        (3) Nothing in this section prevents the Supreme Court from making a second or subsequent continuing detention order against the same offender. 
         
         
        19 Detention order may be varied or revoked 
         
        (1) The Supreme Court may at any time vary or revoke a continuing detention order or interim detention order on the application of the Attorney General or the offender. 
         
        (2) For the purpose of ascertaining whether to make such an application in relation to a continuing detention order, the Commissioner of Corrective Services must provide the Attorney General with a report on the offender at intervals of not more than 12 months. 
         
         
        20 Warrant of committal 
         
        (1) As soon as practicable after making a continuing detention order or interim detention order against an offender, the Supreme Court must issue a warrant for the committal of the offender to a correctional centre for the period specified in the order. 
         
        (2) A warrant under this section is sufficient authority:  
         
        (a) for any police officer to convey the offender to the correctional centre identified in the warrant, and 
         
        (b) for the governor of the correctional centre to keep the offender in his or her custody in accordance with the terms of the warrant. 
         
         
        21 Nature of proceedings 
         
        Proceedings under this Act (including proceedings on an appeal under this Act) are civil proceedings and, to the extent to which this Act does not provide for their conduct, are to be conducted in accordance with the law (including the rules of evidence) relating to civil proceedings. 
         
         
        22 Right of appeal 
         
        (1) An appeal to the Court of Appeal lies from any determination of the Supreme Court to make, or to refuse to make, an extended supervision order or continuing detention order. 
         
        (2) An appeal may be on a question of law, a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact. 
         
        (3) An appeal against the decision of the Supreme Court may be made, as of right, within 28 days after the date on which the decision was made or, by leave, within such further time as the Court of Appeal may allow. 
         
        (4) The making of an appeal does not stay the operation of an extended supervision order or continuing detention order. 
         
        (5) This section does not limit any right of appeal that may exist apart from this Act. 
        
       
      
    4 The Law Enforcement and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2007, passed on 13 December 2007 and (we are informed) to commence on 21 December 2007, made amendments which would not, in any event, affect the result of this appeal. 
     
      
       
      CIRCUMSTANCES 
      
    5 The criminal history of the appellant is summarised as follows in pars.[10]-[16] of the judgment of the primary judge [2007] NSWSC 1082: 
     
      
       
        
        10 The defendant is presently aged 52 years (date of birth, 13 May 1955). He has a criminal history in relation to sexual and non-sexual offences, and has served a total period of sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales on 6 December 1993 of 14 years. The sentences of imprisonment imposed with respect to the seven counts to which the defendant pleaded guilty commenced on 8 July 1993 and were to expire on 7 July 2007.  
         
        11 The defendant had one conviction in 1975 when he was 23 years of age for an offence of indecent exposure.  
         
        12 The offences for which the defendant was sentenced included:-  
         
          
          • Aggravated sexual assault without consent (x 4) armed  
           
          with intent to commit indictable offence. 
           
          • Sexual intercourse without consent. 
           
          • Stealing. 
          
         
        13 The defendant was, accordingly, sentenced to a total period of 14 years with a non-parole period of 10 years, expiring on 7 July 2003. The defendant served the sentences imposed by way of imprisonment, parole having been refused.  
         
        14 The index offences to which he pleaded guilty, involved, in all, seven offences that occurred on five occasions over a period of two years (between June 1991 and July 1993). The offences consisted of sexual attacks on young women and adolescent girls aged between the age of 13 to 23 years.  
         
        15 In relation to the last-mentioned offences, the defendant approach unknown victims with a knife and exerted physical force and threatened his victims in order to coerce them to undress and perform various sexual acts. The abovementioned stealing offence related to the taking of a handbag from one of his first victims.  
         
        16 A full history of the defendant’s offending was set out in the plaintiff’s written submissions, the accuracy of which was not disputed, and which I reproduce below:-

    6 On 21 June 2007, the Attorney-General filed a summons seeking interim orders under s.8 or s.16 of the Act, an order for psychiatric examinations of the appellant, and the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        5. An order pursuant to s.17(1)(b) of the Act that the defendant be detained in a correctional centre for 5 years from the date of the order.  
         
        6. An order pursuant to s 20(1) of the Act that the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the continuing detention order referred to in paragraph 5 above.  
         
        7. In the alternative to paragraphs 5 and 6 above, an order pursuant to s.17(1)(a) of the Act that the defendant be subject to extended supervision for a period of 5 years from the date of the order by complying with the following conditions:

          d. the defendant must accept home visits, including unannounced visits, by any Probation and Parole officer as directed by that officer;  
           
          e. the defendant must report to a Probation and Parole officer as directed by that officer;  
           
          f. the defendant must comply with any reasonable direction given by a Probation and Parole officer;  
           
          g. the defendant must not associate or make contact with children aged 16 years and under without the presence of a responsible adult approved by the Probation and Parole Service;

    7 Interim orders were granted, and the application for final orders was heard by the primary judge over seven days in August and September 2007.  
     
      
       
      DECISION OF THE PRIMARY JUDGE 
      
    8 At pars.[18]-[31], [46]-[58] and [63]-[115] of the judgment, the primary judge carefully reviewed evidence, including evidence by Mr. Rendell, senior psychologist, Sex Offenders Program; by Ms. Fahs, co-ordinator of the Special Visitation Group within the Department of Corrective Services; by four psychiatrists; by a psychologist Ms. Howell; and by a relative of the appellant. We adopt this review as an accurate and comprehensive account of this evidence. 
     
      
    9 The primary judge referred to the requirements of s.17(3) at par.[43]: 
     
      
       
        
        43 Section 17(3) is a key provision. As Mr Arnott, SC, who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff, with respect, correctly submitted, the burden is on the plaintiff to satisfy the Court  
        “… to a high degree of probability …” 
         that (Plaintiff’s Outline of Submissions, paragraph 37):-  
         
        (a) the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision; and 
         
        (b) adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. 
        
       
      
    10 He noted at par.[60]-[62] that s.17(3) requires the Court to consider two elements; and he found that the medical evidence established the first of them, namely that there was a high risk that the appellant was likely to commit a further serious sexual offence if not kept under supervision. The primary judge stated that the critical question was whether adequate supervision will or will not be provided by an extended supervision order made under the Act.  
     
      
    11 The primary judge accepted that the test under s.17(3) was as stated by McClellan CJ at CL in Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v. Winters [2007] NSWSC 1071 at [50] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        … As the authorities show, the meaning of the word ‘likely’ can vary significantly depending on its context. However, having regard to the purpose and effect of the legislation, notwithstanding my tentative view in  
        Gallagher 
        , in my judgment, in the Act, ‘likely’ means ‘more likely than not’ and it is that test which must be applied in s.9 and s.17. For relevant purposes, the Court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that it is more likely than not that the offender will commit a further serious sex offence. It follows that the defendant’s argument that the chance of re-offending must be significantly higher than 50% must also be rejected. 
        
       
      
    12 The primary judge then gave the following reasons for making the orders he did: 
     
      
       
        
        133 Dr Nielssen also observed that he considered that an appropriate community treatment plan implemented as a condition of a supervision order would reduce his risk of offending to an acceptable level  
        “bearing in mind that the prediction of behaviour is an inexact science” 
        . 
         
        134 The question as to whether or not the plaintiff has established the second limb of s.17(3) is, as already indicated, fundamental to the determination required to be made. In doing so, of course, the Court is required to have regard to the matters set forth in s.17(4) (which includes  
        “(a) the safety of the community” 
        ) and to any other matter that the Court considers relevant.  
         
        135 I have had particular regard in relation to the issues concerning the second limb of s.17(3) both to the terms of the proposed risk management plan (Exhibit 2) and to the evidence given, in particular, by Dr Ellis, Mr Rendell and Ms Howell in relation to the adequacy of that proposed plan. 
         
        136 The terms of the proposed extended supervision order as set out in Exhibit 2 contain separate provisions dealing with the following subject matters:-  
         
        (a) Monitoring, communication and accessing information in relation to the defendant’s progress under an extended supervision order. 
         
        (b) Provisions concerning proposed treatment of the defendant. 
         
        (c) Restrictions in terms of accommodation and other matters. 
         
        137 Although the provisions of s.17(3) do not employ the terms  
        “risk” 
         or  
        “risk management” 
        , plainly the section is directed towards an assessment being made by the Court as to the risk of an offender committing a further serious sex offence in terms, as McClellan CJ at CL in  
        Winters 
         (supra) stated, namely, whether it is more likely than not that an offender would commit such a further offence. In determining what constitutes  
        “adequate supervision” 
         under a proposed extended supervision order, the Court is required to have regard to the nature of the supervision and of the controls and restrictions that would operate under it in order to determine its adequacy to meet the risk referred to in the first limb of s.17(3).  
         
        138 In  
        Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v 
          
        Quinn 
         [2007] NSWSC 456 at [30], I referred to the ordinary meaning of the word  
        “adequate” 
         as including  
        “commensurate in fitness, sufficient, satisfactory” 
        : Shorter Oxford English Dictionary, Fifth Edition. 
         
        139 It is clear that the terms of an extended supervision order must be such as to provide supervision that is  
        “commensurate in fitness, sufficient or satisfactory” 
        , to the assessed risk in terms of the first limb of s.17(3). In this respect,  
        “adequate supervision” 
         would, in my opinion, require such  
        “supervision” 
         as will be adequate, in the above sense, to reduce the risk of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence so that, by reason of such supervision, it is less likely than not that he will re-offend in that regard.  
         
        140 Accordingly, s.17(3) in the present proceedings requires close attention be given to the proposed risk management plan and to the opinions that have been expressed by the expert witnesses to whom I have already referred.  
         
        141 The subject of risk management is, of course, one that operates in a large number of areas of human activity. The risk in many situations (eg, industrial environments) is the risk of careless or inadvertent or negligent conduct that can give rise to or cause damage or harm. 
         
        142 In the context of the Act, the risk is a risk of an offender wilfully or deliberately engaging in activities that would constitute a  
        “serious sex offence” 
        . The proposed management plan in Exhibit 2, when analysed, can be said to provide three levels of defence in the nature of what might be termed as  
        “defence barriers” 
        , namely:-  
         
        (a) The first defence barrier 
         
          
          • Supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. 
           
          • Communication with officers of that Service and other relevant personnel. 
           
          • Monitoring of the defendant’s activities and conduct. 
          
         
        (b) The second defence barrier  
         
          
          • Restrictions as to accommodation. 
           
          • Restriction upon specific activities and movement. 
          
         
        (c) The third defence barrier  
         
          
          • Specialist medical (psychiatric) treatment (including the administration of anti-depressant medication and potentially at a future point in time, anti-libidinal medication). 
           
          • Psychological counselling, treatment and support. 
          
         
        143 It is evidence that each of the controls to be provided by the proposed Risk Management Plan is crucial. Given that, if released, the defendant would be working for limited hours early in the morning of each day, there would be many hours in which he is otherwise not specifically engaged in programmed work. The control to be provided by medical treatment, in particular, medication (what I have termed the  
        “third defence barrier” 
        ), I consider, in the light of the evidence concerning the nature of the defendant’s disorders and the factors underlying them, to be fundamental to the other proposed controls. In the event that prescribed medication is trialled and is established as producing beneficial effects in line with the evidence of Dr Ellis (including, in particular, the suppression of sexual drive), then the level of risk to the community would, of course, be commensurately reduced. Similarly, treatment by way of psychiatric and psychological counselling directed to enhancing what Dr Allnutt has described as the defendant’s  
        “limited repertoire of coping when it came to dealing with stress” 
        , in conjunction with the medical treatment, hopefully will also operate to reduce the risk or likelihood of re-offending by increasing the defendant’s insight, capacity and coping skills.  
         
        144 Accordingly the objective is that a combination of psychiatric and psychological treatment and support will, at some point, result in self-regulated control, given, particularly, Dr Allnutt’s statement that as at the time of his examination on 12 July 2007, his opinion was that he did not believe  
        “… at this stage, he has developed adequate mechanisms of coping with dysphoric moods in a more constructive manner …” 
        . The significance of his dysphoric moods to past offending has been discussed above. 
         
        145 The evidence, in my opinion, plainly establishes that, in the event that Dr Ellis and Ms Howell at a future point in time are in a position to have monitored and assessed the effect on the defendant of both medical (psychiatric) and psychological treatment as having adequately addressed the factors subjacent to the defendant’s personality disorder, then the treatment regime, together with what I have referred to as the first and second lines or barriers of defence, may well be seen to be adequate to bring the risk or likelihood of re-offending down to a level that would enable supervision under an extended supervision order to be considered  
        “adequate supervision” 
        .  
         
        146 The position that presently operates, on the evidence, is that, whilst treatment by medication is, as I have earlier stated, fundamental to the proposed plan, it has not, by reason of a series of circumstances, been trialled for a sufficiently long period of time to enable Dr Ellis to determine what effect it will have upon the defendant, and whether there is a need for an adjustment or change in medical treatment. Similarly, Ms Howell has only recently commenced treatment and has not as yet had the opportunity of developing treatment to a level whereby she is in a position to assess the nature and extent of any beneficial effects which she considers likely to result form such treatment.  
         
        147 In written and oral submissions, it was contended on behalf of the defendant that, in all the circumstances, adequate supervision is available upon the release of the defendant. In his written submissions, Mr Dalton SC, for the defendant, addressed the issues concerning the management of the defendant’s level of risk (paragraphs 22 to 25). He submitted that  
        “adequate supervision”  
        should be interpreted as adequate available supervision to reduce the risk below a high degree of probability of likelihood to re-offend. I have earlier indicated that adequate supervision, in my opinion, must be such that in the case of a high risk serious sex offender, an extended supervision order is required to be such that it would no longer be  
        “likely” 
         (as interpreted by McClellan CJ at CL in  
        Winters 
         (supra)) that the defendant would commit a further serious sex offence. Mr Dalton relied upon the evidence of Dr Allnutt, Dr O’Dea and Mr Rendell as well as Dr Ellis in contending that  
        “the overwhelming balance of the evidence is that the proposed management plan for a period of five years is adequate to appropriately manage his level of risk in the context of s.17(3) …”  
        (paragraph 22(a) of the defendant’s written submission).  
         
        148 Mr Dalton also emphasised the support, which the defendant’s family would provide and the fact that the defendant had no history of breach of parole orders or extended supervision orders.  
         
        149 Whilst Dr Ellis, Mr Rendell and Ms Howell have given evidence, as set out earlier in this judgment (see paragraphs [91], [92], [95] and [111]) that they consider the proposed plan to be adequate to manage the defendant in the community, it would be wrong to treat the answers they gave as to the adequacy of the proposed program divorced or separated from their underlying analyses and diagnoses made of paraphilia and personality disorder, or of the need for specific medical and psychological treatment to be implemented and taken to a stage that will provide the defendant with the necessary capacity and coping skills. The evidence is that it will take some time before the effects of the medication are capable of being assessed and reviewed and, as necessary, modified or adjusted to produce the necessary outcome of reducing the assessed likelihood of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence.  
         
        150 Dr Ellis’ evidence was to the effect that he has not yet been able to make such an assessment and, as stated above, Ms Howell has only recently embarked upon a treatment program. It will require time for her to exercise her professional expertise in order to develop those matters considered necessary for the defendant to develop the required self-regulation.  
         
        151 The difficult matter of risk prediction, emphasised by the expert witnesses, is one that requires an assessment of all the evidence, taking into account the practical operation of an extended supervision order having regard to the particular offender. That practical approach must require some regard to the fact that, although the defendant has not displayed sexually deviant behaviour whilst in prison, the more stimulating environment of the general community for the defendant, who presently lacks the capacity for self-regulation, if released, is a factor to be brought into account in the assessment to be made under s.17(3). 
         
        152 Mr Dalton referred to the fact that Mr Arnott did not put to the experts that they were incorrect in the specific opinions they expressed as to the adequacy of the proposed plan. It is to be remembered that, in this Court, determining an application under the Act, it is required to examine all the evidence (including the opinions expressed by the expert witnesses to which I have specifically referred above). Ultimately, it is for the Court to determine what evidence it ought to accept. A trial judge is not bound to accept expert opinion evidence, particularly where it is evidence on an ultimate issue:  
        Makita (Australia) Pty Limited v Sprowles 
         (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [89] per Heydon JA, as his Honour then was.  
         
        153 In the course of his submissions, Mr Dalton adverted to the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in  
        Winters 
         (supra). The Chief Judge, in that case, referred to the evidence, in particular, of Mr Rendell and expressed confidence in the proposed management plan. His Honour also referred (paragraph 143) to the strict conditions proposed including conditions for monitoring, counselling and the  
        “continuing administration of anti-libidinal medication will, based on past experience, significantly reduce his sex drive. Of course, his continuing ability to accept this form of medication remains uncertain” 
        .  
         
        154 In the judgment (at 144), McClellan CJ at CL also observed:- 
         
          
          “But for two matters, I would have been satisfied that adequate supervision could be provided by an extended supervision order. In the words of the statute, the consequence of the two problems is that I cannot be satisfied that adequate supervision could be provided by an extended supervision order.” 
          
         
        155 It is important to note that his Honour’s observations are to be construed in light of the evidence adduced in  
        Winters 
        . The Chief Judge recorded (paragraph 51) that, whereas on occasions the defendant in that case had exhibited behaviour consistent with a continuing tendency to commit sexual offences,  
        “… he was, for a time, administered anti-libidinal medication during which there were no reports of unsatisfactory conduct. He chose not to continue with the medication because of side effects …” 
        .  
         
        156 Accordingly, in  
        Winters 
        , there had been a trial of anti-libidinal medication from which it was possible to assess that the defendant’s tendency in that case to commit sexual offences had been attenuated. In the present case, there has, of course, been no trialling of either anti-depressant or anti-libidinal medication. Whether they are suitable medications for the defendant remains to be seen. It is, of course, hoped that they will be suitable and that other treatment over time will enhance the defendant’s capacity.  
         
        Determining the duration of a continuing detention order 
         
        157 The maximum period of a continuing detention order is five years: s.18(1)(b ). In determining in a particular case the appropriate period for such an order, the Court, in my opinion, should seek to identify those facts or matters that should guide its determination.  
         
        158 In the present case, the defendant will, at least in the short term, require both medical and psychological treatment and potentially may benefit from participation in the CUBIT program which he has stated to Dr Ellis he is prepared to do. That program can take approximately eight months to complete. I take those matters into account in determining the period which I consider to be appropriate for the continuing detention order which I propose to make. The question of the need for ongoing treatment and support beyond the release date will obviously be a matter for future determination. 
        
       
       
      GROUNDS OF APPEAL 
      
    13 The appellant relies on the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in his interpretation of s.17  
        Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 
        , 2006.  
         
        2. His Honour erred in his application of s.17  
        Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act,  
        2006, particularly in his finding that adequate supervision would not be provided by an extended supervision order.  
         
        3. His Honour erred in both fact and law in that whatever arguable interpretation is placed on s.17 the only reasonable option available was an extended supervision order in accordance with the proposed Risk Management Plan.  
        
       
      
    14 To the extent that the grounds challenged the primary judge’s finding in relation to the first element in s.17(3), the appellant did not press these grounds, having regard to the decision in Tillman v. Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327. Accordingly, argument in the case proceeded in relation to satisfaction of the second element of s.17(3). 
     
      
       
      SUBMISSIONS 
      
    15 The essence of the submissions made by Mr. Haesler SC for the appellant was that the primary judge did not address the question posed by the second element of s.17(3) of the Act, namely whether the Court “was satisfied to a high degree of probability … that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order”; that he made no finding to that effect; and that his reasons in substance showed that he made a continuing detention order rather than an extended supervision order because he was not satisfied that adequate supervision would be provided by an extended supervision order (that is, that he reversed the onus of proof).  
     
      
    16 Mr. Haesler submitted that, on the basis of the primary judge’s findings and reasons, it was clear that the Court would not be satisfied, to a high degree of probability, that adequate supervision would not be provided; and that this Court should allow the appeal, set aside the continuing detention order, and make an extended supervision order. 
     
      
    17 Mr. Babb SC for the respondent submitted that the primary judge did state the test correctly at par.[43] and [133] of his judgment, carefully examined the risk-management plan, and at par.[143] found the third defence barrier was “fundamental”. He submitted that the effect of the judge’s reasons at par.[143]-[156] was that he was appropriately satisfied that an extended supervision order giving effect to the management plan would not reduce the risk to the extent that the appellant would not be likely to commit a further serious sex offence. If the Court considered that the primary judge had not addressed the correct question and/or made the correct finding, or that the more particular findings of the primary judge did not support a correct finding, the Court should send the matter back for a further first instance hearing. 
     
      
       
      PRINCIPLES 
      
    18 It is a fundamental principle of criminal law that a person convicted of a crime must be given punishment appropriate to that crime and no more: Veen v. The Queen (1979) 143 CLR 458, Veen v. The Queen (No.2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. Another fundamental principle of criminal law is that, subject to the possibility of appeal, the appropriate punishment is determined once and for all when the person is sentenced for the crime: this is one aspect of a wider principle requiring finality in litigation. Of course, the sentence may, for example by leaving open the possibility for parole, allow for some variation in how it operates, depending on future circumstances. But the appropriateness of the sentence itself cannot later be challenged. 
     
      
    19 Thus if, in addition to appropriate punishment for crimes they have committed, persons are to have their liberty further restricted because of what they might do in the future, this requires justification outside the ordinary principles of criminal law, and outside the ordinary principle that interference with liberty is generally restricted to interference that is deserved by reason of actual criminal conduct. In passing the Act, the New South Wales legislature has determined that, for the protection of the public, there should in specific cases be restrictions of liberty on that basis. In the second reading speech when the Bill for the Act was before the New South Wales parliament, the Honourable Tony Kelly, Minister for Justice, said this: 
     
      
       
        
        One particular concern, that is dealt with by this scheme, relates to a handful of high-risk, hard-core offenders who have not made any attempt to rehabilitate whilst in prison. These offenders make up a very small percentage of the prison population, yet their behaviour poses a very real threat to the public. These concerns are compounded where the offender never qualifies for parole and is released at the end of their sentence totally unsupervised. 
         
         
        The proposed legislation will address this problem by allowing this small group of high-risk offenders to be placed on extended supervision, or, in only the very worst cases, kept in custody.  
         
         
        The Department of Corrective Services has advised that only a small number of offenders would fall into this very high-risk category. 
        
       
      
    20 In Tillman v. Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327, the majority of the New South Wales Court of Appeal (Giles and Ipp JJA, Mason P dissenting) held that the word “likely” in s.17(3) of the Act did not require a degree of probability exceeding 50%. In this respect, they applied a Victorian decision on similarly worded legislation, namely TSL v. Secretary to the Department of Justice (2006) 14 VR 109. In par.[85]-[89] of their judgment in Tillman, Giles and Ipp JJA said this: 
     
      
       
        
        85 Firstly, s.17(3) uses the expressions “high degree of probability” and “likely” in close proximity. There is, therefore, a strong inference that Parliament intended to distinguish between the meanings conveyed by the two expressions. Applying their natural meanings, “high degree of probability” denotes a higher degree of probability than “likely”. Linguistically, one would more readily attribute a meaning of “beyond more probable than not” to a “high degree of probability” than to “likely”.  
         
        86 Secondly, giving “likely” the meaning of “high degree of probability” (in ss 17(2) and (3)) creates an oddity of language. One would be left with a section reading something like “a continuing detention order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that it is highly probable that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision”. It would have been far easier for Parliament, had such a meaning been intended, to provide, “an extended supervision order may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied that there is a high probability of the offender committing a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision”. The repetition of the notion of “a high degree of probability” involved in the construction for which the claimant contends, militates – linguistically - against that construction.  
         
        87 Thirdly, the repeated use of the word “likelihood” in ss 17(4)(c), 17(4)(d) and 17(4)(i) (and the omission, in these sections, of the expression “high probability”) supports the inference that the notion of “likely” and “likelihood” is intended to have a meaning different to “a high degree of probability”.  
         
        88 In our view, there is much to be said for the view expressed by McClellan CJ at CL in  
        Winters 
        , namely, that “likely” is used in the section as meaning more probable than not. On the other hand, it is a respectable view that the legislature recognised the infringement of personal liberty by requiring satisfaction to a high degree of probability, so that it would be wrong to impose in the shade of meaning adopted for “likely” a further strict requirement of likelihood in the sense of more probable than not. There is ambiguity in the word “likely”, and if unconstrained we would tend towards his Honour’s view. Nevertheless, the view expressed in  
        TSL 
         is reasonably open and we are not persuaded that it is clearly wrong. In the light of what has emanated from the High Court in regard to the respect that an intermediate appellate court of one Australian jurisdiction should give to a decision of an intermediate appellate court of another Australian jurisdiction on issues that are substantially the same, we would follow and adopt the approach of Callaway AP in  
        TSL 
        .  
         
        89 Accordingly, we would hold that the word “likely” in ss 17(2) and (3) denotes a degree of probability at the upper end of the scale, but not necessarily exceeding 50 per cent. The remarks Bell J made when articulating the test she intended to apply are to be understood in this sense. Her Honour said (at [29]):  
         
          
          “I have approached the determination in this case upon the basis that ‘likely’ in this context conveys the sense that it is probable, as distinct from possible, that the defendant will commit a further serious sex offence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    21 The expression “a high degree of probability” indicates something “beyond more probably than not”; so that the existence of the risk, that is the likelihood of the offender committing a further serious sex offence, does have to be proved to a higher degree than the normal civil standard of proof, though not to the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, the risk or likelihood itself does not have to be a probability to the civil standard of proof, but rather a sufficiently substantial probability to satisfy the criterion “likely” as explained in TSL. 
     
      
    22 On that approach, when one comes to the second element of s.17(3), what is required is satisfaction to a high degree of probability (that is, beyond a mere balance of probabilities) that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order; that is, that even if there is an extended supervision order, the offender will nevertheless still be likely to commit a further serious sex offence.  
     
      
       
      APPLICATION 
      
    23 In our opinion, there is no clear finding by the primary judge to the effect that the second element of s.17(3) is satisfied in this case; and the general impression given by the crucial paragraphs of the judgment, namely pars.[134]-[156], is that it was not established that the extended supervision order would obviate the likelihood that the offender would commit a further serious sex offence. Such a view would not satisfy the requirement of s.17(3), which is, as we have said, that the Court must be satisfied to a high degree of probability that an extended supervision order would not obviate such a likelihood.  
     
      
    24 In substance, Mr. Babb’s submission was that the primary judge was so satisfied, because the risk that the extended supervision order would not be effective meant that, despite the extended supervision order, the appellant would still be likely to commit a further serious sexual offence. The closest the judgment comes to supporting this is in the last sentence of par.[149] of the primary judge’s judgment:  
     
      
       
        
        The evidence is that it will take some time before the effects of the medication are capable of being assessed and reviewed and, as necessary, modified or adjusted to produce the necessary outcome of reducing the assessed likelihood of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence. 
        
       
      
    25 However, in our opinion, neither this sentence nor any other part of the judgment adequately addresses the crucial question: is the possibility that the medication regime under the extended supervision order will not work (because it has not yet been tested) such as to satisfy the Court to a high degree of probability, that (even with the extended supervision order in place) it is still likely that the offender will commit a further serious sexual offence? In our opinion, the primary judge did not squarely address and answer that question. 
     
      
    26 In those circumstances, this Court has the alternative of either deciding the question itself, or sending the matter back for a further first instance hearing. In our opinion, this Court should decide the question itself if it is able to do so without detriment to the parties, and can do so on the basis of the appeal documents and the primary judge’s primary findings of fact.  
     
      
    27 In doing so, we should have regard to the matters set out in s.17(4), so far as they are relevant to the second element of s.17(3). The matter in s.17(4)(a), “the safety of the community”, is only indirectly relevant to this question, to the extent that it informs the correct approach to the understanding of the expressions “likely to commit a further serious sex offence” and “adequate supervision”. That matter is directly relevant to the question of the Court’s discretion, which however arises only after the two elements of s.17(3) have both been satisfied. 
     
      
    28 It is to be noted that the appellant is not a person who has not made any attempt to rehabilitate while in prison, and in that respect is not within the class of persons referred to in the second reading speech as the persons for whom the Act was intended. He participated in two Sex Offender Psycho-Education (SOPE) courses between 1997 and 2000. He did not participate in the Custody Based Intensive Treatment Program (CUBIT) run by the Department, in circumstances where prior to 2005 participants had to acknowledge all elements recorded in police and court documents about their offending. The appellant admitted to the substance of the sexual assaults, but denied some of the allegations.  
     
      
    29 It was noted by Mr. Rendell that he saw no documentation indicating that the appellant had any institutional convictions or punishments. He also noted that the appellant had been well-behaved during his imprisonment and had received no adverse case management reports in respect of his work or conduct. 
     
      
    30 It is true that the consensus of expert opinion was that the appellant was in the high-risk category relative to other adult male sex offenders, on the basis of both static and dynamic risk factors. However, subject to the considerations referred to by the primary judge in the paragraphs set out above, the consensus was that adequate supervision could be provided by an extended supervision order. 
     
      
    31 In our opinion, the circumstance that it is not possible to determine, one way or the other, whether medication will be effective, cannot justify a conclusion, to a high degree of probability, that even if the offender is subject to an extended supervision order, he will still be likely to commit a further serious sex offence. Such a conclusion would, in our opinion, require it to be shown positively that the risk that the medication would not be successful was so substantial that, even with an extended supervision order in place, there was a high degree of probability that the appellant would still be likely so to offend. 
     
      
    32 The primary judge was correct to say he was not bound to accept expert evidence, particularly on the ultimate issue. However, there was no expert evidence to the effect that adequate supervision would not be provided by an extended supervision order, or to the effect that, even with such an order in place, the appellant would still be likely to commit a further serious sex offence. In circumstances where the consensus of expert evidence was to the effect that adequate supervision would be provided by an extended supervision order, in our opinion the evidence and the particular findings of the primary judge did not justify a conclusion that adequate supervision would not be provided.  
     
      
    33 Accordingly, in our opinion the second element of s.17(3) is not satisfied in this case; and the Court has no discretion to make a continuing detention order.  
     
      
    34 For these reasons, the appeal should be allowed, the continuing detention order set aside, and an extended supervision order made. 
     
      
       
      TERMS OF ORDER 
      
    35 There was no substantial contest below that, if an extended supervision order was made, it should be for five years. We think this is appropriate. The terms of the order were substantially agreed, but subject to the following matters. 
     
      
    36 One issue as to the terms of the order was whether there should be a requirement that the appellant wear an electronic monitoring device. In our opinion, it is appropriate to give weight to the consideration of the safety of the community in determining what conditions to impose, and to take a cautious approach. Should the Probation and Parole Service at any time consider that the device is not necessary or counter-productive, then the order should give the flexibility of dispensation with the requirement. Accordingly, it should be a condition of the order that the appellant wear such a device, if and as directed by a Probation and Parole Officer.  
     
      
    37 Another issue was whether the appellant must inform the officer in charge of monitoring his movements of his movements on a daily basis. In our opinion, it is sufficient that he inform that officer of his proposed daily movements on a weekly basis, and inform that officer immediately of any change.  
     
      
    38 The final issue as to the terms of the order was whether there should be a requirement that the appellant be at his address between the hours of 9pm and 6am unless his presence at another place during those hours has been approved by Probation and Parole. In our opinion, again taking a cautious approach, there should be such a requirement.  
     
      
    39 The Court makes the following orders. In the published version of the judgment, there should not be identification of the relatives mentioned in Conditions 19 and 20, and in Note (iii).  
     
      
      1. Appeal allowed with costs. 
       
      2. Set aside the orders made by the Court on 27 September 2007 and in lieu thereof, order:

      19. The appellant must attend a six-monthly meeting with all agencies/parties including [relatives] in attendance if required by the appointed representative of the Department and/or the relevant probation and parole officer, at which point the Risk Management Plan should be reviewed and adjusted commensurate with the risk as it is determined by all the parties at that point.  
       
       
      General obligations  
       
      20. The appellant must not associate or be in contact with children less than 18 years old unless that contact is approved and supervised by the Probation and Parole Service (except for family functions, when he must be supervised at all times by [a relative]).

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 MASON P: Following a trial before Judge Berman SC and a jury the appellant was convicted on a charge of aggravated stealing of a set of keys. The circumstance of aggravation was the infliction of violence immediately after the theft. 
     
      
    2 The victim was returning to his residence on the northern side of Orwell Street, Potts Point. Orwell Street runs from Victoria Street in the west to McLeay Street in the east. On its southern side, a little to the east of the victim’s residence, is the entrance to Springfield Gardens Mall. 
     
      
    3 It was about 2am on 11 December 2005. The victim was moderately affected by alcohol. He passed a group of about four men standing together near the intersection of Orwell Street and the Mall. Hearing their footsteps behind him he sped up, attempting to reach home as fast as possible. He removed his keys from his pocket as he approached the entrance. A male voice demanded: “Give me your keys”. The victim responded “Go fuck yourself”. As he did, his keys were snatched from his hand and he was set upon with punches to the face and head. 
     
      
    4 The victim believed that two men in the group commenced to punch him and that they were joined by a third male in the assaults. The victim was pushed back against the wall outside his residence. He heard a male voice shout: “Stop, police” whereupon his attackers ran off in the direction of McLeay Street. The victim described the original assailants as “Arabs” and “definitely the same guys” he had seen earlier. He was unable to describe them further. The third man was described as being in his early to mid-20s, about 5’11” in height, with a shaved head and a few days stubble on his face, wearing a navy blue Adidas tracksuit top. (It is not suggested that this was the appellant.) 
     
      
    5 One of the assailants was Bassam Charrouf. He was originally indicted jointly with the appellant and another man, Ali Fajajo. During the trial he was discharged because the interests of justice required him to be tried separately. At the conclusion of the trial the appellant and Fajajo were found guilty of identical charges.  
     
      
    6 The identity of Charrouf and Fajajo as two of the assailants was not put in issue by the appellant at his trial or in this appeal. 
     
      
    7 Two police officers were sitting in an unmarked vehicle on the southern side of Orwell Street facing east towards McLeay Street. Their car was about 37 metres from the crime scene (Tr p216). When they saw the crime commence they ran towards the group yelling: “Police, stop”.  
     
      
    8 Constable Brooks observed two men approach the victim, talk to him and then pin him against the wall directly outside the doorway. Brooks saw two further men join the group and assist in pinning the victim before punches were thrown by the whole group. Constable Rush did not see the start of the incident, but observed the four men attacking the victim as he ran towards the incident. 
     
      
    9 All four men had hoods pulled over their heads. 
     
      
    10 Constable Brooks identified the first two assailants as Charrouf and Fajajo and one of the second group as the appellant. The fourth man was described as wearing a blue and white jumper. 
     
      
    11 The identification evidence concerning the appellant given by Constable Brooks and Constable Rush was cogent and specific.  
     
      
    12 The appellant’s counsel informed the judge that it would not be suggested that the officers were unable to recognise the appellant. His case was that they were mistaken in stating that he joined in the assault (Tr p178). The case was fought before the jury on this basis. 
     
      
    13 Constable Brooks had previously seen the appellant at least a dozen times, spoken to him, and was very familiar with his physical appearance (Tr p183). He also identified him by reference to his clothing, an identification corroborated in this regard by the CCTV evidence referred to below. The officer had no doubt that the appellant ran over and joined the group attacking the victim (Tr pp183, 185, 193). 
     
      
    14 Constable Brooks said that he got to about 10 metres of the appellant before he recognised him. He later revised this estimate to 15 metres (Tr p216). The appellant had his hood up and the officer only recognised him when the appellant turned and looked at him before running off towards the entrance to the Mall (Tr pp151, 190-1, 194).  
     
      
    15 Constable Rush also identified the appellant as one of the men punching the victim in the face. He had previously seen the appellant between 15 and 20 times and was very familiar with his appearance (Tr p209). The officer was first able to recognise the appellant as one of the assailants after he got out of the car, ran towards the group and got to under 20 metres away from the crime scene (Tr p232). 
     
      
    16 According to the officers, as they ran towards the group yelling: “Stop, police”, Charrouf looked in their direction and then ran across to the south side of Orwell Street and into Springfield Gardens. The other three continued punching and wrestling the victim, apparently unaware of the police for a time. Then they stopped and looked in the direction of the police before themselves running into the Gardens (Tr pp63, 69-70). 
     
      
    17 Fajajo was the last to leave, but because he was the slowest he alone was caught and arrested that night (Tr pp70, 153). 
     
      
    18 Charrouf and the appellant were arrested the following day. 
     
      
    19 It was established that the three identified men had been together at the Crest Hotel, Kings Cross about half an hour before the attack. They left in a group with some others, proceeding to Orwell Street via Springfield Gardens. They pulled up their hoods, despite it being a summer evening. 
     
      
    20 The appellant admitted formally that he was in Orwell Street, wearing a grey hooded “Champion” jacket, and that he was the man shown in security camera footage identified as UM1 (see below). 
     
      
    21 He also gave evidence that he was present in Orwell Street at the time the offence was committed, but he denied prior knowledge of the offence or participation in it. He saw an incident involving two unknown men with hoods throwing punches. Two other men approached the group with guns. The appellant said that he kept walking in a westerly direction towards Victoria Street. 
     
      
    22 The jury were entitled to be very sceptical about the appellant’s asserted inability to have recognised Charrouf as one of the assailants. 
     
      
    23 In cross-examination, the appellant said that he had been at the Crest Hotel with Charrouf, Fajajo and another man. But he maintained that he was not in their company when walking along Orwell Street. Before the group got to Orwell Street they were “in front of me and it was pretty dark in Springfield Mall and then I lost them” (Tr p277). He turned left into Orwell Street, saw a fight happening, spoke to a person who asked him for change, and saw the two “civilians” run up, one holding a gun. 
     
      
    24 The appellant makes no complaint about the directions given to the jury, including the directions concerning the risks of wrongful identification. 
     
      
    25 The sole ground of appeal is that the conviction was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. It is contended that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s participation in the bashing that accompanied the theft of the victim’s house key. 
     
      
    26 CCTV footage is said to destroy or seriously undermine the police testimony implicating the appellant in the assault that the jury were otherwise entitled to accept. The CCTV evidence consists of a series of still photographs a little under a second apart, each bearing a computer-recorded time signature.  
     
      
    27 The offender Charrouf, who was the first to run away from the police, ran east along Orwell Street then turned south into the open space known as Springfield Gardens. His entry into the open space is captured on CCTV footage from a security camera pointing north (UM 2) showing him entering the Gardens from Orwell Street (Ex 12). 
     
      
    28 Charrouf is first shown clearly in the photographic still 01:57:45.984. He was then less than 23 metres from the crime scene because 23.4 metres was the distance measured from the crime scene to a column in the Gardens that is a little to the south of where Charrouf is first depicted in the UM 2 stills. 
     
      
    29 There is an earlier still taken from UM 2 (01:57:44.967) that appears to show a darkly dressed runner (not Charrouf) entering the Gardens from Orwell Street. He overtakes Charrouf in later pictures. 
     
      
    30 A different camera (UM 1) was fixed to the northwest corner of the Springfield Gardens apartments looking east along Orwell Street on the southern side. Exhibit 13 was a series of eight stills printed from what was captured by that camera. The time signature depicted in those stills was generated by the same computer that recorded the pictures taken by camera UM 2. In other words there was synchronicity. 
     
      
    31 Camera UM 1 captured photographs of the appellant walking in a westerly direction along the southern side of Orwell Street. This was as he moved towards the police car, walking on the opposite side of Orwell Street to the crime scene. The appellant is first shown at 01:57:33.886 moving towards the camera. He is last shown (head only) at 01:57:41.237, still proceeding in a westerly direction on the southern footpath of Orwell Street, close to the curb. He was then about 16 metres from the crime scene (Tr p308). 
     
      
    32 The period between the last still of the appellant taken by camera UM 1 and the first still of the fleeing Charrouf taken by camera UM 2 is a gap of 4.75 seconds. It shall be referred to as the window period. 
     
      
    33 The period between the last still of the appellant taken by camera UM 1 and the first still in Ex 12, apparently showing a darkly dressed runner entering the Gardens, is 3.73 seconds. 
     
      
    34 The appellant’s case, in short, is that 4.75 seconds ought to have been regarded by the jury as an insufficient time for the appellant to have moved from the southern footpath of Orwell Street across to the crime scene, for the assault to have taken place, and for Charrouf to have run to where he was filmed entering Springfield Gardens. Accordingly, the jury ought not to have accepted beyond reasonable doubt the police evidence implicating the appellant in the bashing. This point was squarely raised at trial (see Tr p146). 
     
      
    35 On the basis of the police account, the appellant first took an active role in the assault when he set off running across Orwell Street towards the crime scene that was 16 metres away from where he was last depicted walking westwards in the UM 1 stills. 
     
      
    36 However, the first phase of the crime was almost certainly already in progress when the appellant moved off from the southern side of Orwell Street to assist his companions Charrouf and Fajajo. The evidence of Constable Brooks was that the appellant was not one of the original assailants. 
     
      
    37 The police officers saw the first phase of the crime and they reacted promptly, running towards the incident. It is therefore quite conceivable that they moved from their car at about the same time that the appellant moved from the southern side of the street. The officers recognised the appellant as one of the four hooded assailants when they got to within an estimated 10 metres (Brooks) or 20 metres (Rush) from him. 
     
      
    38 On the police evidence, Charrouf heard and reacted to the police presence first and he was the first to run away into Springfield Gardens. The other three men kept punching the victim before they reacted to the police and then in turn ran into the Gardens. Whether all four assailants were ever punching the victim simultaneously is far from clear on the totality of the evidence.  
     
      
    39 Evidence from Constable Rush referring to “the group” (eg Tr pp210, 232) is consistent with some (eg the appellant) joining the fray at the very time that Charrouf left. Both officers were clear that Charrouf ran off first (Tr pp138, 235). 
     
      
    40 It follows that, on the police evidence, the appellant would still have been participating in the assault for at least some of the time it took Charrouf to travel less than 23 metres from the crime scene to where he was first shown fleeing into the Gardens. This is the central fallacy in the appellant’s attempt to treat the 4.75 “window period” as probative of anything relevant.41 In so concluding, I have accepted for the purpose of argument the appellant’s estimates that Charrouf ran at about roughly 6 to 7 metres per second. (Amended Submissions paras 7.3-7.4.) 
     
      
    42 In my opinion, the arguments based upon the timing of the footage from cameras UM 1 and UM 2 did not mean that the jury ought to have had a reasonable doubt about accepting the Crown case based essentially upon the evidence of the two police officers. The concept of a window period of 4.75 seconds is artificial and misconceived. Charrouf’s participation in the assault could have commenced before the window period started and the appellant’s participation in the assualt could have been continuing until close to when it ended. 
     
      
    43 The appellant also sought to develop the timing argument in alternative ways. 
     
      
    44 There were calculations of the time it would have taken the police officers to react to their earliest observation of the crime and to move from their car to where they first identified the appellant as one of the assailants. This exercise involves the fallacy of concluding that the police only moved off after all four men were punching the victim. Paragraph 7.8 of the appellant’s submission accepted that the officers only commenced their run up Orwell Street after the appellant had crossed over to the crime scene. It is conceivable that the officers and the appellant reacted almost simultaneously to the commencement of the assault. 
     
      
    45 I have not overlooked other submissions based upon estimates by the officers as to the “split second” or the (small) number of seconds it took them to do things or during which they observed a particular activity. Given the intense activities observed and the officers’ attempts to stop the crime and catch the attackers I place very little weight on such time estimates made in the agony of the moment. 
     
      
    46 Other arguments raised in the written submissions are entirely speculative and/or unconvincing. These include hypotheses based upon camera footage suggestive of other persons fleeing the crime scene. 
     
      
    47 There was one remaining submission. As presented, the prosecution case against the appellant required the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew a robbery was occurring at the time he ran across Orwell Street to join the other offenders assaulting the victim.  
     
      
    48 The appellant was not immediately present when the victim was first approached and his keys demanded. The prosecution case as to knowledge was circumstantial, basing itself upon the appellant’s association with the other offenders earlier in the evening at the Crest Hotel; the appellant having accompanied Charrouf and the others through Springfield Gardens and into Orwell Street; the appellant’s presence on the opposite side of Orwell Street when the offence began; the appellant’s attire (wearing a hood); and the appellant’s willingness to become involved in offering violence to the victim. 
     
      
    49 The appellant submits that this circumstantial evidence was insufficient to exclude the possibility that his knowledge was limited to the fact of an assault in company. I do not agree. In my view, the jury were entitled to reason that the appellants saw and/or knew the purpose of his companions pinning the victim to the wall. It was not necessary that he knew the particular item of personal property taken.  
     
      
    50 As Hayne J said in Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 235 ALR 517 at [113] “the question for an appellate court is whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant’s guilt. It is not sufficient to show that there was material which might have been taken by the jury to be sufficient to preclude satisfaction of guilt to the requisite standard.” 
     
      
    51 In my opinion, it was open to the jury upon the whole of the evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty.  
     
      
    52 I would therefore dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J for the reasons which she has given. 
     
      
    2 HULME J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    3 SIMPSON J: On 23 February 2006, in the Coffs Harbour District Court, the appellant was arraigned on an indictment that contained two counts, presented in the alternative. It is necessary to set out in full the terms of the indictment. They were that the appellant:  
     
      
       
        
        “1A On 1 November 2004 at Sawtell in the State of New South Wales did break and enter a pavilion, namely Sawtell Bowling and Recreation Club, Sawtell, and did commit a serious indictable offence therein namely stealing, at the time being in company with Dudley Ian Shaw, being armed with an offensive weapon and inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Wayne Richard Dennett. 
         
         
        1B On 1 November 2004 at Sawtell in the State of New South Wales did break and enter a pavilion, namely Sawtell Bowling and Recreation Club, Sawtell, and did commit a serious indictable offence therein namely stealing, at the time being in company with Dudley Ian Shaw.” 
        
       
      
    4 On 7 March 2006, after the close of the Crown case, and with the consent of the then counsel for the appellant, the trial judge (McLoughlin DCJ) granted leave to amend each count in the indictment by substituting the words “on or about” for the word “on”, thus broadening the allegation as to the date of the offence.  
     
      
    5 The appellant entered a plea of not guilty to each count. On 10 March the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the first count. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 6 years to commence on 26 February 2006. He now appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
    6 The Crown concedes that, at least in part, the appeal against conviction must succeed, and, accordingly, that leave to appeal against sentence ought to be granted, and that appeal also ought to be allowed. It will be necessary to explain the basis for this concession. It will also be necessary to deal with other grounds of appeal which, if made good, would result in a greater degree of success to the appellant than the Crown concedes. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    7 It is convenient to begin with an outline of the Crown case. Because of the limited area of the grounds of appeal that can be done relatively succinctly, although it will be necessary in due course to examine more closely some of the evidence in the Crown case. For present purposes it is sufficient to say the following. The Crown case was that, sometime prior to 1 November 2004, the appellant and Dudley Shaw reached an agreement unlawfully to enter the Sawtell Bowling and Recreation Club (to which I will refer simply as “the Club”) and steal money, either by stealing an Automatic Teller Machine, or its contents, and money from poker machines and a safe. Sometime earlier they had, in fact, investigated the possibility of obtaining access to the ATM from underneath the Club floor but had been unable to achieve this. 
     
      
    8 They therefore agreed that, on a Sunday evening (the timing selected in order to maximise the potential gain) they would enter the Club and either remove the ATM or obtain the money it contained, and also to remove money from poker machines and a safe. They proposed to do this at a time when they knew a cleaner would be present in the Club. Their intention was to disable him by tying him up. An important part of the arrangement was that access would be gained through a window which would, prior to their entry, have been left partly opened. Sunday, 31 October was chosen for the enterprise. On that evening the two men, in company with another (Shane Whitehouse) travelled to the Club and waited for the arrival of the cleaner. When he arrived, Shaw gained access to the Club through a window. He was carrying a crowbar. He entered the bar area and noticed that the cleaner had placed his wallet on the bar. He extracted $30 from it. The cleaner walked past him. Mr Shaw jumped up and swung the crowbar at him causing injuries so severe as to result in the loss of an eye.  
     
      
    9 Shaw left the Club and joined the appellant, who had remained outside. The only proceeds of the exercise was the $30 stolen from the cleaner’s wallet. 
     
      
    10 It can be seen from the above that the Crown did not allege that the appellant was the actual perpetrator of the breaking, entering, and stealing, or the infliction of grievous bodily harm upon the victim, Mr Dennett. Nor did it allege that he was personally armed with “an offensive weapon”. In order to fix the appellant with liability for these acts, all of which it attributed to Shaw, it relied upon the principle of joint criminal enterprise.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    11 The grounds of appeal are framed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The conviction is unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
         
        2. The learned trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty with respect to both counts in the indictment in accordance with the application of the appellant made at the close of the Crown case. 
         
         
        3. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the trial judge’s directions with respect to joint criminal enterprise in that: 
         
         
          
          (a) the trial judge directed the jury to the effect that the appellant was liable for acts committed by the co-offender which were not contemplated by the appellant; and 
           
           
          (b) the trial judge failed to direct the jury that the appellant must have contemplated that the co-offender would inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim with the requisite intent. 
          
         
         
        4. The learned sentencing judge erred in sentencing the appellant on the basis that he had been convicted of the offence of specially aggravated break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(3), Crimes Act, 1900. 
         
         
        5. The learned sentencing judge failed to give effect to the mitigatory circumstances relevant to the sentence to be imposed on the appellant.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown concession 
       
      
    12 The Crown concession is not directly related to any of the grounds of appeal against conviction. I will therefore deal with it as a separate issue. The back of the indictment contains the following note: 
     
      
       
       “INDICTMENT 
       
       
       for 
       
       
      Specially aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable offence 
       
       
      (Stealing/company/offensive weapon/inflict GBH) 
       
       
      Aggravated break, enter and commit serious indictable office 
       
       
      (Stealing/company) 
       
       
      Act No 40 of 1900 S.112(3), S.112(2) 
       
       
      …” 
       
      
    13 That is, the first count on the indictment purported to have been brought under s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900; a second, alternative, count was brought under s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Section 112 of the Crimes Act is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        112 Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence  
         
          
          (1) Whosoever:  
           
            
            breaks and enters any … pavilion … and commits any serious indictable offence therein … shall be liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.  
            
           
          (2)  
          Aggravated offence 
           A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) in circumstances of aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.  
           
          (3)  
          Specially aggravated offence 
           A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (2) in circumstances of special aggravation. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 “Circumstances of aggravation” and “circumstances of special aggravation” are defined in s 105A of the Crimes Act, relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “105A(1) … 
         
         
        ’ 
        circumstances of aggravation 
        ’ means circumstances involving any one or more of the following:  
         
         
        (a) the alleged offender is armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument; 
         
         
        (b) the alleged offender is in the company of another person or persons; 
         
         
        (c) the alleged offender uses corporal violence on any person;  
         
         
        (d) the alleged offender maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on any person; 
         
         
        (e) the alleged offender deprives any person of his or her liberty; 
         
         
        (f) the alleged offender knows that there is a person, or that there are persons, in the place where the offence is alleged to be committed.  
         
         
        ‘ 
        circumstances of special aggravation 
        ’ means circumstances involving either or both of the following:  
         
         
        (a) the alleged offender wounds or maliciously inflicts grievous bodily harm on any person; 
         
         
        (b) the alleged offender is armed with a dangerous weapon.” 
        
       
      
    15 A “serious indictable offence” is defined in s 4 as an indictable offence that is punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more; by s 117 the offence of larceny (stealing) is punishable by imprisonment for 5 years. It is therefore a “serious indictable offence”. A “dangerous weapon” is defined in s 4 as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a firearm (within the meaning of the  
        Firearms Act 1996 
        ), or  
         
         (b) a prohibited weapon within the meaning of the  
        Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 
        , or  
         
         (c) a spear gun.” 
        
       
      
    16 An “offensive weapon or instrument” is defined as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) a dangerous weapon, or  
         
         (b) any thing that is made or adapted for offensive purposes, or  
         
         (c) any thing that, in the circumstances, is used, intended for use or threatened to be used for offensive purposes, whether or not it is ordinarily used for offensive purposes or is capable of causing harm.” 
        
       
      
    17 The trial proceeded on the basis that count 1A was an allegation of the specially aggravated offence. This is apparent, if from nothing else, from the opening remarks on sentence of the judge, in which he stated that the maximum penalty applicable to that offence was imprisonment for 25 years.  
     
      
    18 However, in two respects the allegation in the indictment was deficient to allege that offence. Firstly, it contained no allegation that the grievous bodily harm (which was undoubtedly inflicted upon Mr Dennett by Shaw) was inflicted “maliciously”; and it contained an allegation that Shaw was armed with “an offensive weapon” rather than a “dangerous weapon” as is required in order for the offence to qualify as a “specially aggravated” instance of the s 112 offence. 
     
      
    19 Moreover, the crowbar with which Shaw was armed and with which he injured Mr Dennett could not, on the evidence, come within the definition of “dangerous weapon” even if that had been properly pleaded; and no directions were given or sought as to the meaning of the word “maliciously”. 
     
      
    20 It is for these reasons that the Crown concedes that the conviction for the specially aggravated offence cannot stand. 
     
      
    21 However, the Crown contends that it is open to this Court to substitute a verdict of guilty of the alternative offence which, by reason of the allegation that the appellant was in company, is an allegation of the aggravated offence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    22 Before proceeding further with this aspect of the matter, it is appropriate to return to the first of the grounds of appeal advanced on behalf of the appellant. That is because, if the first and/or second ground is or are successful, the appellant would be entitled to an acquittal, and there would be no basis for substituting a verdict of guilty on the alternative count, since the defect alleged applies equally to that count. If both grounds fail, but the third grounds succeeds, the appellant will be entitled to an order for a new trial. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 2 
       
      
    23 Both of the parties argued these grounds together, and, since they involve essentially the same issues, I will also deal with them that way. 
     
      
    24 The point taken is a relatively simple one, but involves legal principles dating back at least to 1827 – and never, so far as appears, doubted. It is that the Crown was unable to produce any evidence of “breaking” such as to fix either Shaw or the appellant with guilt of the offence of break, enter and commit a serious indictable offence. 
     
      
    25 The Crimes Act contains no definition of the word “break”. Examination of the case law shows that fine distinctions have been drawn between what does, and what does not, constitute “breaking” for the purposes of the section. The list may be illustrated by reference to Mr Peter Gillies’ 1985 text “Criminal Law” published by the Law Book Company Ltd in 1985. Mr Gillies states (at p 403) the following propositions: 
     
      
       
        
        “An actual breaking requires, broadly, that [the accused] interfere with the building’s physical security, in a recognised way.” 
        
       
      
    26 The learned author then proceeds to illustrate the circumstances in which “breaking” is, or is not, established. These are: 
     
      
       
      1. “To obtain entry by prising open a locked door or window (or indeed to cut through a wall, or otherwise destroy part of it) constitutes a breaking.” 
       
       
      2. “… to open a shut, but not locked door, or window is a breaking.” 
       
       
      3. “To fully open a partly opened window which is secured by a fastening device, as in the instance of a casement window, is a breaking.” 
       
       
      4. “To further open an already open window not so secured, or a door which is ajar, is not a breaking.”  
      (italics added) 
       
       
      5. “Where [an accused] obtains entry into premises by a trick on a person within, or intimidation of that person, [the accused] is deemed by the law to have committed a breaking, which concept may be referred to as constructive breaking.” 
       
       
      6. “It has been held that where, for the purposes of entrapment, a person in possession of premises opens the door so as to permit [the accused] to enter, [the accused] does not break and enter within the meaning of the criminal law.” 
       
       
      7. “Where, … [an accused is given a key to premises by the servant of the owner, who is] acting for the purposes of entrapping [the accused], and [the accused] uses this key to enter, is has been held that [the accused] does break and enter, on the basis that [the accused] opening of the door and entry through it is not done with the consent of the owner.”

    28 A more venerable text, Hamilton & Addison: Criminal Law and Procedure NSW (6th ed, 1956, edited by C E Weigall QC and R J McKay, BA, LLB) makes reference largely to the same authorities, and states the relevant propositions similarly. In notes to what was then s 108 of the Crimes Act (making an offence of burglary) the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “The breaking may be actual or constructive. There is an actual breaking if the fastenings of the house are displaced. It is not necessary that anything should be actually broken. There must be a breaking of some actual part of the house ( 
        R v Davis 
        , R & R 322) not merely of an outer wall. To pick a lock, or lift a latch ( 
        R v Jordan 
        , 7 C & P 432), or turn a key is sufficient. To open a closed window by raising the sash, is a breaking:  
        R v Haines 
        , R & R 451; or raising a window which is shut down close but not fastened:  
        R v Hyams 
        , 7 C & P 441.  
        But if a window or door be already partly open, it will not be a breaking to open it further to gain entry 
        :  
        R v Smith 
        , 1 Mood 178. Obtaining admission through a chimney is burglary:  
        R v Brice 
        , R & R 450;  
        R v Brierley 
        , 18 CAR 136; but an entry through a hole in the roof left for the purpose of light is not burglary:  
        R v Spriggs 
        , 1 M & R 357. Lifting the flap of a cellar held down only by its own weight was held to be a breaking in:  
        R v Russell 
        , 1 Mood 377; but in  
        R v Callan 
        , R & R 157 the court was equally divided upon this question …” (italics added) 
        
       
      
    29 On behalf of the appellant heavy reliance was placed upon the decision in Smith, to which reference has already been made. That was a case decided in 1827. That appellant had been convicted of breaking, entering and stealing, an offence which was then a capital felony. On appeal, it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        “The house breaking (if there was one by the prisoner) was by pushing up or raising the lower lash of the parlour window, which was proved to have been at about 8 or 9 o’clock in the morning, in a close (sic) state and shut quite down, but to have been also seen about 12 o’clock at noon of the same day in an open state or raised about a couple of inches, with the prisoner very near it; but yet only so open and raised as that there was not room enough for a person to enter the house through that opening, and permit the larceny. On the evidence it was clear, that the prisoner immediately afterwards threw the sash quite up, and then having thus removed the obstruction to his entrance, entered through the enlarged aperture thus made, and committed the felony; but the jury declared their opinion to be, that the prisoner did not open the window all the way, but only raised the sash the second time.  
         
         
        The question to the opinion of the Judge was, whether the prisoner was properly convicted of the house breaking, or whether he should have been convicted of larceny only? 
         
         
        … The Judges met, and all thought there was no decision under which this could be held to be a breaking …and that the conviction for house breaking was, therefore, wrong.” 
        
       
      
    30 Reliance was also placed upon the decision in Johnson and Jones, to which reference has also already been made, and which was decided in 1841. That was a case in which a servant, aware of the intention of two accused to steal from his master, arranged to allow them entry to the premises during the master’s absence, but promptly alerted police to the intention; he allowed them entry in order to facilitate their arrest. The court held that the prisoners entered a door which was lawfully open and there was therefore no such breaking as to constitute the crime of burglary.  
     
      
    31 These cases are of longstanding authority and this court has not been directed to any decision which has doubted their correctness, notwithstanding what I have described as the fine distinctions which have emerged. Having stated the relevant legal principles, it is necessary now to examine the evidence relevant to the issue of “breaking”. 
     
      
    32 The evidence relevant to this issue was principally that of Shaw who had pleaded guilty. In the circumstances I consider it appropriate to extract, from the transcript, all relevant portions of the evidence. 
     
      
    33 When asked how the arrangement was developed, Shaw said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was Andrew [the appellant] and I discussing it and he said that the two barmen in the club were cleaners, did so many days each, that they had keys to the safe and that and he said he could leave a window open and we could get in, get the cleaner, get the keys, get the safe, get the poker machine money and all that.” (AB 471) 
        
       
       
      When asked again how it was intended that he would gain entry to the Club, he said: 
       
       
        
        “Through a window that had been left open.” 
        
       
       
      And when asked how he knew the window had been left open, he said: 
       
       
        
        “Andrew had told me he’d made sure it was open.” (AB 481) 
        
       
       
      And when asked specifically if the appellant had said anything during the course of that evening about whether or not the window was in fact open, he said: 
       
       
        
        “He said he’d checked and it was open, unlocked.” (AB 482) 
        
       
      
    34 I now extract some questions and answers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And what did getting through the window entail? 
         
        A. Getting up on the gas cylinders that were just underneath it, sliding the window open and climbing through on top of some lockers. 
         
         
        Q. And in due course is that what you did? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. From … a position standing on the gas cylinders were you then able to reach the window? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And once you got to that position standing on the gas cylinders did you observe anything about whether the window was open or closed? 
         
        A. It looked like it was closed but as soon as I put my hand on it and slid it it just slid straight open. 
         
         
        Q. It appeared to be predominantly closed but wasn’t in fact locked closed, is that the position? 
         
        A. Yes, yep. (AB 485) 
         
         
        … 
         
         
          
        … Is it the position that when you made a statement to the police about the matter you said it – you dealt with it in these terms, that the window was slightly ajar and unlocked and you then climbed through that window? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And is that your recollection? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Slightly ajar and unlocked. Did you need to or did you use the crowbar in any way to force the window? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. And I think at another point you said this to the police when being asked about it it was put to you ‘the window was already open was it?’ and you said ‘yes, it was open a little bit and I just slid it open and I climbed in.’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And again you agree that that’s the truth? 
         
        A. Yep.” 
         (AB 502) (italics added) 
        
       
      
    35 At the conclusion of the Crown case trial counsel for the appellant sought a verdict of not guilty by direction (in respect of both counts) by reason of the deficiencies in the Crown proof of a breaking. Particularly from the italicised passages (elicited by the Crown in a leading fashion) it was clear that Shaw had done no more than further open a window that was already partly open – precisely the circumstance that, it was held in Smith, does not constitute a breaking.  
     
      
    36 After considerable discussion, leave was granted to the Crown, unopposed, to amend each count by substituting the words “on or about 1 November” for the words “on 1 November”. This was because all involved appeared to be of the view that there was evidence that it was in fact the appellant who had opened the window on the previous evening. The argument that took place was as to whether this was sufficient to constitute a “breaking” for the purposes of the offence prescribed by the section; counsel for the appellant argued strongly that the section required a greater degree of temporal propinquity in order to qualify as a “breaking” in association with the “entering and stealing”. 
     
      
    37 Closer examination of the passages extracted above however, shows that the evidence of Shaw was not capable of establishing that it was he who had opened the window. At most, Shaw said that the appellant told him that he “would make sure that it was open”. There was no evidence that it was the appellant who had actually opened it. The argument about remoteness in time was therefore misconceived or involvement. It is because of the absence of identification of the individual who opened the window that the decision in Johnson and Jones become relevant. In the evidence, it may have been opened by somebody with lawful authority to do so – whether or not to facilitate a criminal endeavour. 
     
      
    38 The appeal must be decided on the basis that Shaw further opened an already partly opened window; if Smith is good law for 21st century NSW, the appeal must be allowed. 
     
      
    39 Strictly speaking, Smith may not be binding on this Court. The Court was not, initially, referred to any other binding authority in this jurisdiction which adopts Smith. Accordingly, the Court requested the further assistance of counsel. The best that could be provided was a decision of this Court in R v Sing [2002] NSWCCA 20; 54 NSWLR 31. There Hodgson JA, with whom Levine and Howie JJ agreed, dealt with a submission that an actual or constructive breaking is only demonstrated: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where the security of a house is infringed, and that it was not a breaking to further open a door or window which was partly open …” 
        
       
      
    40 Counsel in that case therefore criticised a direction that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… any unlawful entry will constitute a breaking and entering.” 
        
       
      
    41 This Court did not directly deal with the submission, although it did appear to accept the proposition. Hodgson JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Had a direction to that effect been sought below, there is no reason to suppose that a correct direction would not have been given.” 
        
       
      
    42 The Court then proceeded to dispose of that ground of appeal on the basis that, even had a correct direction been given, it was unlikely that the result would not have been any different. 
     
      
    43 Smith was not cited as authority in Sing. A Western Australian decision in R v Galea (1989) 46 A Crim R 158 was cited. In that case criticism was made of a trial judge who failed to direct a jury that breaking would not be established if they accepted that defendant’s evidence that the door of the dwelling house was ajar and that he merely opened it further. The Western Australian Court of Criminal Appeal accepted that argument. 
     
      
    44 Whether or not Smith binds the Court, however, the distinctions outlined above, and the authorities, including Smith, have been taught to generations of law students in NSW as representing the law to be applied in this State and have appeared in criminal law textbooks as having established legal principle; no doubt has, so far as the researches of counsel show, ever been cast upon them. I consider it inappropriate for this Court to depart from the application of such longstanding and accepted authority. 
     
      
    45 Accordingly, on the evidence, the appellant could not have been convicted of an offence which incorporated the element of “breaking”. 
     
      
    46 The result is that the verdict of guilty must be quashed and a verdict of acquittal entered. The appellant could not be convicted of the alternative charge because it includes the same element. 
     
      
    47 I would add, however, that I see no useful purpose to be served by perpetuation of the fine distinctions which have been set out above. It hardly accords with the modern approach to criminal law to regard a breaking (as identified in the authorities) as criminal, while taking advantage of a partly ajar door or window does not constitute a breaking. Any entry to domestic or business premises for the purpose of committing criminal offences ought to be subject to the same criminal sanctions. Perhaps it is time s 112 attracted the attention of law reformers. In that context I would add this. Both charges were brought under s 112. I will set out the relevant parts of that section: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        112 Breaking etc into any house etc and committing serious indictable offence  
         
          
          (1) Whosoever:  
           
            
            breaks and enters any dwelling-house, or any building within the curtilage of any dwelling-house and occupied therewith but not being part thereof, or any school-house, shop, warehouse, or counting-house, office, store, garage, pavilion, factory, or workshop, or any building belonging to His Majesty or to any Government department, or to any municipal or other public authority, and commits any serious indictable offence therein … shall be liable to imprisonment for fourteen years.”  
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    48 From the catalogue of buildings the breaking and entering of which is forbidden by s 112, the prosecution chose to identify, as the subject of the offence charged against the appellant, a “pavilion”. This, it appears, is what the prosecution perceived as the nearest of that catalogue to a recreational club. If the Sawtell Bowling and Recreation Club was not a pavilion, then breaking and entering it was, whatever else it might have been, not an offence against s 112. I have serious doubts whether it could properly be regarded as a “pavilion”. 
     
      
    49 It appears that no club, or perhaps hotel, or perhaps many other kinds of building which do not presently spring to mind can rely upon the criminal offence created by s 112. This is another matter that might attract the attention of law reform authorities. 
     
      
    50 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      (2) Conviction quashed; 
       
       
      (3) Verdict of acquittal entered.

    JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing two people who were both involved in crimes which were committed on the night of 10 and 11 July 2006. 2. Crystal Mares is charged with aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence - larceny - on 10 July 2006. The aggravation is that she was in company at the time. She is also charged with demanding property in company with menaces with intent to steal on the same date. The first offence is against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The second offence is against s 99(2) of the Crimes Act. 3. Arising out of the same circumstances Mr Michael Middleton was charged with aggravated enter a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely demanding property with menaces and with stealing in a dwelling house. The first is an offence against s 111(2) of the Crimes Act. The second is an offence against s 148 of the Crimes Act.4. Briefly what happened is this. Ms Mares met the victim of this offence, a man named Terrence O’Sullivan, in January 2006. Over the next four or five months they saw one another. During that period of time Mr O’Sullivan paid Ms Mares a large sum of money, paid over various stages and all at her request.5. On the night of 10 July 2006 Mr O’Sullivan got home from work. He received a phone call from Ms Mares. She asked if he was home and he said that he was. She said that she would come to his address in Emu Plains. A short time later he heard a knock on his front door. He began to turn the lock when the door was pushed open causing him to stumble backwards. 6. Three men entered his premises with Ms Mares behind them. She said to him “I’m angry with you”. She said to the men to take whatever they wanted. She said to Mr O’Sullivan “You know what I want, I want money”. The three men began to ransack the place. They took a picnic table, a whipper snipper, a vacuum cleaner, a television, drinks, a DVD player and DVDs and money. They took them out to a four-wheel drive which was waiting outside.7. Ms Mares then said to Mr O’Sullivan “I want $20,000 and I want it by Wednesday”. The day that she said it was a Monday. She said she didn’t want to hear the wrong answer. She said “I have got two car loads of people at your mother’s place, do you want me to send them in and shoot your mother now?” She repeated that she wanted the $20,000 by Wednesday and did not care how and where he got it. She warned him away from reporting the matter to the police.8. The four then left the premises. One of the three men was Ms Mares' co-offender Michael Middleton. 9. Mr O’Sullivan, very sensibly went to get his mother and they both reported the matter to the police.10. Ms Mares was interviewed after being arrested on 11 July 2006. She admitted to the offences. She said she’d organised the men to attend in order to obtain the money from Mr O’Sullivan. She said that on the way she became aware that one of the men was armed with a firearm. She saw the gun. She had offered to pay each man a $1,000 to act as physical support for her demands.11. Mr Middleton was not located as quickly. Police used investigative methods involving his mobile phone and a DNA profile and eventually located him on 21 December 2006. He voluntarily attended the police station on 22 December 2006 where he was arrested. He also was interviewed. He said he was contacted by Ms Mares who asked that he help recover money. He was to provide a presence to intimidate the proposed victim. He said that he had guarded the victim whilst the other men ransacked his home. He made sure the victim did not move.12. That is a bare outline of the events which led to Ms Mares being charged with her two crimes and Mr Middleton being charged with his two crimes. In order to proceed with sentencing both of them I need to consider their roles separately. I first consider Ms Mares. 13. I make reference to two general headings. The first is that I consider the general seriousness of the crimes which she has committed. The second heading is that I consider her own personal circumstances.14. Looking first at the general seriousness of the crimes which she has committed, the starting point is always the penalty which is attached to crimes by Parliament. In this case the more serious offence of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. Not only that, but Parliament has fixed to that a standard non-parole period of five years. The offence of demanding property in company with menaces with intent to steal carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. In other words both the crimes committed by Ms Mares are clearly regarded by Parliament as very serious offences and for good reason. 15. The second factor which I take into account in assessing how serious these crimes were are whether it was planned and organised or whether it was spontaneous. In this case the evidence leaves me in no doubt that it was planned and organised. Ms Mares had known the victim for some months. The plan itself may have been of short duration - perhaps a matter of hours or a day or so - but in that time she organised support and made contact with the victim. She had transport and turned up at his house.16. The next factor which I will take into account is that Ms Mares knew that one of the men had a firearm. I accept the submissions of Mr Shridhar that the source of that information came entirely from his client. The victim at no stage was shown the firearm. It was not brandished in his presence. That would have been more serious. Nevertheless it is, in my opinion, a significantly aggravating feature that Ms Mares was prepared to undertake this exercise knowing that one of the men was armed. It considerably heightened the risk of very serious injury or death occurring as a possibility. It was a very dangerous thing to do. It aggravates the offence.17. I take into account the fact that Ms Mares knew that the person whose house she was breaking and entering and from which she was stealing was at home at the time. I do not regard that as aggravating had the victim not been on notice. As Mr Shridhar said, the purpose of the exercise was to confront Mr O’Sullivan and to demand money from him. In a sense the criminality in that behaviour is captured by the offence of demanding money with menaces.18. Ms Mares has a history of drug abuse. I will refer to that again but I mention it at this stage because whilst being a drug addict does not excuse or provide a defence for crimes, it may explain crimes and may make them less serious because they are more impulsive. I do not think in this case that Ms Mares’ drug addiction has that impact. I accept the submissions of Ms Summerfield for the prosecution that the degree of planning in this case is inconsistent with a significant impact on the objective seriousness of the offence brought about by the drug addiction.19. I take into account the nature of the property stolen. It could have been a lot worse but no doubt for Mr O’Sullivan it was a very aggravating and annoying experience and I am here referring simply to the fact that he was deprived of his property. The experience overall must have been shocking for him.20. I also take into account, as Ms Summerfield says, that the purpose of sentencing of deterring other people from committing these crimes is important in a case such as this. There are instances of home invasion which occur in Sydney and it is important that sentences deter people from undertaking this sort of crime.21. I turn now to Ms Mares’ personal considerations. She pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Ms Summerfield concedes as much. She has a criminal record. The criminal record contains crimes such as assault and maliciously damaging property as well as larceny and entering a building. This criminal record means that Ms Mares does not have the benefit, which other people might have, of being able to claim that she is of good character or has committed an offence or offences for the first time. It deprives her of that benefit.22. She was born on 17 June 1985. She was twenty-one when these offences occurred and is twenty-two now. I have read her pre-sentence report which became exhibit C. It records that she has had a good relationship with her sister and mother but that she was raised in an environment of violence due to alcohol abuse within the family. She left school at fourteen and did not do any further education for the workforce. She has been employed sporadically. 23. She commenced on alcohol and cannabis during early adolescence. She started using heroin at the age of fifteen and later started using methylamphetamines. She had not, at the time of the report, completed any drug counselling or intervention. She also gambles to unhealthy extent. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and takes medication. 24. She was referred to a drug and alcohol program in custody but withdrew after a day and she has two internal charges to do with possessing prohibited goods and failing to supply a urine sample.25. There is a report by Dr Nielssen dated 26 November 2006 concerning Ms Mares. Dr Nielssen is a psychiatrist. He diagnoses substance dependence and abuse as well as a substance-induced psychotic state and what he describes as an unstable personality. He said that at the time of the offences she was in a disturbed state of mind as a result of a combination of drug use and disorganised thinking. As I said, I do not regard the impact of that as very significant on the seriousness of the crime because she was clearly able to plan and organise its execution.26. She was also seen by a psychologist Mr W John Taylor. Mr Taylor assessed a moderate risk of recidivism. He said that her rehabilitation would depend heavily on the measures that can be undertaken to address her needs. He said that she will need considerable support as well as ongoing psychological treatment when she has been released from prison. He thought that she would need to receive treatment for at least a couple of years.27. She has demonstrated some contrition in confessing to her crimes although the Crown case against her, it seems, must have been fairly strong since she knew the victim, although her confession itself needs to be taken into account.28. Because of the standard non-parole period attached to the principal offence that she has been charged with I need to ask myself the question: are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period? In this case the standard non-parole period is five years. In answering the question I consider the objective seriousness of the offence, that is how serious the crime is, as well as circumstances of aggravation.29. I have considered those matters. I regard this case as being comfortably in the middle range of objective seriousness. That is because of, in particular, the knowledge of the weapon and the degree of planning. The degree of planning is probably the more prominent feature which puts it into the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 30. However there is, or remains, a reason for not imposing the standard non-parole period. That is because the standard non-parole period is a starting point for a conviction after a trial. In this case Ms Mares pleaded guilty; she is entitled to a discount for that. That is a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period and I will take that into account in due course.31. The final matter which I consider concerning Ms Mares is whether there are special circumstances which will justify adjusting the proportion between the non-parole period and the parole period of her sentence. I think there are special circumstances. There are three: this is her first time in custody, she is aged twenty-two and she needs a good deal of supervision in the community to encourage her rehabilitation. 32. I will now turn to Mr Middleton’s behaviour. Once again I consider the seriousness of his crimes and then I will consider personal considerations. 33. The seriousness of his crimes are indicated at first, as I said previously, by the maximum penalties which are attached to the aggravated entering in company. Parliament has fixed a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. To the stealing in a dwelling house Parliament has fixed a maximum of seven years imprisonment. It can be immediately seen, for example, that his crimes are regarded by Parliament as less serious than Ms Mares’ crimes. 34. I regard the crimes committed by Mr Middleton as being planned. He was not the initiator of the plan but nor was it a spontaneous crime committed on the spur of the moment. He was recruited by Ms Mares and agreed to participate knowing that his role would be to provide physical intimidation. He was there, as he said, for “show”.35. I take into account that he knew that the victim was at home at the time although that of course was the very purpose for him participating in the criminal activity. 36. Perhaps most significant is the fact that Mr Middleton was on parole when he committed these offences. He had been released to parole about a month before these crimes. When people are paroled or granted bail the criminal justice system allows them liberty to go into the community. It does this at some risk to the community because people on parole or on bail may commit further offences. When they do then they abuse the trust which was granted to them. It is regarded by the authorities as a significantly aggravating feature and I also regard it as such. 37. I also take into account the need for the sentence to reflect a general deterrence to prevent other people from committing similar crimes.38. Mr Middleton also pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He also has a criminal record which includes offences such as larceny and assault and stealing from the person. That, like for Ms Mares, means that he does not have the benefit of a clean slate, so to speak; he does not receive any mitigation or discount because of a good record.39. His prospects of rehabilitation must be guarded. His pre-sentence report points out that he has no social support network in the community. He has a six year old daughter who lives in the Northern Territory with her mother. His longest period of employment, since leaving school, was for a couple of weeks as a tyre fitter. He has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and has medication. 40. He has a long history of drug abuse which includes cannabis, heroin and amphetamines. This dates back to his early teenage years. 41. The pre-sentence report notes that he seems enthusiastic about making a positive lifestyle change but guardedly also notes that that is yet to be tested. It thought he was unlikely to benefit from supervision because of a history of not adhering to instruction and guidance from the Probation and Parole Service.42. He too has been assessed by a psychologist. Ms Anita Duffy assessed him. She recorded a history of an unstable home life and also a period, during his childhood, when he became the victim of unwanted attention by older men who preyed on him and other young boys. Ms Duffy thought that Mr Middleton needed continued monitoring of his psychiatric condition and his medication. She noted that he was unwilling to enter into any counselling programs to address his personal issues.43. Mr Middleton was assessed by a psychiatrist, Dr Rosalie Wilcox. She reported on 7 November 2007. She diagnosed paranoid schizophrenia and poly-substance abuse as well as an anti-social personality disorder. She noted that he had expressed considerable remorse and had taken responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty. She noted a motivation to make significant changes to his life and expressed a desire to participate in long-term drug rehabilitation. She noted that he knew that unless he maintains abstinence from drugs he would have difficulty gaining access to and becoming reunited with his daughter. 44. It seems therefore that the prospects of his rehabilitation are not clear. There has been some improvement in his motivation in recent months and I take that into account.45. Finally for Mr Middleton I am invited by Ms Woodhurst to find that there are special circumstances in his case which would warrant the adjustment of the ratio. She points to his mental health issues and the need for rehabilitation focusing on the difficulty which he experienced in his upbringing.46. Ms Summerfield submits that he has had opportunities in the past for rehabilitation which he has not taken and that the indications are not positive for rehabilitation, that he is not motivated.47. I do propose to adjust the ratio because of the recent expressions of motivation, although I do not propose to adjust the ratio as significantly as I will for Ms Mares. 48. I take into account that he has demonstrated contrition. He has been in custody since 22 December 2006. 49. In each case of Mr Middleton and Ms Mares there is a possibility, because they are both in protective custody, that there might be some restriction on their ability to participate in courses although the evidence is not strong.50. In the case of Ms Mares, as I say I regard her case as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Were her case to have been a conviction or a verdict following a trial it would attract the standard non-parole period of five years but she has pleaded guilty and is entitled to a discount because of that plea. That is a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period. I would regard an appropriate discount as the maximum of twenty-five percent which would bring her non-parole period down to the region of about three and three quarter years. 51. As a result of the special circumstances, on one view of things I might further reduce that non-parole period although I am wary of not reducing it too much. The reason for that is that the standard non-parole period must remain as a guidepost or indicator as to how serious the legislature regards this penalty.52. In the end I have determined to fix a non-parole period for Ms Mares of three years. It will commence on the date of her arrest of 11 July 2006 and expire on 10 July 2009. I have decided to fix an overall sentence of six years. The parole period of three years therefore reflects a significant adjustment in her favour. I have deliberately allowed a period of three years parole for her to take the most advantage of opportunities for her rehabilitation.53. As for the demand money with menaces I will fix a sentence that is concurrent with the sentence I have just fixed because it arose out of the same circumstances and was part of the same criminal episode. I regard a sentence of three years as appropriate. I will not fix a non-parole period because that sentence will be the same length as the non-parole period for the other sentence.54. Turning now to Mr Middleton’s case I regard an appropriate sentence for his aggravated entry in a dwelling with intent as three years. I will fix a non-parole period of one year and ten months. The balance of the term is therefore one year and two months. Once again I have exercised my discretion, having found special circumstances, to adjust the proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of the term.55. For the offence of stealing property in a dwelling I fix a penalty of twelve months. Each of those sentences will date from 22 December 2006.56. So I will now formally sentence you. Ms Mares, if you would stand up. Ms Mares, for the aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence I sentence you to six years imprisonment. That will date from 11 July 2006 and expire on 10 July 2012. I fix a non-parole period of three years. That starts on 11 July 2006, when you were arrested and will expire on 10 July 2009. I fix a balance of the term of three years. That commences on 11 July 2009 and expires on 10 July 2012.57. For the offence of demanding money with menaces I set a fixed term of three years commencing 11 July 2006 and expiring on 10 July 2009. You can have a seat.58. Mr Middleton, for the offence of aggravated entering of building with intent I sentence you to imprisonment for three years. That is to commence on 22 December 2006 and expire on 21 December 2009. I fix a non-parole period of one year and ten months. That is to commence on 22 December 2006 and to expire on 21 October 2008. I fix a balance of the term of one year and two months to commence on 22 October 2008 and to expire on 21 December 2009.59. For the offence of stealing property in a dwelling I sentence you to twelve months imprisonment to commence on 22 December 2006 and to expire on 21 December 2007. If you would have a seat. 60. In Mr Middleton’s case I order that Mr Middleton be released on parole on 21 October 2008. I fix the following conditions of his parole: he is to appear in court when called upon to do so, he is notify the court of any change of his address, he is to be of good behaviour and he is to accept all reasonable directions and recommendations of the Probation and Parole Service. HIS HONOUR: Now, in a moment I will, in compliance with s 48, make sure that each of the offenders understands the sentence but before I do that are there any orders which I haven’t made and ought to make, Ms Summerfield?SUMMERFIELD: Not that I believe your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes there are?SUMMERFIELD: There are no further orders your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay. Now Ms Woodhurst?WOODHURST: None your Honour.HIS HONOUR: And Mr Shridhar?SHRIDHAR: No your Honour.61. Now Ms Mares, for the more serious crime - I’ve got to make sure you understand your sentence because I know it’s difficult following all that. Perhaps it is. I’ve given you six years for the major crime. I have divided that in half. Your non-parole period is three years, you’ve got the benefit of - normally it would be three quarters of six years but I’ve given you half of six years because I’ve accepted what Mr Shridhar says about that. You have got to serve your gaol sentence from 11 July 06, when you were arrested halfway through last year and your minimum of three years expires on 10 July 2009, so you’re about halfway through it and you’ll be eligible for parole on 10 July 2009. Whether you get it or not depends on the Parole Authority. They have to be satisfied that you can be released. It’s up to them not to me. Once you are released on parole you’ve got a balance of the sentence of another three years and that expires on 10 July 2012 so your overall sentence is six, half in gaol and half in out provided you get parole from the Parole Authority. For the other one, demand money I have just fixed a sentence of three years to date from July last year which will finish at the same time as you become eligible for parole on the first one. Do you understand that?OFFENDER MARES: Yes sir.62. Now Mr Middleton, your case is different. Your crimes were less serious as I said and I’ve given you an overall sentence of three years. That also dates from when you were arrested, in your case on 22 July (as said) 2006. I have given you a minimum time that you have to serve in gaol of one year and ten months, that is 22 months. That starts on 22 December 2006 and you will be paroled on 21 October 2008 so 21 October next year you will be paroled. Because your sentence is three years or less, three years in your case, I am the one who orders parole not the Parole Authority so I have ordered parole for you and you will be paroled on 21 October 2008. But once you are paroled you’ve still got the rest of your sentence to serve, one year and two months. You’ll be in the community but if you misbehave then you’re back in, as you well know, and you serve out the balance of the parole. For the other one, stealing of property, I’ve just fixed 12 months to date from when you were arrested and that will expire in a week or two’s time. I fixed parole conditions for you. You’ve got to behave yourself, you’ve got to tell the court of changes of address, you’ve got to come to court if you’re ordered to and perhaps, most importantly, you’ve got to accept reasonable recommendations for your rehabilitation from the Probation Service and that’s to help you get back on track. Do you understand those orders?OFFENDER MIDDLETON: Yes I do, thank you very much.HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else, Mr Shridhar?SHRIDHAR: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Anything else, Ms Woodhurst?WOODHURST: Nothing further.HIS HONOUR: And Ms Summerfield?SUMMERFIELD: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Can I thank you all for your assistance, the legal practitioners and I acknowledge that it’s late, it’s 25 to 5 so I thank the staff who have stayed on for this.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Raad Fajloun has applied for bail. He was convicted by a jury last month of two serious offences involving invading his wife’s unit and kidnapping and holding her. Bail was not applied for after the conviction and he has been in custody since then.2. Today through his counsel, Dr Webb, he applies for bail. A number of bases are put. One basis concerns the need for further psychiatric assessment and, on the bail application, a report by Dr Stephen Allnutt dated 12 December 2007 was tendered. Dr Allnutt does raise the question of doubts about Mr Raad Fajloun’s mental state. However, he was not in a position to provide a firm conclusion. For that reason I vacated today’s hearing date for the sentence proceedings.3. Dr Webb submits that the obtaining of further psychiatric evidence will be facilitated by his client being in the community rather than in custody. That may be true, but arrangements have already been made for Dr Allnutt to see Mr Raad Fajloun in custody and Dr Allnutt, as a self-described forensic psychiatrist, would be, I am satisfied, in a position to see a person who is a prisoner in a Corrective Services facility. 4. Dr Webb emphasised his community ties. They are indeed of some substance. He has many family ties. 5. Opposing bail Ms Herbert, for the Crown, points to a flight risk and to the security of the victim of the offence. The victim of the offence was Mr Fajloun’s wife. Dr Webb - returning briefly to his submissions - indicated that the crime was a very specific one so that there should not be a general concern for Mr Raad Fajloun’s behaviour in the community. However, it appears that security arrangements for the victim of the crime have been changed as a result of Mr Raad Fajloun being in custody. The victim’s circumstances are no longer as secure as they formerly were.6. It seems to me likely, although I say that cautiously only because I have not heard submissions, that Mr Raad Fajloun will face a period of full-time custody as a result of his convictions. Dr Webb on his behalf acknowledged realistically that likelihood.7. Mr Raad Fajloun is therefore in a position where he has been convicted by a jury of two very serious offences and is likely to face a custodial sentence. The preparation of his case on sentence will not be prejudiced by the fact that he is in custody and the strength of his community ties does not alone warrant the granting of bail in a case such as this.8. I therefore for those reasons reject the application.

    JUDGMENT1. Aaron Potger is a young man who while on parole for a previous armed robbery held up three people with a syringe and stole property from them. He therefore faces court again for armed robbery. The question in this case is to what extent the guideline judgment, delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, applies to this case. 
    2. Briefly this is what Mr Potger did. It was a Saturday night. It was 3 February 2007. Just two months earlier, on 7 November 2006, Mr Potger was released on parole from a previous sentence for armed robbery. At 7.45 that night he got on a train at Seven Hills Railway Station. Three other people were already on the train. Mr Potger sat near them. He pulled the hood of his jacket over his head, then approached the three people and said “I’ve got Hep B, give me all your fucking money”. 
    3. The agreed facts, which are part of exhibit A, say that at the time Mr Potger held two syringes in his left hand and a nailfile in his right hand. Mr Potger gave evidence yesterday that he held one syringe and a nailfile. In addition I note that the indictment listing the charge refers to one syringe. I find that Mr Potger held one, not two, syringes. 
    4. Getting back to what happened on the train, the three people handed over their property. It included a wallet, cash, mobile phones, bracelets, watches and cigarettes. It included personal papers and drivers licences. Mr Potger left the train saying “Don’t follow me or tell the police or I’ll kill you”.  
    5. He was picked up by closed-circuit TV when he left the train and was arrested a few days later. He agreed that he was the person who was on the video footage but otherwise declined to answer any questions which, of course, was his entitlement. 
    6. I have taken evidence in this matter in the form of exhibit A, which was tendered by the Crown, which I have read, comprising various documents and Mr Potger’s criminal history, exhibit B, which is a presentence report and exhibit 1 a report by a psychologist dated 6 June 2006 tendered to give me information about Mr Potger’s background. 
    7. In addition Mr Potger himself gave evidence under oath before me yesterday. I do not propose to review that evidence but I make the following findings.  
    8. First, I need to make an assessment of how serious this offence was. A number of factors are relevant. The first is that this offence of armed robbery has attached to it, by Parliament, a maximum sentence of twenty years gaol. That is fixed by s97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. 
    9. Secondly, Mr Potger’s weapon was a syringe. He claimed at the time that a wound with a syringe would leave the wounded person with hepatitis B. To my mind that is, or must have been, a particularly terrifying experience for the victims. Mr Potger himself acknowledged as much. I regard the particular weapon in this case as an aggravating factor. 
    10. Next, there were three victims not one.  
    11. Perhaps the most significant aspect of the offence which makes it serious is the fact that it was committed whilst Mr Potger was on parole for a previous armed robbery. Parole is an opportunity given by the courts for an offender to be at liberty whilst they are serving their prison sentence so that they can undertake rehabilitation. The higher courts have made it clear that a person who abuses this liberty, whether it’s in the form of parole or bail, must expect that to be a significantly aggravating factor in the next sentence. I regard that circumstance as a particularly aggravating factor in this case. 
    12. Next there was some planning but I regard the amount of planning as quite limited.  
    13. Next, although not an aggravating factor for this offence, Mr Potger’s criminal record provides for him no opportunity for leniency. A good record, like good character, can act in a favourable way for an offender and incline a judge to reduce a sentence that the judge might otherwise have imposed. Mr Potger however has a record which includes assaults, illegal possession of knives, larceny, break and enter and of course a previous armed robbery. He can be given no additional leniency whatsoever because of that record. 
    14. It is convenient, at this stage, to refer to the guideline judgment delivered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case called Henry. The guideline judgment identified a typical armed robbery case by reference to seven elements. I will refer to those seven elements and link them to Mr Potger’s case.  
    15. The first element is that the offender is a young offender with little or no criminal history. Mr Potger is a young offender and I take that into account. However he does not have little or no criminal history. 
    16. The next factor is that the offence was committed with a weapon, like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. That applied in this case with the added aggravating feature of it appearing to be a weapon which could inflict a dangerous disease. 
    17. The third factor is a limited degree of planning. That applied in this case. 
    18. The fourth factor is limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. That applied in this case. 
    19. The fifth factor is the victim was in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver. That applied in this case because the victims were confined within a train carriage. 
    20. The next is the small amount taken. Although significant for the victims in this case the amounts taken were relatively small. 
    21. The last factor is a plea of guilty the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. Mr Potger has pleaded guilty in this case. He did not plead at the earliest opportunity, having been arrested on 7 February 2007. He was arraigned on 11 October 2007. He formally entered a plea on the hearing date of 27 October 2007 but Mr Borosh, for the Crown, very fairly indicates that he himself was made aware, at the arraignment on 11 October 2007, that the case would be a short matter. There was therefore, in this case, not a plea at the earliest opportunity but nevertheless a plea which was not made at the last opportunity. It is difficult to assess the strength of the Crown case but I note that property belonging to the victims was found either in Mr Potger’s possession or at his premises and that he admitted that he was the person on the video. 
    22. I will return to the relevance of the guideline judgement shortly. 
    23. I now turn to considerations which are personal to Mr Potger and I make the following findings. He is presently aged twenty-two having been born on 5 February 1985. To his credit, on oath yesterday, he expressed remorse for his offence and some understanding of the impact which the offence had on his victims. He had been in a relationship some years ago and his partner in that relationship suffered a miscarriage which had a negative impact on him. That is recorded in the presentence report. He left school at year nine and has been mainly unemployed since then.  
    24. He had a troubled childhood. Exhibit 1, the report of the psychologist, Emma Collins, refers to Mr Potger in the following terms, which I adopt: 
     
      
      “ 
      Mr Potger is a 21 year old Aboriginal male who has experienced significant maladjustment from childhood. This was marked by parental neglect and drug abuse in addition to what appears to be a charted onset of conduct disturbance and poor success in school. 
      ” 
       
      
      
      Evidently, when he was growing up Mr Potger was exposed to drugs by both his parents, in particular his father. He was also the subject of violence from his father. His mother has since ceased drug taking and Mr Potger maintains a good relationship with his mother but none with his father. Much of his childhood upbringing was at the hands of his grandmother because of the instability of his own home. 
       
      
    25. Mr Potger has had an alcohol problem since he was about fourteen. He has been using illegal drugs since he was about seventeen in the form of heroin and amphetamines. He commenced on cannabis even earlier. He has been on methadone for the last twelve months but had not undertaken any significant drug and alcohol programs. In addition he has a gambling problem. 
    26. Since being in custody he has three instances of institutional misconduct and he is regarded as a person with an anger management issue. His custody, whilst I mention it, is something that I will refer to now. For his previous armed robbery, not the one I am sentencing him for, he was sentenced to twenty two and a half months imprisonment. That was to conclude on 22 September 2007. He was given a twelve month non-parole period commencing on 8 November 2005, which was also the commencement of the head sentence and concluding on 7 November 2006. As I have already said, after being released on parole he committed this offence several months later. As a result of committing this offence the parole authority revoked his parole by order made on 23 February 2007. Hence he served in custody the balance of the parole for his last armed robbery. The period of custody referable to that balance of parole finished on, I will find, 22 September 2007. That is relevant because I propose to commence the sentence which I impose on 23 September 2007. 
    27. Returning to the features personal to Mr Potger, the presentence report and the psychologist’s report both emphasise the need for a high level of intervention or supervision. The presentence report concludes that he is suitable for a high level of intervention by the Probation and Parole Service with strategies to address particular identified needs relating to his criminal behaviour. I will return to those needs in specifying my sentence. 
    28. Emma Collins, the psychologist, says in paragraph 10: 
     
      
      “ 
      Whilst Mr Potger told me that he wishes to achieve long-term drug abstinence, he has consistently relapsed once he has been released from gaol. I do not think he has the current resources to maintain a drug free state without considerable support, and he will require substantial resources and supports to be implemented if he has any chance of achieving this in the near future. 
      ” 
       
       
      That report, I remind myself, was dated 6 June 2006 and was obviously before the District Court which on 19 June 2006 had sentenced Mr Potger for his previous armed robbery.  
      
    29. Mr Schrader, in his submissions, asks me to take into account the fact that his client has had a disadvantaged background and commencement in life similar to those experienced by many indigenous young men. In other words he was saying there were some issues which are common between this case and the principles applied by the courts in sentencing Aboriginal persons by reference to the case known as Fernando. I accept that submission. 
    30. Mr Schrader asks that I find special circumstances so that I can adjust the balance between the non-parole period and the parole period. He emphasises that Mr Potger has spent most of his time since the age of seventeen in custody. He refers to a risk that he could become institutionalised at a young age. He refers to the report emphasising the need for assistance in his rehabilitation. He argues that a longer than normal parole period is desirable to achieve this end. I have been referred to two cases by Mr Schrader. One is Regina v Weldon [2002] NSWCCA 308 and the other is Regina v Boney [2001] NSWCCA 432. I have read both those cases and take them into account insofar as they are relevant. 
    31. I now turn to the question of what is the appropriate sentence for Mr Potger. The guideline judgment in Henry says that for a typical case a narrow sentencing range of between four and five years for the head term, that is not the non-parole period, would be appropriate for such typical cases. It is important to emphasise here that that range takes into account the fact that offenders like Mr Potger are young and that they have pleaded guilty.  
    32. In this case I propose to select as the head term, the overall term of the sentence, five years. I do that because Mr Potger’s case falls squarely within the seven elements, specified by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Henry, but he committed this offence whilst he was on parole for a previous armed robbery and does not have the benefit of little or no criminal history. In addition there were three victims and a particularly nasty weapon although the most significant factor is the fact that he committed this offence whilst on parole. 
    33. The assessment of the non-parole period is difficult. I accept Mr Schrader’s submission that there are special circumstances in this case justifying an adjustment so that the proportion between the non-parole period and the parole period is not three to one. I originally had in mind that an appropriate proportion would be one to one, that is that there should be a non-parole period of two and a half years. The special circumstances which I do find are these. Mr Potger is a young man. There is a risk he could become institutionalised at a young age given the amount of time he has spent in prison. There is a need for a high level of supervision and intervention however I realise that if I selected two and a half years that the sentence would need to commence on 23 September 2007 after the expiration of the balance of parole for the previous armed robbery. That would mean essentially that Mr Potger’s non-parole period of two and a half years would lie largely in the future. I regard the impact of imposing this sentence at the end of a balance of parole served for the previous armed robbery as a further special circumstance and I propose to reduce the non-parole period to two years and that non-parole period is to date from 23 September 2007. 
    34. For the offence of armed robbery I sentence you to imprisonment for five years to commence on 23 September 2007 and to conclude on 22 September 2012. I fix a non-parole period of two years to commence on 23 September 2007 and to conclude on 22 September 2009. The earliest date which it appears that you will be eligible for release is 22 September 2009. I recommend to the Parole Authority, when they are considering your release on parole, that they take into account the strategies referred to in the presentence report dated 10 December 2007 to address the following four areas: anger management issues, drug and alcohol issues, mental health assessment with follow-up treatment if required and gambling issues. 
     Now Mr Borosh, Mr Velcic are there any other formal orders I need to make?BOROSH: Not from the Crown’s point of view, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No I don’t specify and I don’t order his release because it is over three years, am I right?VELCIC: That’s so your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Velcic that I need to--VELCIC: Nothing arising.35. Mr Potger, just so that you’re clear. Now I’ve given you five years for the armed robbery, do you understand? And that started on 23 September this year which is when your parole ended.OFFENDER: Parole ran out.HIS HONOUR: Yeah. I’ve chosen that because that’s what the guideline judgment in Henry says and I’ve given you the top of the range because you’ve done it before but I’ve given you two years at the bottom and that also commences on 23 September so when 22 September 09 comes around the Parole Board will consider you for release. Whether they release you or not, at that stage, is up to you and them, how you go in prison and up to them and I’ve recommended that they read that probation report and give you an opportunity to deal with some of these issues, which I’ve referred to, whilst you’re on parole. Anything that you can do whilst you’re in custody is obviously a good idea as well so that when you come up for parole perhaps you would have made a start on some of those issues. Now do you understand that, do you understand your release date?OFFENDER: The earliest I can get out is not this September, not next September - like in 20 days it’s next year, that’s 08 on not that September coming the next one.HIS HONOUR: Exactly.OFFENDER: Okay.HIS HONOUR: September 09.

    JUDGMENT1. Today I am sentencing Mr Apisai Bavadra for an armed robbery. One of the principal issues is how much the seriousness of this armed robbery, weighed against Mr Bavadra’s personal circumstances, coincide with the guideline judgment issued by the Court of Criminal Appeal for armed robberies. 
    2. What happened in this armed robbery is this. It occurred on 12 February 2007 at about 6.30 at night. Before then Mr Bavadra had been contacted by a man called Troy Robertson, an acquaintance of his. Mr Robertson told Mr Bavadra that he, Mr Robertson, needed some money and knew of a person who deals in drugs. Mr Robertson suggested that he and Mr Bavadra rob the man and take some money and drugs. Mr Bavadra agreed. 
    3. They both went to the man’s house which was a unit in Putland Street, St Marys. As it happened the man was not alone. It did turn out that the man possessed drugs in the unit. He had some amphetamines and cannabis but he was accompanied in the unit by a female friend. She was watching television and the man was washing up. They knocked on the door. The man answered the door. Mr Bavadra, when the door was opened, pushed himself in carrying a large hunting knife. The person who knocked on the door was Troy Robertson. He was known to the man in the house who, before opening the door, looked through the peephole. It was when he unlocked the door that Mr Bavadra pushed through the door armed with the knife. 
    4. Mr Bavadra said “Get on the fuckin’ lounge” to the man and said “Where’s the fuckin’ money and gear?”. Mr Bavadra pushed the man onto the lounge chair and started to go through items in the house. Together he and Mr Robertson found cannabis and amphetamines. 
    5. Mr Bavadra punched the man in the face, causing him to fall over on to the lounge. They rummaged through other rooms. They found two thousand dollars and a diamond ring. They brought the man back to the lounge room and took his wallet and house keys. 
    6. When Troy Robertson said “Let’s get out of here”, Mr Bavadra hit the man in the side of the head with the hilt of the hunting knife. He also took the handbag of the young woman who was at the unit. 
    7. About a month later, on 10 March 2007, police attended Mr Bavadra’s house. He was arrested for the crime. At the time they located about one and a half grams of cannabis in his pocket. 
    8. The presence of that cannabis formed the basis of a charge of possessing a prohibited drug under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. I have been asked by Mr Bavadra to take that offence into account under s32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 when I am sentencing him for the armed robbery and I do take that into account. 
    9. When interviewed Mr Bavadra denied the allegations. He was however shown an interview, or a transcript of an interview which Troy Robertson gave to the police. He took exception to what he read because he did not regard Mr Robertson’s account as true. He then co-operated fully with the police and gave a full record of interview. 
    10. I have heard evidence from Mr Bavadra who was called by Mr Willis who appeared for him. I have also seen evidence in the form of documents tendered by Ms Graham for the Crown, which became exhibits A and B, and a document tendered by Mr Willis, exhibit 1. I do not propose to review that evidence but I make the following findings.  
    11. First I make findings about how serious this offence was. The first thing to be said is that it was an armed robbery. In a sense Mr Bavadra was lucky not to be charged with something far more serious. Nevertheless it is important that I make it clear that I am sentencing him only for an armed robbery. Parliament nevertheless regards that as a serious offence and it attaches a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment to it. That is how serious an offence it is regarded. 
    12. The next factor is that the armed robbery was not committed alone by Mr Bavadra. It was committed in company. Being robbed by two men is a worse experience than being robbed by one. 
    13. The third thing I take into account, although I do it in a particular way, is the fact that the offence involved actual violence. I do not take that into account as an aggravating factor under s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I take it into account as demonstrating the way in which Mr Bavadra performed this particular robbery. A robbery can be taking somebody’s belongings accompanied by a threat or it can be taking somebody’s belongings accompanied by actual violence. An offence involving actual violence would be regarded as more serious than one involving no more than a threat. This is a case which involved actual violence. Mr Bavadra assaulted the victim three times during the course of robbing him. 
    14. The next thing I take into account is the probably obvious reaction of the young woman who was in the unit. Nevertheless it is a reaction which needs to be recorded. She said in her statement that she felt extremely scared. In fact she felt scared for her life. She thought that Mr Bavadra was going to pull the knife on her. She just wanted the male victim to hand everything to them so that they would leave. I do not regard that response as emotional harm which was substantial. In saying that I do not diminish it at all. A crime such as this may well have a long-term impact on a victim, but I do not have before me any evidence apart from the statement which I have referred to. But nor do I regard the response of the victim as a mitigating factor. I could do that if I thought her response amounted to emotional harm which was not substantial. In this regard I adopt Ms Graham’s submission and note the harm. In addition I take it into account, but its impact is neither mitigating for Mr Bavadra or aggravating for him. It is a consequence of his crime which needs to be noted and taken into account. 
    15. The next thing to be said about the offence is that it was not spontaneous or opportunistic, there was a degree of planning. The planning may have been relatively short-term but nevertheless it was arranged by phone and the detail of how the offence was going to be committed had been worked out in advance. Mr Bavadra had armed himself and there was some degree of planning. 
    16. The next thing to be said, although it does not aggravate the offence, is that Mr Bavadra does not have a good criminal record. A person without a criminal record at all may point to that and claim some leniency. A judge would be inclined to discount a sentence where the offender comes before the judge without any criminal record. But Mr Bavadra comes before me with a criminal record that involves offences such as stealing from the person, break, enter and steal, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and, significantly, a previous offence for armed robbery. For that offence he was sentenced by a judge of this court to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of eighteen months. That sentence was imposed on 1 August 2003. 
    17. They are all the circumstances which I take into account in assessing the seriousness of the crime committed by Mr Bavadra in this case.  
    18. I turn now to consider his own personal circumstances. To his credit he pleaded guilty. I say to his credit because I take that into account in his favour. The prosecutor acknowledges that his plea was made at the earliest opportunity. That makes sense because he was frank in his confession to the police. 
    19. I make the following findings based upon the evidence which was the pre-sentence report. Mr Bavadra’s childhood was stable and he was well supported by his family. He left school in Year 9 at the age of sixteen. He has been mainly unemployed since leaving school. He has in the past undertaken some TAFE courses on a full-time basis. He started using heroin when he was eighteen. He has done some programmes in custody related to his alcohol and other drug use but regarded them as “not in-depth enough”. 
    20. He was under the influence of drugs when he committed this particular offence. He expressed to the Probation and Parole Officer remorse for this crime. 
    21. There is another event which is significant for him and his family. His older brother Lorima was killed in a car accident about a year ago. That had, on Mr Bavadra’s evidence, a devastating impact on his family and on him. He was at liberty in the community at that stage. He had been sentenced for the previous armed robbery to three and a half years commencing 27 February 2003. That overall sentence concluded on 26 August 2006. Although a non-parole period of eighteen months was set concluding on 26 August 2004 Mr Bavadra breached his conditions of parole when he was released pursuant to that order. Hence he was returned to custody and released again on parole only a month or two before the expiry of the overall sentence on 26 August 2006. He therefore had a very limited time where he could turn to the Probation and Parole Service for support before his overall sentence expired. That lack of support combined with the tragic death of his brother, as he said in evidence, brought about a return to his old ways. His old ways included regular drug-taking, particularly what he described as party drugs. Affected by his brother’s death he returned to drug-taking and committed this particular offence whilst he was under the influence of drugs. That does not excuse the offence but it does explain it. 
    22. Mr Bavadra was born on 18 June 1984, so that he is now twenty-three years of age. I should add that after he was released in July 2006 and was for a very short period of time on parole, he had enrolled for the TAFE courses which I had referred to. He was attempting to complete Year 10 of his secondary schooling and was undertaking a Certificate Course in Health and Fitness. This was all interrupted by the return to his old ways associated with his brother’s death and led to the behaviour which amounted to the offence in this case. He said, and I accept, that he wants to do more courses which will assist him whilst he is in custody. He says that he is no longer taking drugs. He has concentrated on fitness and training whilst he has been in custody. He has been on remand up until now and it has been difficult to get into the programmes he would like to do. That will become easier when he is sentenced. He would like to do the Young Offenders Programme and a Violence Prevention Programme, although there may well be still some limitations because of two factors - which are probably themselves associated - one is that he has been convicted in the past of escaping police custody and the other is that he is being held in correctional centres which themselves have limited facilities. 
    23. The author of the pre-sentence report, Linda Burridge, said in her report dated 8 October 2007 that she regarded Mr Bavadra’s willingness to complete programmes relating to his offending behaviour as encouraging. She thought that he would benefit from the supervision and guidance of this service and recommended that any supervision concentrate on certain areas. 
    24. There is one other important piece of history I need to refer to. Mr Bavadra was convicted of the offence of bringing a syringe into a place of detention. That is an offence against the Summary Offences Act 1988. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment for that offence. It happened in these circumstances. He had been arrested, as I said, on 11 March 2001 in respect of the armed robbery that I am sentencing him for. He was processed by the police and handed over to Corrective Services. The processing by the police did not detect a syringe which was hidden on his person. Corrective Services discovered it on a strip search an that resulted in the charge and the sentence of six months imprisonment. That sentence commenced on 11 March 2007 and concluded on 10 September 2007. On one view of things a sentence which I impose should commence on 11 September 2007. I will return to that shortly. 
    25. Mr Willis in his submissions emphasised the full and frank admissions made to the police and realistically acknowledged the objective seriousness of the offence. He laid stress on the fact that his client had had a relatively short time on parole as a result of the previous armed robbery. This was despite him having a long-standing drug problem. 
    26. He also emphasised, in drawing my attention to the need to find special circumstances to adjust the non-parole period to the parole period, the risk that his twenty-three year old client may become institutionalised. He has spent a good deal of time in custody over the last five years.  
    27. He acknowledges his prospects for rehabilitation, once again realistically, as hopeful. He acknowledges the impact of the fact that his client has previous convictions and committed this offence in company and that there was a degree of planning, although he says unsophisticated. 
    28. I accept his submission that his client has been remorseful and I will take into account favourably to his client his plea of guilty and discount the sentence accordingly. 
    29. Mr Willis invites me to backdate the sentence to 11 March 2007. Ms Graham acknowledges that it is open to me to fully or partially backdate the sentence. I propose to backdate it fully. I do this for two reasons. The first reason is that the possession of the syringe was closely related to the offending behaviour that I am sentencing Mr Bavadra for. The second thing is the relevance of the risk to Mr Bavadra, a young man, that he could become institutionalised by spending so much time in gaol. As a concession to that factor I propose to backdate the sentence to 11 March 2007. 
    30. Mr Willis invites me to find special circumstances. Ms Graham acknowledges that it is open to me to make such a finding. I do find that there are special circumstances warranting the adjustment of the non-parole period and the parole period. In particular I note the recommendation of the pre-sentence report that a period of supervision at a high level would be appropriate and I accept the submission that this is a case where I need to take into account the risk that a young man could become institutionalised in prison. 
    31. Both legal representatives addressed the relevance of Henry. Mr Willis acknowledge that arguably the case was outside the guideline judgment of Henry because of his criminal record and a degree of actual violence. Nevertheless he said that Henry should remain as a guidepost. Ms Graham submitted that a sentence should be in excess of the Henry guideline but reminded me that the Henry guideline is based upon the assumption that the plea is quite late. In this case the plea was made at the earliest opportunity and Mr Bavadra needs to be given the benefit of such an early plea. 
    32. Turning to the factors which the Court of Criminal Appeal described in Henry as typical of an armed robbery case and relating them to Mr Bavadra’s case I make the following findings.  
     
      
      (1) He is a young offender but it cannot be said that he has little or no criminal history. He gets no leniency at all from his criminal history.  
      
      
      (2) He was armed with a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
       
      (3) There was more than a limited degree of planning in this case. I agree with Mr Willis that it was not sophisticated but it could not be described as limited. 
       
      (4) It cannot be said that there was limited, if any, actual violence. Although the violence was not extensive it was gratuitous and involved three separate assaults by Mr Bavadra on the male victim. 
       
      (5) The victim was in a vulnerable position. He was in his own home and therefore not able to call to members of the public for assistance. 
       
      (6) Relatively speaking it might be said a small amount was taken. On the other hand a thousand dollars would be regarded by some people as not a small amount. 
       
      (7) Mr Bavadra has pleaded guilty and, as I said, I take that into account.  
       
      For a typical case the Court of Criminal Appeal has proposed, or suggested a narrow sentencing range of between four and five years as the head sentence, or full term, for an armed robbery. 
      
    33. I regard Mr Bavadra’s case as being on balance more serious than the typical armed robbery case which the Court of Criminal Appeal had in mind. In particular there was a degree of planning and a degree of violence. This must be weighed against the fact that there was an early plea but also the typical case includes a person with little or no criminal history, so Mr Bavadra falls outside that range. 
    34. Nevertheless, because of his youth, which is a factor I take into account, I do not propose to impose a sentence which is far outside the Henry range. I propose to fix a head sentence of five and a half years to be served in this case.  
    35. For the reasons which I have given I find that there are special circumstances warranting my adjusting the proportion between the non-parole period and the parole period. In addition I propose to backdate the sentence for the reasons which I have already given. 
    36. Accordingly, I fix a non-parole period of two years and six months and a balance of the term of three years. 
    37. Stand up Mr Bavadra. Mr Bavadra for the offence of armed robbery I sentence you to an overall sentence of five years and six months. That is to commence on 11 March 2007 and to expire on 10 September 2012. I fix a non-parole period of two years and six months. It is to commence on 11 March 2007 and to expire on 10 September 2009. I fix the balance of the term after the non-parole period as three years to commence on 11 September 2009 and to expire on 10 September 2012. 
    38. When you are considered for parole by the Parole Authority I recommend to the Authority that they consider releasing you to the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service and that the Authority direct or recommend a case plan involving medium to high level of supervision with focus on the following four areas. 
     
      
      (1) Alcohol and other drug counselling or programme participation. 
       
      (2) Psychological counselling to assist you reintegrating into the community. 
       
      (3) Referral to an appropriate training and education programme. 
       
      (4) Referral to the Pacific Islander Programme facilitated by the Probation and Parole Service, Mount Druitt District Office. And for that reason I direct that the pre-sentence report accompany you into the Corrective Services System. 
      
     Just have a seat a moment Mr Bavadra. Now Ms Graham and Mr Willis are there any other formal orders that I need to make?WILLIS: I don’t think formal orders, I’m just not sure whether your Honour indicated that you had taken the Form 1 matter into account.HIS HONOUR: 39. I did towards the commencement of the sentence but, for abundant caution and as part of the orders in sentencing Mr Bavadra as I have, I indicate that I have taken into account the offence which is listed on the list of additional charges pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act s 32. 
    GRAHAM: Does your Honour’s order recommend release to parole with those certain conditions rather than order release to parole because it’s three years.HIS HONOUR: I didn’t - no I - yes I did - I didn’t order his release. I indicated that when he is considered for release by the Parole Authority that they recommend or direct those conditions.GRAHAM: And that’s because the parole--HIS HONOUR: It’s more than three years.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: On 15 August 2007 this Court delivered judgment in an appeal brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) against a sentence imposed upon the present applicant in the District Court following his conviction after jury trial on a charge of conspiracy to import into Australia cocaine in not less than the commercial quantity (Tyler v Regina; Regina v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247). The court allowed the Crown appeal, set aside the sentence imposed in the District Court and imposed a more severe sentence.  
     
      
    3 Pursuant to s 43(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) the applicant now applies to this Court to reopen the appeal. Section 43 is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        43 Court may reopen proceedings to correct sentencing errors 
         
        (1) This section applies to criminal proceedings (including proceedings on appeal) in which a court has:  
         
          
          (a) imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or 
           
          (b) …  
           
          and so applies whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence in those proceedings. 
          
         
        (2) The court may reopen the proceedings (either on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings) and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard:  
         
          
          (a) may impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and 
           
          (b) if necessary, may amend any relevant conviction or order. 
          
         
        (3) …  
         
        (4) …  
         
        (5) …  
         
        (6) …” 
        
       
      
    4 The applicant argues that the sentence imposed in this Court was “contrary to law”. Implicit in the application is that the Court adjust the sentence imposed by reducing it by 10 percent. 
     
      
    5 The basis of the argument is this. The applicant was originally sentenced by Berman DCJ on 4 May 2007. In his remarks on sentence Berman DCJ noted that (notwithstanding that he was convicted after trial) the applicant had assisted the authorities, that “not much came of” the assistance, and determined, therefore, that the sentence then to be imposed would be reduced by approximately 10 percent in recognition of that modest assistance. 
     
      
    6 The Crown appeal raised issues concerning the characterisation of the applicant’s role in the conspiracy, the adequacy of the sentence then imposed to reflect this criminality, and the adequacy of the sentence to reflect considerations of general deterrence. No ground of appeal complained either of the fact that a discount for assistance had been allowed, nor of its quantification.  
     
      
    7 In those circumstances, it is now put, the applicant was entitled to have the discount replicated in the sentence substituted by this Court. That entitlement arises (it is implicit in the applicant’s argument) because, where such a benefit is allowed at first instance and is not the subject of express complaint in a Crown appeal, it is the usual practice of this Court to adopt both the determination to make the allowance, and its quantification. That is, that, even having found that the Crown had made good some or all of its grounds of appeal, and having selected the sentence that ought, after appeal, be imposed, this Court would ordinarily, following its usual practice, discount the sentence by 10 percent. 
     
      
    8 The judgment of this Court does not indicate that that was done. Express recognition was given, in that part of the judgment that dealt with Berman DCJ’s remarks on sentence, to the discount. At [59] the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour then found that Chalmers had ‘assisted the authorities’, although he did not specify the nature or level of that assistance, merely observing ‘that not much came of’ it. Nevertheless, he discounted the sentence he otherwise would have imposed by approximately 10 percent.” 
        
       
      
    9 And a later reference was made to an argument put on behalf of the (then) respondent extrapolating the sentencing starting point, that is, what the sentence would have been had the 10 percent not been allowed. The Court was, therefore, well aware of the fact and the extent of the discount.  
     
      
    10 However, when the re-sentence was proposed, as is now pointed out, no express allowance was made. 
     
      
    11 In proposing the sentence to be substituted, I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A useful schedule is set out in a judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in  
        R v Lee  
        [2007] NSWCCA 234. It is a lengthy schedule, and I do not propose to repeat it here. On the basis of that information, and the objective and subjective circumstances, I propose that Chalmers be re-sentenced. I consider the appropriate range of head sentences is of 12 to 16 years. Having regard to the principles that apply to re-sentencing after a successful Crown appeal I propose that Chalmers be sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.” 
        
       
      
    12 The jurisdiction conferred on this Court by s 43 of the Sentencing Procedure Act to reopen an otherwise finalised appeal depends, relevantly, upon the applicant establishing that the sentence imposed was “contrary to law”. Precisely what that means has not (perhaps not surprisingly) been the subject of a great volume of judicial consideration. The predecessor to s 43 was s 24 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Although that section was framed differently, there is no difference in substance between the two provisions. Kirby P (as his Honour then was) with whom Gleeson CJ and Sheller JA agreed, proposed “the broadest available construction” in recognition of the beneficial nature of the provision: see Ho v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 37 NSWLR 393. Ho concerned a sentencing exercise in the District Court, in which, it was said, a judge failed (whether deliberately or by oversight was a live issue) to allow credit for presentence time served in custody; the s 43 question (which the Court was not called upon finally to answer) was whether failure to do so resulted in a sentence that was “contrary to law”. The Court was of the opinion that failure to consider that question did produce a penalty that was “contrary to law”. 
     
      
    13 Kirby P said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is a part of the law of sentencing that where a person has, in respect of an event of which that person is convicted and stands for sentence, already served some time in custody, the sentencing judge should take such period into account. Ordinarily, the judge should give credit to the offender for time already served. To fail to consider this is an error of law in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The resulting penalty is then one ‘contrary to law’; 
         
         
        (5) Differing views have been expressed by judges concerning the breadth of the phrase ‘contrary to law’ in s 24. Certainly, the section is not intended to permit a general rehearing of sentencing proceedings on the merits … However, whilst avoiding a rehearing of the merits of the penalty, it is common ground that the purpose of the section is to permit the correction of mistakes where ‘such correction would have saved the cost, delay and expense involved in having to institute an appeal’ … For the correction of arguable mistakes in sentencing, the section should be given the widest possible operation …” (internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    14 These remarks were delivered obiter, the Court having rejected the arguments advanced on behalf of that claimant in support of a summons for judicial review of the sentence imposed in the District Court. That does not diminish their value. The Court saw s 24 as an avenue for that claimant to pursue his complaint in the District Court. Accepting that, I can see no basis upon which it could be held that failure to allow a discount on sentence to which a respondent (or applicant) would ordinarily be entitled (if established) resulted other than in a sentence that is “contrary to law”. 
     
      
    15 The first question for this Court, therefore, is whether the sentence imposed upon the applicant was a sentence that was “contrary to law” because the Court failed to take into account, and replicate, (or, for proper reasons, declined to replicate) the discount allowed to the applicant by Berman DCJ. 
     
      
    16 The jurisdictional gateway to the reopening provided by s 24 is the establishment of relevant error of law, of the kind envisaged by Kirby P in Ho. That, in the present case, calls for examination of the judgment. While such error may be established by the failure to give consideration to, and make a determination about, the adoption of the discount, it is not so clear, to me at least, that error would be established had the Court adverted to the matter and determined it against the applicant.  
     
      
    17 The exercise involved has some unusual features. Ordinarily, an appellate Court asked to enquire into asserted error by a sentencing judge by oversight of some relevant factor has only available to it the official record of the Remarks on Sentence, from which it draws the necessary and appropriate inferences. Whether a relevant factor was or was not overlooked would be determined by a different judge – by an objective analysis of the written record. (On rare occasions, that may include the transcript of argument and debate.) Here, however, the Court is in the position of investigating, or enquiring into, its own thought processes. 
     
      
    18 I am firmly of the view that it is highly undesirable, and would be invidious, to undertake that exercise other than by analysis of the written record – in this case, the reasons for judgment. I do not propose to attempt to recall or explore my own thought processes; even less would I attempt to explore those of the other members of the Bench who concurred in my judgment. 
     
      
    19 It is true that the reasons for judgment express no explicit intention either to allow, or not to allow, the discount. Alone that would be suggestive of error of the kind referred to by Kirby P in Ho.  
     
      
    20 However, that is not the entirety of the issue. It is plain that the approach I proposed varied slightly from that taken by Berman DCJ. I attached considerable weight to the extensive review of comparable sentences collected by McClellan CJ at CL in Lee, and derived from that schedule a range of sentences I considered to be applicable to the applicant’s circumstances.  
     
      
    21 Re-examination of that schedule discloses, as might have been expected, that a number of the cases involved discounts in varying amounts for assistance. In other words, some discounts for assistance was built into the range of sentences upon the basis of which the ultimate sentence was selected. Two things are here of present significance: one is that the discount allowed by Berman DCJ was modest; the other is that, after determining the range of sentences applicable, I opted, in accordance with the principles applicable to Crown appeals, for the very lowest end of that range. 
     
      
    22 I have therefore concluded that, although it was never made as explicit as it might have been, that the applicant was not denied the benefit of the finding as to the assistance he had given.  
     
      
    23 The jurisdictional gateway to s 43 has therefore not been opened. I would refuse the application on this basis. 
     
      
    24 In any event, even if I were persuaded that the Court should reopen the appeal, I am satisfied that the sentence proposed and imposed was the very lowest possible having regard to the applicant’s criminality. Further to reduce the sentence would result in a sentence that is disproportionately low and would, while giving due weight to the subjective circumstances, fail to reflect the objective circumstances. 
     
      
    25 I propose that the application be dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1. Police were investigating the supply of cocaine focusing in particular on Granville and Merrylands. In the course of that work they uncovered a cell of four persons including Salim Tuameh knowingly involved in supplying cocaine. 2. With the use of phone taps, undercover police operatives, surveillance, marked money and other means police were able to obtain evidence against these four. Three of these offenders have already been sentenced by Judges of this Court. Today Salim Tuameh is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct between 8 March 2006 and 31 March 2006 when he knowingly took part in the supply of cocaine, a prohibited drug in New South Wales. 3. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court committed by this offender harming this community. 4. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, that is, his subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. 5. My fact-finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court a judge is not party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve him or her from the fact-finding responsibility. It simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it. 6. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will need to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, parity, the length of the parole period and of course the ultimate length of term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. 7. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts8.  One Aboud Yasin had made arrangements to supply 4 ounces or 112 grams of cocaine to an undercover operative involved in a controlled operation seeking to be supplied with drugs. Yasin of course was unaware he was dealing with a police operative. In the course of fulfilling that order Yasin received a portion of this cocaine, namely 22 grams, from Tuameh. 9. Lawfully intercepted telephone calls captured the negotiations, which led to that supply of 22 grams of cocaine for later use as evidence. Tuameh directed Yasin to “Fishing R Us”, a business run by his family located on Parramatta Road at Auburn, to collect the 22 grams of cocaine. Yasin was observed attending the shop, leaving shortly afterwards, placing an object in his pocket. As Yasin drove from the shop, telephone intercepts recorded further conversations with this offender where he discussed prices and the need to cut the cocaine with other agents in order to make a total volume of one ounce or 28 grams. 10. Yasin had made it clear to Tuameh that he was seeking 4 ounces for the purpose of supplying to the undercover operative. Yasin intended the 28 grams would then be mixed to a further 3 ounces or 84 grams of cocaine that he was obtaining elsewhere to satisfy a total supply quantity of 4 ounces or 112 grams of cocaine. 11. Yasin then spoke with Hamid, another member of the cell, and indicated that he required a further 3 ounces of cocaine. Ultimately Hamid and Yasin travelled separately to Granville Park in order to supply the total quantity of cocaine to the undercover operative. Yasin supplied the undercover operative with cocaine weighing a total of 109.6 grams. At that weight it fell short by 2.4 grams of the intended supply. He received $26,000 in cash payment. Tuameh was not present at the time of this exchange. The cocaine was seized by police, the money however was never recovered. 12. Prior to 30 March another arrangement was made between Yasin and the undercover operative for the supply of a further 4 ounces or 112 grams of cocaine. On 24 March 2006 Tuameh contacted Yasin indicating to Yasin that he had access to further quantities of cocaine. On 28 March Tuameh rang Yasin indicating that he would be “good for further” cocaine for Yasin to supply to the undercover operative and for providing a better price than Yasin might otherwise obtain. Tuameh described in this conversation a maroon Hyundai Excel motor vehicle he had bought. That call was finalised with Yasin confirming that he would see Tuameh at his shop Fishing R Us the following day. 13. About 4pm on 29 March 2006 Tuameh contacted Yasin stating that there was “one person that wanted ‘five five’ but he could get it from the Asians for ‘five four’”. By “five five” or “five four” Tuameh was quoting prices of cocaine available as being $5,500 or $5,400 per ounce. There were further calls between Tuameh and Yasin on 29 and 30 March 2006 on the same topic. On 30 March 2006 Tuameh and Yasin met, travelled to a location where Tuameh then lent Yasin his Hyundai Excel. Further calls were intercepted whereby Tuameh directed Yasin to a location to receive the cocaine. Tuameh and Yasin were also under physical surveillance during this time. 14. The agreed facts then say Yasin went alone to Granville Park area where he met with the undercover operative and supplied the cocaine. They commenced the drug and money exchange. It would seem that in the course of that exercise police arrested Yasin and seized 108.1 grams of cocaine. About 2.40pm that day police executed a search warrant on Fishing R Us where Tuameh was arrested. So far as the evidence goes it does not disclose finding any incriminating material at that site. 15. Tuameh was taken to Parramatta Police Station. He declined to be interviewed and was charged. Objective Criminality16. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of an offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender in the commission of that offence. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the case before the court with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality will usually have the most important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 17. The courts and the legislature have made it clear that drug supplying is an unacceptable criminal activity. It should not be difficult to understand why. The courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of a drug offence it is necessary to have regard to the drug’s potential for harm. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by its direct impact upon those who purchase drugs and by its indirect impact upon the community at large. For some users, drugs such as the one that I am concerned with here, cocaine, can be addictive. 18. Some illicit drugs are destructive causing or contributing to mental health problems and/or aggression. Supplying drugs can lead to, create or sustain drug addicts. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and to feel human is smothered to a greater or a lesser extent by their addiction and the other effects of drugs. Some drugs are otherwise harmful to the health both physical and mental of persons. This is the real essence of the criminal harm done by those supplying drugs to others, that is, that in a greater or a lesser way they are contributing to the disenabling of other human beings who consume drugs. 19. Associated with addiction are other forms of crime such as armed robbery, break and steal and crimes of fraud, that is, a loss to an owner of property from his or her productive efforts at the hands of the drug addict. Associated with those crimes is the trauma, emotional and psychological, that occurs to victims. Spending money on drugs by addicts without corresponding productivity to the community amounts to a monumental transference of wealth usually from those who are already poor or struggling without any corresponding economic gain for the community. At every level then drug supplying is criminal conduct because of its corrosive effect upon individuals and society as a whole. 20. This offender has not been charged with supply, but in the course of his dealings with Yasin he became concerned in two deliveries of drugs to the undercover police operative. The total quantity of cocaine supplied in those two deliveries amounts to 217.7 grams of cocaine. The significance of that sum is to be measured against these benchmarks. A trafficable quantity of cocaine, that is, a quantity of cocaine that is considered sufficiently large for the authorities to regard as being held by a person for the purposes of supply, is measured at 3 grams. An indictable quantity of cocaine is measured at 5 grams. Indictable means that it would come before this Court rather than the Local Court. It is another measure of seriousness. The commercial quantity is measured at 250 grams and the large commercial quantity at 1 kilogram. 21. The maximum penalty for an indictable quantity is fifteen years imprisonment, for a commercial quantity twenty years imprisonment, and for a large commercial quantity if memory serves me life imprisonment. The supply that Tuameh was involved in is about 33 grams shy of a commercial quantity. His involvement in the first delivery involved the supply of 22 grams, advising on prices, drawing attention of the need to dilute the cocaine he had supplied with other agents to increase its volume to 28 grams. 22. As to the second delivery Tuameh’s involvement was to inform Yasin of his access to cocaine, then to present as being able to obtain cocaine at a better price, to advise Yasin of prices per ounce being offered by sellers, joining with Yasin to travel to a location where he lent his Hyundai Excel so that Yasin could collect and pay for the cocaine. Implicit in that must be that Tuameh arranged to put Yasin in contact with the suppliers of the cocaine. I am also satisfied the Hyundai was used by Yasin to return from the supplier. What is unclear on the evidence however is whether Yasin returned to this offender or went directly to the rendezvous with the undercover operatives in the Excel and with the cocaine. In other words it is not made clear whether there was any change of vehicles, it not being proved I am not permitted to speculate. 23. In respect of both deliveries Tuameh’s involvement was critical to Yasin’s success in delivering the specified quantity of cocaine and in the second in the actual delivery of the specified drug and quantity. His role in the second delivery was as a facilitator between Yasin and the ultimate supplier of the cocaine. His role in the first was by way of advisor and completing the total quantity of drug required. I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt his involvement in both deliveries was for financial gain. I am satisfied he supplied the 22 grams of cocaine in the first delivery at some profit to himself. I am also satisfied there was some financial benefit accruing to him for his involvement in the role of facilitator. 24. Finally, it is important to note this offender’s capacity to operate at the level he did can only be consistent with past activity. In other words, his involvement in these two deliveries was not a one off first time event for him. Put another way, this offending conduct cannot be viewed as some unpredictable, inexplicable act contrary to his past experiences. His level of criminal culpability in the two deliveries represented by the charge of knowingly concerned in supply is significant. As I said, it was critical to the success of each delivery. Subjective Matters 25. I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but also I am sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. Background, Personal Circumstances, Relationship26. Tuameh is a twenty-nine year old man residing with his wife in Guildford. He is the third eldest of five siblings. He was born in Australia although is parents are of Lebanese origin. They all returned to Lebanon in 1999. He returned to Australia and worked in the family fishing tackle store. In 2002 though he returned to Lebanon, married in June of that year and returned with his bride to Australia. 27. It appears his family is supportive. He and his wife have had conflicts relating to his self indulgent, negative, peer oriented and drug indulgent lifestyle. In more recent times there apparently has been some improvement. His wife was in Court supporting him when submissions were being put yesterday. Education, Skills and Employment28. The offender completed Year 10 at the Merrylands High School. He claimed his parents strove to give him the best in terms of education. He commenced working at seventeen. What happened between leaving Year 10 and seventeen is unclear. He began a bricklaying apprenticeship in 1998. That was interrupted when his family moved to Lebanon the following year. Upon his return he worked in the family fish tackle shop. Matthew Carlton, a rehabilitation consultant with CRS Australia, notes “Mr Tuameh is also restricted from undertaking retail store management that he has been employed in, in the past as he is unable to be alone in the store in case he experiences another [epileptic] seizure.” 29. On the other hand Joseph Chalouh wrote a reference to the offender in which he noted the offender has “helped in the management and running of his business and has moved mountains of stock in a single day without complaining about the workload”. On 9 March 2006 the accused directed his co-offender to meet at the Fishing R Us store to collect 22 grams of cocaine. On 31 March Tuameh was also working at the shop when police arrived with the search warrant. He told Probation and Parole he had been employed in the family business for four years. I am satisfied he was working in the fish tackle shop during the early part of 2006. It may be he is seeking to use epilepsy as a means of claiming invalid status or for some other purpose, but I do not accept that he has told Mr Carlton the complete truth. In any event he also appears to possess work skills as a bricklayer and in retail selling. General Health 30. His doctor, without providing any history, claims Tuameh has been suffering epilepsy since 2002. The doctor says he is receiving medication for it. His last attack was on 23 March 2005 when he suffered a single, generalised seizure lasting several minutes. Significantly, that seizure is said to have occurred eight months after he stopped taking his medicine to control his epilepsy. What is interesting to note however is that ten days before that seizure and before telling the Auburn Hospital he had not taken his medication for eight months he was telling Peter Kalogiannis he had been taking Epilim (an epilepsy suppressor) daily. 31. There is a report from his dentist dated 18 October 2007 claiming the offender has been attending the dental clinic of Dr Adel Mathias “for urgent dental treatment course which in my view might take a month to complete”. What the nature of this condition was requiring urgent dental treatment was not disclosed. No history was given. The month predicted for the treatment has now completed, one can only assume the problem requiring the treatment has now been resolved. 32. Mr Tuameh presented in Court on crutches. I assume that related to a comminuted fracture of the proximal to the mid shaft of the tibia. That injury occurred in February 2007. In May 2007 Dr Hanna, the offender’s GP, notes that the initial treatment was open reduction and fixation. Dr Hanna remarks that unfortunately the wound became infected and noted that he was using antibiotics and dressing daily. 33. Mr Tuameh has also been consulting his physiotherapist since April 2007 in respect of this injury. On 3 December the physiotherapist notes, “We are in the process of having Tuameh comfortably ambulating without the aid of crutches”. Even so, the physiotherapist believes it is imperative for him to continue with physiotherapy for a further six months to improve what has been achieved.  
     
      
        
       
      The most recent Probation and Parole report notes,  
       
       
      “Mr Tuameh failed to attend three prearranged appointments on 29, 30 and 31 October. He cited work and a conflicting specialist appointment as reasons for failure to attend the first two appointments...in interview the offender related dental problems and ongoing physiotherapy for a motor cycle accident as factors of concern for him at present...Mr Tuameh subsequently notified the Service he had been hospitalised with gastrointestinal virus from 1 December 2007...Mr Tuameh has related a number of unverified health problems...”  
      
     34. A number of matters are worth noting. In that report the offender cited work as among other reasons for his failure to attend. However, in May 2007 he told Probation and Parole he was “unemployed” and a “financial drain on his family”. CRS Australia has commented in July 2007 that “a vocational rehabilitation program to assist him return to employment” was being undertaken. The offender’s work status consequently is unclear. 35. I note that Tuameh does not nominate to Probation and Parole the specialist he is seeing. The letter from the dentist in October 2006 does not specify any dates of appointments. Tuameh claims, I’m going to physiotherapy for a “motor cycle” accident to Probation and Parole. Yet the physiotherapist appears to be treating a fracture that the offender told Peter Kalogiannis he had received whilst jogging in the evening with his friend. 36. The onus of proving mitigating factors falls upon the defence. While there is evidence before the Court of various conditions, as the evidence presently stands it also raises issues requiring clarification. At the end of the day I can put my findings this way.  
     
      
      ·  
        
      I am satisfied he has had some epileptic seizures. Those are likely to be contained by medication, but he appears not to be taking it at least regularly.  
      ·  I am satisfied he had some need for some form of dental treatment, has had the opportunity to have that treatment, but whether he has availed of that opportunity is unknown, but he seems to have used it as a basis for failing to comply with Probation and Parole appointments without prior consultation with them.  
      ·  In February 2007 he fractured his right tibia. It was set by standard medical procedures. At some point there was an infection. The cause of the facture is unclear as are the circumstances in which it occurred. He has received some physiotherapy for it although how frequently and what progress was made as a consequence of physiotherapy is unclear. Long after the fracture should have healed he presents in court on crutches, but with no medical record of its progress. I do note however his hypochondrial scores in psychological testing were high. There is no evidence before the court other than second hand hearsay that he was hospitalised with a gastrointestinal virus from 1 December 2007.  
      
    In those circumstances the case for mitigating any sentence outcome on the basis of general physical health is weak. Mental Health Issues 37. The defence retained Mr Peter Kalogiannis, consultant psychologist, who prepared two reports on Tuameh. Mr Kalogiannis assessed the offender as presenting with symptoms that placed him in the moderate range of depression, the severe range of experiencing anxiety and having features consistent with bipolar issues in his personality. 38. In both reports he expresses the opinion that Tuameh is immature and impulsive, although his testing only focused on symptoms exhibited in the fortnight preceding each test. He sought to extrapolate from testing an opinion “It...seems likely that his mental state at the time of the offence was one of disorganised paranoia and chaotic thoughts also adversely contributed to by his excessive use of substances....” 39. It is difficult understanding this assessment from the material before me. Scores from the March test that appear to contradict this diagnosis include: ·  Impulsivity - slightly below average, prudent, sober, serious·  Conformity - average score for males ·  Suspiciousness - slightly above average, hard to fool, jealous·  Imagination - average score for males ·  Shrewdness - very high score, shrewd, polished, calculating·  Self sufficiency - average for normal male·  Self-discipline - average for normal male.40. It follows that I regard Mr Kalogiannis as overstating the offender’s mental condition prior to the offending conduct and at the time of the offending conduct. He also has failed to distinguish between the stressors prior to and at the time of offending from the stressors arising as a consequence of being caught, charged and seeing co-offenders sentenced to substantial periods of imprisonment. Drug and Alcohol 41. Tuameh told Probation and Parole he began using drugs at the age of twenty-two. He told Peter Kalogiannis “he didn’t actually like drugs” and that his consumption of them was a consequence of peer pressure and helped dealing with stress. 42. He links his early drug abuse to helping him deal with anger after arguments with his wife. He concedes use of large amounts of cocaine and ecstasy and occasionally cannabis. His cocaine use was daily. When using drugs, presumably ecstasy and cocaine, he would skip sleep often for days. Then he would become irritable and cranky. 43. There were other times he said when he could go without drugs and work full time. In May he told Probation and Parole he had ceased all illicit drug use. I am satisfied his involvement in drugs made his participation in this offence easier for him than it would have been without that drug history. I accept that some portion of his financial reward was spent on drugs, but in the light of his concession of occasions of minimal drug use when working full time I do not regard his level of dependency as reaching a level where it was a factor in his determination to be involved in this offending conduct. 44. I note to his credit that Tuameh does not appear to have problems with alcohol. Criminal History and Character45.  Tuameh is a married man aged thirty. He appears to have good family support and a stable childhood environment. After leaving school he presented as having a good work ethic. He still works in the family fishing tackle business. Regrettably, his associates are linked to drug dealing and probable drug use. 46. To date his criminal offending has been dealt with completely in the Local Court. All of his offences to date are related to driving and traffic matters. Such, however, has been his persistence in driving whilst disqualified that he has received imprisonment, for example, sixteen months, six months and four months. All of those terms of imprisonment were suspended in December of last year. 47. It was within three months that he was thereafter involved in this offence. While those offences on his criminal record are different in kind to drug offences, what they do demonstrate is a calculated disregard for orders made by the Court. The commission of this offence at a time when he was on s 12 bonds to be of good behaviour aggravates the seriousness of this offending conduct. No doubt he will also be called up in respect of each breach of each bond, but that is not a matter I need to consider. 48. I have already noted his past criminal history discloses no prior drug offences. He is entitled to some mitigation on that account. Attitude to Offence 49. This offender has not given evidence. Thus it is very difficult to form any personal view as to his level of remorse. Probation and Parole when speaking to this offender about the offence noted in May 2005, “The offender did not dispute the police facts, he mentions that he accepts his behaviour and attitude was not acceptable and appears to be remorseful and disappointed in his actions. He claimed that the reason behind his ongoing illicit drug use was to suppress his feelings of anger and stress within his relationship and his financial difficulties.” 50. Mr Tuameh presents as a person who has a stable upbringing and close connection with his family, which appear to be a positive influences in his life. He now acknowledges that if he is going to modify his offending behaviour he will have to attend appropriate criminogenic interventions. In speaking to Peter Kalogiannis he “expressed remorse and appeared to understand that he was in need of extensive psychological intervention and retraining in areas such as anger management, communications skills...” 51. His plea of guilty demonstrates acknowledgment of his offending conduct and a willingness to be held accountable for it. Nonetheless that acknowledgment and willingness occurs in the face of a strong crown case. My own sense of his interaction with Mark Matenga of Probation and Parole and Peter Kalogiannis is that Mr Tuameh regrets having been caught, feels embarrassment at the hurt and embarrassment he has caused his family and wife. I do note in the tests administered by Mr Kalogiannis his sense of guilt was at a high level, but regrettably it is unclear what that guilt is directed towards. 52. As yet he appears unmotivated to focus on drug rehabilitation and clearly his current response to intervention as referred to in the Probation and Parole report of 10 December last appears disappointing. Plea Status53. This offender has pleaded guilty before the Local Court. That plea was early entered. The plea has utilitarian value. It must be recognised as a significant contribution by this offender to advancing the administration of criminal justice in this case firstly and foremost because those interests are served through public acknowledgement by an offender of guilt. Pleas of guilt by offenders sustain the community’s confidence in the administration of criminal justice in that they maintain confidence of the community in the investigation of crime and the community’s expectation that persons guilty of crime will be held accountable for them. 54. Criminal justice is also served because court time, witness’s time, legal expenses and the like are freed so they can be devoted to other cases. This plea will reduce considerably the likelihood of a contest at the Court of Criminal Appeal on an issue of guilt in respect of this charge. All of these are important utilitarian factors so far as the administration of justice is concerned. In the light of that value I intend to give a discount of twenty-five per cent for the plea. Rehabilitation Prospects55. There are a number of positive rehabilitation prospects including: ·  family support and support from wife ·  accommodation available on release ·  presumably work available in the family business ·  possession of other work skills including bricklaying·  he possesses an insight into the dangers of being involved in the drug culture, although has not yet done much about it other than to claim to be drug free ·  level of regret recognising impact of offending on family, wife and himself ·  an absence of anti-social mental health issues.On the negative side are the following: ·  failure to cooperate with Probation and Parole in recent months·  failure to be of good behaviour even though that failure would result in imprisonment, that is, a willingness to take risks endangering his future welfare regardless of consequence ·  past disobedience to orders of the Court, another manifestation of his risk taking behaviour ·  past entrenched history of drug abuse ·  Peter Kalogiannis’s opinion of the need for psychological counselling which has not yet been pursued to completion ·  a proneness to poor general health. 56. The best that can be said of this offender is that his rehabilitation prospects are clouded. Whenever he continues his association with the drug culture and continues to engage in risk taking behaviour, his rehabilitation prospects will be in peril. Setting the SentenceDeterrence 57. In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by both federal and state parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law as put in place by parliament is to deter those in the community tempted to breach the criminal law. Parliament applies deterrence by prescribing maximum penalties for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law he or she is exposed to that maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. In this case the maximum penalty is one of fifteen years. 58. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires a sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind that maximum penalty available and its deterrent purpose. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals like minded to the offender who but for such deterrence would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced. 59. Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to the offender with a view to discouraging or deterring him or her from re-offending. 60. Bearing that in mind, the overall sentence that I would have imposed for this offence is one of four years imprisonment. Applying the twenty-five per cent discount to that figure it becomes one of three years imprisonment. 61. I have determined to find special circumstances, the basis upon which I do so is twofold. This is this offender’s first time in custody and secondly, a custodial environment is an artificial environment in which to advance rehabilitation particularly in respect of drug issues. Drug rehabilitation and the certainty of rehabilitation can be better assessed if it is advanced in the community or at a full time drug rehabilitation setting. 62. The distribution then of the sentence that I would have imposed was one of eighteen months non-parole and eighteen months balance of term. Mr Vertigan who appears for the offender has submitted there may be an issue of parity of sentencing arising. Parity is a principle relating to the question of whether an offender may have a justifiable sense of grievance because an offender having like circumstances received more favourable treatment from a court. It does not form a basis for increasing a sentencing outcome, but rather may provide a basis for exercising discretion to reduce a sentencing outcome. 63. Both parties agree the co-offender whose criminality is most likely to parallel this offender’s is Yusef Assam. Yusef Assam was sentenced by Judge Quirk on 12 June 2007. Points to be made in respect of his sentence include: ·  Six days of prior custody·  Twenty-five per cent discount for early plea.Sentence for supply comprised of: ·  Agreement to supply 112 grams on 17 January, that agreement not fulfilled ·  Supplying to Yasim with co-offender Hamid 3 ounces of cocaine to fulfil the order which was ultimately 109.6 grams delivered ·  Agreement to supply cocaine for the delivery on 30 March, that agreement being unfulfilled. Form 1 matters:  ·  Deem supply 5.1 grams of cocaine ·  Possess 23.1 grams of cannabis ·  Possess prohibited weapon Curber brand crossbow and 83 rounds of ammunition ·  Possess methylamphetamine 2 grams Subjective matters:  - Aged twenty at time of offending, good family supportive - Minor criminal history including drive whilst disqualified for which he received a community service order of 200 hours  - Breach of s 9 good behaviour bond  
     
      
      ·  
        
      Working as a labourer for electrical contractor, good report from employer  
      ·  Responded well to past Probation and Parole supervision 
      ·  Doing TAFE literary course 
      ·  Psychologically assessed as “developmentally delayed” and having a “substance abuse disorder”  
      ·  Positive rehabilitation progress since offending, regular drug screening.  
      
    The objective criminality in Assam’s case seems to me to exceed that of the offender. Firstly, he has made an agreement to supply 112 grams of cocaine. That would constitute at law a sufficient material to charge him with supplying that. Secondly, where this offender has supplied 22 grams of cocaine, Assam has been involved in the supply of approximately 84 grams of cocaine. Thirdly, he agreed to supply all of the cocaine, which Yasim was looking for, for the 30 March deal. On the other hand as against that this offender facilitated Yasim actually getting the cocaine. 64. Finally, the matters on the Form 1 required her Honour to increase her assessment of the objective criminality. On the other hand Assam’s subjective features are substantially more powerful than this offender’s. To reflect that greater objective criminality of Assam but tempering any adjustment in the light of this offender’s less favourable substantive circumstances I have decided to reduce the sentence I otherwise would have given by two months diminishing both the non-parole period I otherwise would have given by one month and the balance of term by one month. Time in custody previously in respect of this offence has amounted to nine days. This sentence therefore will need to be backdated to 4 December. Would you stand up please, Mr Tuameh. 65. Salim Tuameh, I convict you of the offence that you between 8 March and 31 March 2006 at Merrylands in the State of New South Wales did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug namely cocaine. For that offence I sentence you to a non-parole period of seventeen months to commence on 4 December 2007 and to expire on 3 May 2009. I set a balance of term of seventeen months to expire on 3 October 2010. I order your release to parole on 3 May 2009.  HIS HONOUR: I recommend to the Department of Corrective Services that this offender’s health needs to be assessed as a matter of priority.

     SUMMARY 
      
      
     
     
      
      The appellant was charged with collecting certain documents which were connected with preparation for a terrorist act, knowing that connection, with doing a certain act in preparation for a terrorist act and with possessing a certain thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act, knowing that connection. The documents in the first charge were maps of the Australian electricity supply grid. The act in the second was seeking information from a chemical supply company about the availability of materials capable of being used to make explosives or incendiary devices. The thing in the third charge was a document setting out the ingredients for and the method of making poisons, explosives, detonators, incendiary devices, etcetera. The charges were laid under ss101.5, 101.6 and 101.4 respectively of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The maximum prescribed sentences were imprisonment for ten years, for life and for ten years respectively. The jury found the appellant guilty of the three offences but not guilty of a fourth. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment to concurrent terms totalling twenty years. A non-parole period of fifteen years was set.  
       
       
      Early in the trial the appellant appealed by leave to this Court under s5F Criminal Appeal Act against the refusal of the trial judge to quash the indictment for duplicity and want of particularity: see [2006] NSWCCA 121. The first ground of appeal raised again matters dealt with in that judgment and the Court declined to deal with them.  
       
       
      The second ground of appeal asserted that s31(8) National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (Commonwealth) (the NSI Act) was invalid because it breached Ch III Australian Constitution by usurping the judicial power of the Commonwealth which was vested solely in the judiciary. The NSI Act is concerned with protecting national security by empowering judges to make non-disclosure orders. The legislation applies if the prosecutor gives the Attorney General written notice that the Act applies. Then the prosecutor and the defence are required to notify the Attorney General of certain matters relating to the disclosure in the proceedings of information that relates to national security or the disclosure of which may affect national security. Criminal proceedings for these purposes include production, inspection and disclosure of documents. If the Attorney General considers that the disclosure of information is likely to prejudice national security the Attorney General may issue a certificate describing the information and prohibiting disclosure expect in permitted circumstances. If the Attorney General so certifies, the Court must hold a hearing to decide whether to make an order about disclosure of the information. By s31 the Court may order that a person may in permitted circumstances or must not disclose information or may or must not call a particular witness. By subs (7) the Court in deciding whether to make an order must consider whether, having regard to the Attorney General’s certificate, there would be a risk of prejudice to national security if the information were disclosed or the witness called and whether the order would have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant’s right to a fair trial, as well as any other relevant matter. By subs (8) the Court is to give “greatest” weight to the assessed risk of prejudice to national security.  
       
       
      The Attorney General issued a certificate and the other steps followed. The trial judge held a hearing and made orders concerning documents produced to the Court.  
       
       
      It was submitted on appeal that by requiring the Court to give “greatest” weight to the risk of prejudice to national security the Parliament had usurped the judicial function by directing the judge hearing the case how the case must effectively be decided. The Court decided that the use of the word ‘”greatest” as possibly applicable to the weighing of more than two circumstances meant no more than that greater weight must be given to the risk of prejudice to national security than to any other of the circumstances weighed. If only two circumstances were weighed, it would be construed to mean “greater”. The effect of the subsection was not to usurp judicial power by requiring that the balance must always come down in favour of the risk of prejudice to national security. Subs (8) was not constitutionally invalid.  
       
       
      The third and fourth grounds of appeal asserted that evidence of an association between the appellant and a man called Willie Brigitte should have been excluded because it had no probative value. It was no more than evidence of association. It was held that the association and communications between the appellant and Brigitte amounted to a circumstance capable of explaining why the appellant acted as he did. The Court rejected an alternative submission that the risk of unfair prejudice outweighed the probative value of the evidence. It was submitted that evidence of identification by photograph of Brigitte ought to have been rejected because the manner of identification was prone to produce error. The submission was rejected.  
       
       
      The fifth ground of appeal relied on evidence given after the trial by the witness who had identified Brigitte by photograph. An answer he gave was said to be capable of throwing doubt on the integrity of the process of identification. The Court considered that the evidence lacked the necessary cogency and decided not to receive it.  
       
       
      The sixth ground of appeal asserted that the trial judge had erred in refusing to direct verdicts of acquittal because the Crown could not prove that when he did the act forming the basis of each of the charges the appellant had determined when, how, where or by whom the relevant terrorist act might be carried out. The Court observed that the acts charged were preparatory only and that proof of the matters raised was not necessary for conviction.  
       
       
      The Court dismissed the appeal against conviction. 
       
       
      In granting leave to appeal against sentence and dismissing the appeal the Court held that the trial judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences was not flawed, that his Honour had not failed to give sufficient weight to the conditions in which the appellant would be held in custody, that his Honour did not err in not reducing the head sentence by reference to s19AG Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth) and that the sentence was not manifestly excessive. The Court emphasised the need, in sentencing for culpable acts preparatory to acts of terrorism, for courts to impose sentences which protect the community.  
        
       
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I have read the judgment of Barr J in draft. His Honour deals with the facts and with the submissions relating to the grounds of appeal other than Ground 2. I agree with his Honour’s reasons for rejecting each ground of appeal with which his Honour deals. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    The second ground of appeal is that:  
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erred in applying an unconstitutional test in determining whether information, the disclosure of which was sought by the Appellant, was subject to public interest immunity.” 
        
       
      
    2 This ground of appeal raises the constitutional validity of provisions of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (Cth) (here after the “NSI Act”) which empower the court to order a person not to disclose national security information as defined in the Act. 
     
      
    3 This issue arose as a result of a subpoena to produce documents issued on behalf of the appellant. A number of documents were the subject of a ruling by Whealy J that neither party should disclose documents or should do so only in redacted form. His Honour decided the matter in accordance with the NSI Act.  
     
      
    4 The non-disclosure orders affected most of the documents under consideration. His Honour did, however, in a considered judgment, order that certain material be disclosed to the appellant. 
     
      
    5 Save on the basis of constitutional invalidity, there is no appeal from his Honour’s non-disclosure orders. Furthermore, the aspect of the NSI Act which arises on this ground of appeal concerns the manner in which the Act regulates access to documents sought on subpoena. This ground focuses attention on s 31(8) of the NSI Act.   
     
      
       
      The Legislative Scheme 
       
      
    6 The application of the Act is triggered by a notice in writing by the prosecutor to the accused, and to the Court, that the Act applies to the proceedings. (s 6(1)) 
     
      
    7 The words “national security” are defined in s 8 to s 11 in terms which do not arise on the submissions in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    8 Section 24(1)(a)-(c) requires a prosecutor or the defendant to notify the Attorney General of certain matters, which do not need to be set out in full. It is sufficient to note, for present purposes, that these provisions refer to the disclosure in a federal criminal proceeding of information “that relates to national security” or “may affect national security”.  
     
      
    9 It is pertinent, for present purposes, to note that the “production, inspection or disclosure of … documents” is identified as “part of a criminal proceeding”. (s 13(2)(c)) 
     
      
    10 The first directly relevant step for present purposes was the issue of a certificate by the Attorney General pursuant to s 26(2)(b). The relevant provisions of s 26 are: 
     
      
       
        
        “26(1) This section applies if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any of the following happens: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the Attorney-General is notified under section 24 that the prosecutor or defendant knows or believes that the prosecutor or defendant or another person will disclose information in a federal criminal proceeding; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the Attorney-General for any reason expects that any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs 24(1)(a) to (c) will arise under which the prosecutor or defendant or another person will disclose information in a federal criminal proceeding; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the Attorney-General considers that the disclosure is likely to prejudice national security. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If the information would be disclosed in a document (the  
        source document 
        ), the Attorney-General may give each potential discloser (see subsection (8)) of the information in the proceeding: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any of the following: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) a copy of the document with the information deleted; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) a copy of the document with the information deleted and a summary of the information attached to the document; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) a copy of the document with the information deleted and a statement of facts that the information would, or would be likely to, prove attached to the document; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          together with a certificate that describes the information and states that the potential discloser must not, except in permitted circumstances, disclose the information (whether in the proceeding or otherwise), but may disclose the copy, or the copy and the statement or summary; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a certificate that describes the information and states that the potential discloser must not, except in permitted circumstances, disclose the information (whether in the proceeding or otherwise). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
      (Section 26(8) identifies, relevantly, the prosecutor and defendant as a “potential discloser”.) 
       
      
    11 In the present case the Attorney General issued certificates prohibiting disclosure of information in the documents to which the appellant sought access. 
     
      
    12 The present proceedings are federal criminal proceedings as defined in s 14(a) of the Act, being proceedings for an offence against the law of the Commonwealth. In such a case s 27 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “27(1) If a proceeding is covered by paragraph 14(a) (about a proceeding involving a trial) and, under section 26, the Attorney-General gives a potential discloser a certificate at any time during a part of the proceeding that takes place before the trial begins, the certificate is conclusive evidence, during that part of the proceeding and any later part that takes place before the hearing mentioned in paragraph (3)(a) begins, that disclosure of the information in the proceeding is likely to prejudice national security. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (3) If a proceeding is covered by paragraph 14(a) (about a proceeding involving a trial) and, under section 26, the Attorney-General gives a potential discloser a certificate at any time during the proceeding, the court must: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in any case where the certificate is given to the court before the trial begins – before the trial begins, hold a hearing to decide whether to make an order under section 31 in relation to the disclosure of the information; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if subparagraph 26(1)(a)(i) or (iii) applies and the certificate is given to the court after the trial begins – continue the adjournment of the proceeding mentioned in subsection 24(4) or 25(7) for the purpose of holding a hearing to decide whether to make an order under section 31 in relation to the disclosure of the information; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) if subparagraph 26(1)(a)(ii) applies and the certificate is given to the court after the trial begins – adjourn the proceeding for the purpose of holding a hearing to decide whether to make an order under section 31 in relation to the disclosure of the information. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) If the Attorney-General revokes the certificate at any time while the proceeding is adjourned or the hearing is being held, the court must end the adjournment or the hearing. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The closed hearing requirements apply to the hearing.” 
        
       
      
    13 Detailed provision is made for the conduct of a closed hearing by s 29, which does not need to be fully set out. 
     
      
    14 Section 31 empowers the Court to make orders. Subsequent sections make provisions for steps to be taken after the making of orders, which were not relied upon in this appeal. The critical provision is s 31(8), which must be understood in the context of s 31: 
     
      
       
        
        “31(1) After holding a hearing required under subsection 27(3) in relation to the disclosure of information in a federal criminal proceeding, the court must make an order under one of subsections (2), (4) and (5) of this section. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) If the information is in the form of a document, the court may order under this subsection that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any person to whom the certificate mentioned in subsection 26(2) or (3) was given in accordance with that subsection; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any person to whom the contents of the certificate have been disclosed for the purposes of the hearing; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) any other specified person; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        must not, except in permitted circumstances, disclose the information (whether in the proceeding or otherwise), but may, subject to subsection (3), disclose (which disclosure may or may not be the same as was permitted in the Attorney-General’s certificate) in the proceeding: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) a copy of the document with the information deleted; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) a copy of the document with the information deleted and a summary of the information, as set out in the order, attached to the document; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) a copy of the document with the information deleted and a statement of facts, as set out in the order, that the information would, or would be likely to, prove attached to the document. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) If the court makes an order under subsection (2), the copy of the document is admissible in evidence if, apart from the order, it is admissible. However if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a person who is the subject of the order seeks to adduce evidence of the contents of the document; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the contents of the document are admissible in evidence in the proceeding; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the person may adduce evidence of the contents of the document by tendering the copy, or the copy and the summary or statement, mentioned in that subsection. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The court may, regardless of the form of the information, order under this subsection that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) any person to whom the certificate mentioned in subsection 26(2) or (3) was given in accordance with that subsection; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) any person to whom the contents of the certificate have been disclosed for the purposes of the hearing; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) any other specified person; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        must not, except in permitted circumstances, disclose the information (whether in the proceeding or otherwise). 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The court may, regardless of the form of the information, order under this subsection that any person may disclose the information in the proceeding. However, the information is only admissible in evidence in the proceeding if, apart from the order, it is admissible. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) After holding a hearing required under subsection 28(5), the court must order that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the prosecutor or defendant must not call the person as a witness in the federal criminal proceeding; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the prosecutor or defendant may call the person as a witness in the federal criminal proceeding. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (7) The Court must, in deciding what order to make under this section, consider the following matters: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) whether, having regard to the Attorney-General’s certificate, there would be a risk of prejudice to national security if: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) where the certificate was given under subsection 26(2) or (3) – the information were disclosed in contravention of the certificate; or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) where the certificate was given under subsection 28(2) – the witness were called; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) whether any such order would have a substantial adverse effect on the defendant’s right to receive a fair hearing, including in particular on the conduct of his or her defence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) any other matter the court considers relevant. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (8) In making its decision, the Court must give greatest weight to the matter mentioned in paragraph (7)(a).” 
        
       
      
    15 The phrase “substantial adverse effect”, which appears in s 31(7)(b), is defined in s 7 to mean “an effect that is adverse and not insubstantial, insignificant or trivial”. 
     
      
    16 Although the phrase “risk of prejudice to national security” is not defined, a cognate phrase is defined in s 17: 
     
      
       
        
        “17 A disclosure of national security information is  
        likely to prejudice national security 
         if there is a real, and not merely a remote, possibility that the disclosure will prejudice national security.” 
        
       
      
    17 It is also pertinent to note the express objects provision, s 3: 
     
      
       
        
        “3(1) The object of this Act is to prevent the disclosure of information in federal criminal proceedings and civil proceedings where the disclosure is likely to prejudice national security, except to the extent that preventing the disclosure would seriously interfere with the administration of justice. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) In exercising powers or performing functions under this Act, a court must have regard to the object of this Act.” 
        
       
      
    18 Finally s 19 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “19(1) The power of a court to control the conduct of a federal criminal proceeding, in particular with respect to abuse of process, is not affected by this Act, except so far as this Act expressly or impliedly provides otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) An order under section 31 does not prevent the court from later ordering that the federal criminal proceeding be stayed on a ground involving the same matter, including that an order made under section 31 would have a substantial adverse effect on a defendant’s right to receive a fair hearing. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The Interpretation of s 31(8) 
       
      
    19 Mr P Boulten SC, who appeared for the appellant, focused his constitutional submissions on s 31(8). The starting point for any analysis must be the interpretation of that provision. 
     
      
    20 The difficulty that arises is the use of the superlative, “greatest”. If the sub section had referred to “great weight” the issue now agitated before the Court would probably not have arisen at all. 
     
      
    21 In Mr Boulten’s submission, this provision constitutes an impermissible usurpation of judicial power because, as a matter of practical reality, the executive certificate, together with the usual supporting evidence, would determine whether or not disclosure is made. A trial judge simply would not have, Mr Boulten submitted, the capacity to formulate an independent judgment about the degree of threat to national security and, save in the case of fanciful claims, would not, as a practical matter, be able to act in any other manner than to enforce the certificate. 
     
      
    22 Accordingly, although in form the legislation purports to confer a discretionary judgment to be exercised by the trial judge, in substance the certificate together with the supporting evidence will prove to be determinative, save in the case of fanciful claims of a risk to national security.  
     
      
    23 Mr Boulten also submitted that, in such a context the public may perceive the Courts to be acting in accordance with the wishes of the Executive branch of Government rather than pursuant to an unimpeded exercise of judicial power.  
     
      
    24 With regard to Mr Boulten’s submission that the legislative scheme is such that in substance, albeit not in form, a certificate and supporting evidence will prove determinative, s 31(8) is not distinctive in that regard. Such difficulties often arise in public interest immunity claims, particularly where issues of national security are involved. 
     
      
    25 Mr H Burmester QC, who appeared for the Attorney General, relied on two provisions which, he submitted, minimise any interference with the administration of justice associated with the tilting of the balance in the formulation of the judgment for which s 31(8) calls and the exercise of the discretion to make an order under s 31(2) or s 31(4). 
     
      
    26 The first provision upon which Mr Burmester relied is s 19 which acknowledges the ability of the Court to stay proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process. However, as Mr Boulten also submitted, this ultimate power does not allow for the situation in which an adverse impact occurs on the fairness of the trial, but the relevant imperfection is not such as to justify a stay. 
     
      
    27 Mr Boulten’s submission should be accepted in this respect. Although the Court’s power to order a stay of proceedings to prevent abuse of its process is acknowledged, it is a power that is rarely exercised, particularly where criminal proceedings are instituted with respect to charges of a serious character, as will often be the case where issues of national security arise. This ultimate fallback power is not entitled to significant consideration in determining whether or not this legislative scheme impermissibly intrudes upon the exercise of judicial power. 
     
      
    28 The second provision upon which Mr Burmester relied is the Objects clause, s 3, in particular the requirement in s 3(2) that the Court must have regard to the object when exercising powers or performing functions. Section 3(1) is fully set out above. It states that the object of the Act is to protect national security, but to do so only to a limited extent. The limitation arises by reason of the words: “except to the extent that preventing the disclosure would seriously interfere with the administration of justice.” 
     
      
    29 Accordingly, when exercising the function of giving “greatest weight” to the “risk of prejudice to national security” a court must “have regard” to the object of the Act to avert such ‘prejudice’, but not absolutely. The avoidance of ‘prejudice’ is qualified wherever non-disclosure of information “would seriously interfere with the administration of justice.” 
     
      
    30 A statutory requirement to “have regard to” a specific matter, requires the Court to give the matter weight as a fundamental element in the decision making process. (R v Hunt; ex parte Sean Investments Pty Ltd (1979) 180 CLR 322 at 320; The Queen v Toohey; ex parte Meneling Station Pty Ltd (1982) 158 CLR 327 at 355 and 338; Zhang v Canterbury City Council [2001] NSWCA 167; (2001) 51 NSWLR 589 at 602, [71]-[73]). An equivalent formulation is that the matter so identified must be the focal point of the decision making process. (See Evans v Marmont (1997) 42 NSWLR 70 at 79-80; Zhang supra at [73].) 
     
      
    31 There is a tension between the objects clause and s 31(7) and (8). The reference in s 3(1) to “seriously interfere with the administration of justice” is capable of being regarded as coincident with the formulation “a substantial adverse effect on the defendant’s right to receive a fair hearing”. In my opinion, where there is a “substantial adverse effect on the right to receive a fair hearing,” then it would be concluded that there had been a ‘serious interference with the administration of justice’. It is a difficult task to avoid prejudice to national security, whilst having regard to the proposition that that objective should not prevail where disclosure of information would seriously interfere with the administration of justice. Nevertheless, that is the task which Parliament has set for the Court. As I will indicate below, balancing incommensurable interests is a task to which courts are accustomed. 
     
      
    32 Mr Burmester also submitted that the word “greatest” is used for grammatical reasons. (Accepting the reasoning of Whealy J in R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 371; (2006) 163 A Crim R 448 at 469 [108]). Although the primary focus in s 31(7) is on the balancing of national security interests, to which par (a), refers and the right to receive a fair trial, to which (b) refers, par (c) permits the Court to take into account any other matter that it considers relevant.  
     
      
    33 As a matter of grammar this submission is correct. If only (a) and (b) had been present in subs (7) then the formulation in subs (8) would have used the word “greater”, rather than “greatest”. In a case, such as the present, where in substance the relevant balancing exercise is between pars (a) and (b), that is how subs (8) should be construed. 
     
      
    34 Mr Burmester, on the basis of the interpretation he advocated, submitted that the degree of interference with the exercise of the judicial power is lower than that submitted by the appellant. In particular he submitted that, in circumstances where there was a substantial adverse effect on the right to receive a fair trial, but the risk of prejudice to national security was “low”, then the trial judge in giving “greatest weight” or “greater weight” to the latter would still order disclosure.35 Mr Burmester drew the Court’s attention to the fact that, with respect to particular documents, that is precisely what Whealy J did in the present case. His Honour did order disclosure of certain documents after making the judgment that the prejudice to national security was low. 
     
      
    36 The effect of s 31(8) was, in my opinion, accurately set out by Whealy J in Lodhi supra at [108]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[108] The mere fact that the legislation states that more weight, that is the greater weight, is to be given to one factor over another does not mean that the other factor is to be disregarded. The use of the expression ‘greatest weight’ appears to be grammatically correct since the legislation is contemplating three (or more) considerations. Nor do I consider that the discretion is an exercise that, as was argued, will almost inevitably lead to one result namely, prevention of disclosure. Mr Boulten SC described it as ‘filling in the dots’. I cannot agree with this description. Read fairly, it seems to me that the legislation does no more than to give the Court guidance as to the comparative weight it is to give one factor when considering it alongside a number of others. Yet the discretion remains intact and, particularly for the reasons I have outlined, it seems to me that there is no warrant for supposing other than that, in a proper case, the Court will order disclosure or a form of disclosure other than that preferred by the Attorney-General. The legislation does not intrude upon the customary vigilance of the trial judge in a criminal trial. One of the court’s tasks is to ensure that the accused is not dealt with unfairly. This has extended traditionally into the area of public interest immunity claims. I see no reason why the same degree of vigilance, perhaps even at a higher level, would not apply to the Court’s scrutiny of the Attorney’s certificate in a s 31 hearing.” 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Burmester’s submission on the grammatical requirement to use the word “greatest”, based on Whealy J’s approach, provides an important corrective to the connotation that the use of the superlative would otherwise invoke. Relevantly, s 31(8) should be applied as if it said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In making its decision, the Court must give greater weight to the matter mentioned in paragraph (7)(a) than to the matter mentioned in paragraph (7)(b).” 
        
       
      
    38 This interpretation is of considerable significance for the determination of the constitutional issue before the Court. It is not only where, as Whealy J held with respect to particular documents in the present case, “the risk of prejudice to national security” is assessed to be “low” that subs (7)(b) may outweigh subs (7)(a), notwithstanding subs (8). There may be a significant risk of such prejudice but, even giving that consideration “greater weight”, the extent of “adverse effect on the defendant’s right to receive a fair hearing” may be such that disclosure is required. 
     
      
    39 On this interpretation of s 31(8), no constitutional issue arises. In my opinion, however, even if the superlative was given a substantive, rather that a grammatical application, the subsection would still be valid.  
     
      
       
      The Balancing Exercise 
       
      
    40 Section 31(7) and (8) require the Court to consider disparate matters, relevantly risk of prejudice to national security and the effect on the defendant’s right to receive a fair hearing, giving “greatest weight” to the former. This involves a broad evaluative judgment of a character that is often referred to in terms of the metaphor of “balancing”. (See generally Frank M Coffin “Judicial Balancing: the Protean Scales of Justice” (1980) 63 New York University Law Review 16.) Such balancing involves comparison between conflicting interests that are, in their essence, incommensurable. As Justice Scalia put it, this is like asking “whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy”. (Bendix Autolite Corp v Mid Wesco Enterprises Inc 486 US 888 (1988) at 897) 
     
      
    41 Although the ultimate task to be performed is one of balancing, s 31(8) does tilt the balance or put a thumb on the scales. However, this is only one of many possible ways in which common law principles or legislative provisions can guide the task of balancing conflicting interests. The existence of such guidance, even if it can be said to tilt the balance in favour of a particular decision, does not fundamentally alter the task. For purposes of assessing the constitutional propositions upon which the appellant relied, it is important to recognise that tilting the balance by some form of guidance is perfectly consistent with the traditional judicial decision making process.  
     
      
    42 That this is the case is perhaps best illustrated by the fact that common law principles developed by the courts may also involve a tilting of the balance. For example in Hinch v Attorney General of Victoria (1987) 164 CLR 15, the High Court considered the balancing exercise required by the principle expressed in Ex Parte Bread Manufacturers Ltd; v Re Truth and Sportsman Ltd (1937) 37 SR (NSW) 242 at 249-250. The Bread Manufacturers defence requires the Court in contempt proceedings to balance competing public interests between the administration of justice, on the one hand, and freedom of expression on the other.  
     
      
    43 In this context Wilson J, after reviewing the relevant case law concluded in Hinch at 41-42: 
     
      
       
        
        “But it is important to emphasise that in undertaking a balancing exercise the court does not start with the scales evenly balanced.  
        The law has already tilted the scales 
        . In the interests of the due administration of justice it will curb freedom of speech, but only to the extent that is necessary to prevent a real and substantial prejudice to the administration of justice”. [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    44 His Honour also said at 43: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, there are some respects in which the law has already decreed a freedom to the media to publish prejudicial material e.g. in the freedom to publish fair reports of preliminary court proceedings, including bail applications and committal proceedings. But this freedom is strictly circumscribed, reflecting the strength of the law’s concern to protect the due administration of justice from unjustifiable interference. Generally speaking, it is for a court, in determining whether impugned conduct should be condemned and punished as a contempt of court, to engage in a balancing exercise between competing public interests. Nevertheless,  
        the law provides guidance of the kind I have indicated in determining the relative weight 
         to be accorded to the factors which in a particular case may require consideration.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
       
      Note the express adoption of the observations of Wilson J with respect to the tilting of the scales in  
      Attorney General of New South Wales v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd 
       (1990) 20 NSWLR 368 at 384). 
      
    45 This tilting or “thumb on the scales” approach to a balancing exercise does not involve the formulation of a rule which determines the outcome in the process. Although the provision of guidance, or an indication of weight, will affect the balancing exercise, it does not change the nature of the exercise. (See also Attorney General of New South Wales v X [2000] NSWCA 199; (2000) 49 NSWLR 653 especially at [65]-[66], [71], [81]-[84].)  
     
      
    46 It may be that the interposition of a rule or standard applicable before the process of balancing is undertaken will lead to the conclusion that the process does not involve a balancing exercise at all. However, that is not the case where the common law principle or statute identifies one interest as more important than another in a particular context.  
     
      
    47 To give more weight to one matter over another is a task that is often performed in the course of balancing conflicting interests. (See V Luizzi “Balancing of interests in Courts” (1980) 20 Jurimetrics Journal 373 especially at 387-390.) I also agree with the author’s observation at 373 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although we may all recognise the difficulties of balancing the conflicting interests of parties and citizens, we all share a common intuitive grasp of, or at least are in agreement about, what the metaphor of balancing interests entails.” 
        
       
      
    48 The formulation by judges of guidance for the conduct of a balancing exercise between incommensurable interests is a process for which there is some analogy to the legislative task. As Benjamin Cardozo said of a judge engaged in such a process: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you ask how he is to know when one interest outweighs another, I can only answer that he must get his knowledge just as the legislator gets it, from experience and study and reflection; in brief, from life itself. Here, indeed, is the point of contact between the legislator’s work and his. The choice of methods, the appraisement of values, must in the end be guided by like considerations for the one as for the other. Each indeed is legislating within the limits of his competence. No doubt the limits for the judge are narrower. He legislates only between gaps. He fills the open spaces in the law.” ( 
        The Nature of the Judicial Process 
        , (1921) Yale University Press New Haven and London at 113). 
        
       
       
      The analogy between this kind of judicial task and the legislative task is pertinent to the issue of constitutional validity. 
       
       
      Legislative Usurpation 
       
      
    49 The separation of powers issue which arises on the submissions in the present case is whether the NSI Act, especially by force of s 31(8), does “usurp or infringe” (Liyanage v The Queen [1967] 1 AC 259 at 289), the judicial power of the Commonwealth which Ch III of the Constitution vests exclusively in the judiciary, including in State courts exercising federal jurisdiction.  
     
      
    50 One test is to consider whether the “legislation in question interferes with the judicial process itself”. (Australian Building Construction Employees’ and Builders Labourers’ Federation v The Commonwealth (1986) 161 CLR 88 at 96; quoted with approval in H A Bachrach Pty Ltd v Queensland [1998] HCA 54; (1998) 195 CLR 547 at 563 [19] and see 564 [21]. 
     
      
    51 Alternatively to the language of “usurpation” or interference, Liyanage has been referred to as authority for a test of whether the legislature “attempted to circumscribe the judicial process.” (See Australian Building Construction Employees’ supra at 96, not quoted in Bachrach supra). This terminology was adopted by Mason J in The Queen v Humby; ex parte Rooney (1973) 129 CLR 231. His Honour referred to Liyanage and said at 250: 
     
      
       
        
        “The legislation in question was of an unusual character, it constituted a marked interference with the judicial process and circumscribed the judicial function and the discretions incidental to it.” 
        
       
      
    52 Can it be said that s 31(8) impermissibly usurps, interferes with or circumscribes a discretion incidental to the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth?  
     
      
    53 Perhaps the most frequently cited test for legislative usurpation is “a law which requires or authorises the courts … to exercise judicial power in a manner which is inconsistent with the essential character of a court or with the nature of judicial power”. (Chu Kheng Lim v Minister of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 27 per Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ) Their Honours concluded that it would be an “impermissible intrusion into the judicial power … for the Parliament to purport to direct the courts as to the manner and outcome of the exercise of their jurisdiction”. (Chu Kheng Lim supra at 37.) 
     
      
    54 Can it be said that s 31(8) impermissibly requires the exercise of judicial power in a manner inconsistent with the essential character of a court, or that it purports to direct the courts as to the manner of the exercise of their jurisdiction? 
     
      
    55 The most recent formulation of this principle is in the joint judgment of Gummow and Crennan JJ in Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; (2007) 81 ALJR 1414 at [111], with whom Callinan J (at [600]) and Heydon J (at [651]) relevantly agreed: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [I]t may be accepted for present purposes that legislation which requires a court exercising federal jurisdiction to depart to a significant degree from the methods and standards which have characterised judicial activities in the past may be repugnant to  
        Ch III 
        .” 
        
       
      
    56 Can it be said that s 31(8) departs to a significant degree from “the methods and standards” of traditional judicial activity? 
     
      
    57 Various statements appear in the authorities identifying the essential characteristics of the judicial process, which the Parliament cannot modify without infringing the separation of powers in Ch III of the Constitution. (See eg. R v Trade Practices Tribunal; ex parte Tasmanian Breweries Pty Ltd (1970) 123 CLR 361 at 374; Fencott v Muller (1983) 152 CLR 570 at 608; Harris v Caladine (1991) 172 CLR 84 at 150; Bass v Permanent Trustee Company Ltd [1999] HCA 9; (1999) 198 CLR 334 at [45]-[46], [56]. Legislation which tilts the balancing exercise involved in the equivalent of determining a public interest immunity claim does not, in my opinion, fall within any of these statements.  
     
      
    58 The case which is closest to the issue raised on this appeal is Nicholas v The Queen [1998] HCA 9; (1998) 193 CLR 173, where the High Court upheld the constitutional validity of legislation permitting the admissibility of evidence obtained in circumstances where law enforcement officers had committed a criminal offence in a “controlled operation”. The legislation limited the exercise of the Court’s discretion to exclude such unlawfully obtained evidence, a discretion affirmed by the High Court in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19.  
     
      
    59 The limitation enacted as s 15X of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), and upheld in Nicholas, was directed, in terms, to the admissibility of evidence. It relevantly provided: “In determining … whether evidence that narcotic goods were imported … should be admitted, the fact that a law enforcement officer committed an offence … is to be disregarded …” if certain conditions are met. Section 15X was of significance for controlled operations which occurred before commencement of the Act, other provisions of which had the effect of decriminalising the involvement of a law enforcement officer in a later controlled operation. 
     
      
    60 Section 15X did not abolish the relevant discretion. It removed an element, albeit a particularly pertinent, indeed critical, element, from the process of exercising the discretion. 
     
      
    61 Four of the majority judgments in Nicholas (Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gummow and Hayne JJ) emphasised that s 15X limited the discretion of the Court to exclude evidence and that the common law of evidence had often been changed by legislation. (See at [23]-[24], [25]-[26], [53], [55], [151]. [161]-[162], [235]-[236], [238].)  
     
      
    62 The obtaining of evidence is the principal legitimate forensic purpose of a subpoena to produce documents, and the approach applicable to the admissibility of evidence offers a close analogy to the present case. Like s 15X considered in Nicholas, s 31(8) of the NSI Act, is a rule which limits the discretion of the court, relevantly, with respect to access to documents as distinct from admissibility. The reasoning of the majority judgments in Nicholas is, in my opinion, applicable. Disclosure of documents involves a matter of procedure, which has also frequently been amended by legislation. 
     
      
    63 This conclusion is reinforced by the emphasis in the four majority judgments in Nicholas to the effect that the discretion, upon which the legislation impinged, involved the balancing of conflicting public policy considerations. Their Honours accepted that the alteration of the way the balance should be struck in that case did not constitute an impermissible usurpation of the judicial power ([35]-[36], [55], [159]-[160], [164], [234], [244]).  
     
      
    64 As Gummow J put it at [160]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The legislature has now … struck a different balance between these competing interests.” 
        
       
      
    65 And as Hayne J said at [238]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of this particular discretion, the exercise of which depends upon the balancing of competing considerations, I see no intrusions on the judicial power by the legislature saying that in some kinds of case, one consideration (that of preserving the reputation of the courts by their not being seen to condone law breaking) is to be put to one side in favour of the consideration that persons committing a particular kind of crime should be convicted and punished.” 
        
       
      
    66 A similar approach is, in my opinion applicable to s 31(8) of the NSI Act. The legislature has “struck a different balance”. It has, to some degree, “put to one side” the public and private interest in obtaining all potentially relevant information, “in favour of” the public interest in national security. This, in my opinion, is constitutionally permissible. 
     
      
    67 I have discussed the process of balancing competing interests above. As I have noted, in certain areas the common law has tilted the balance. Doing so does not alter the essential quality of the task being performed. If the legislature tilts the balance in some way, it cannot be said that doing so is “inconsistent with the essential character of a court or with the nature of judicial power” (Chu Kheng Lim); nor that it interferes with the judicial process itself or “circumscribes a discretion incidental to the judicial process” (Australian Building Construction Employees’); nor that it constitutes, a “direction to the courts as to the manner of the exercises of jurisdiction” (Chu Kheng Lim); nor that it requires the court “to depart to a significant degree from the methods and standards which have characterised judicial activity” (Thomas v Mowbray). 
     
      
    68 Claims for public interest immunity require the balancing of the public interest in non-disclosure against the public interest in the administration of justice, reflecting the cognate private interest to ensure disclosure of all facts which may directly or indirectly be relevant to a trial. The statutory scheme of the NSI Act is analogous to such a claim. 
     
      
    69 It is characteristic of all the forms of privilege which the common law has long recognised, that potentially relevant facts will be withheld from a litigant. A successful claim of public interest immunity is one example of such an effect. The legislative tilting of the balance, accepted in Nicholas is, in this respect, similar to the tilting of the balance by s 31(8) of the NSI Act. 
     
      
    70 The final aspect of the majority judgments in Nicholas, to which I wish to draw attention are the references to the protection of “the integrity of the judicial process.” (See at [37], [167], [234], [286], [239], [240].) In particular, Gummow J said at [167]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [V]iews of public policy may differ, as the judgments in the divided Court in  
        Ridgeway 
         demonstrate. For the legislature to prefer one such view to another is not, of itself, to undermine, in a constitutionally impermissible manner, the integrity of the judicial process in the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth.”  
        
       
      
    71 This emphasis on integrity of the judicial process is similar to the emphasis now given to institutional integrity with respect to the cognate principle applicable to powers or functions that are incompatible with the exercise of judicial power. (See Fardon v Attorney General of Queensland [2004] HCA 46; (2004) 223 CLR 575 at [15], [23], [37], [101], [219]). Indeed Gummow J described “institutional integrity” as the “touchstone” of this principle. (See also Powercoal Pty Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales [2005] NSWCA 345; (2005) 64 NSWLR 406 at [42]-[45]). 
     
      
    72 The modification of judicial procedures by legislation should not be characterised as a legislative usurpation of judicial power, unless it affects the integrity of the judicial process. As noted above, in certain contexts the common law tilts a balancing process without effect on the integrity of the process. Legislation can also do so, without necessarily having such an effect. 
     
      
    73 This focus on whether the integrity of the process has been compromised confirms the conclusion to which I have come above. Tilting the balance with respect to the formulation of a broad evaluative judgment, upon which reasonable minds may differ, does not impinge upon the integrity of the process by which the judgment is formed. It may affect the outcome of the process but not in such a way as to affect its integrity. 
     
      
       
      Right to a Fair Trial 
       
      
    74 The appellant, alternatively, relied upon what he described as the constitutional right to a fair trial. The authority upon which the appellant relied in this regard was the judgment of Deane J in Dietrich v The Queen (1992) 177 CLR 292 at 326. This passage has not been authoritatively adopted. The High Court has not recognised a right to a fair trial as a free standing right. 
     
      
    75 It is unnecessary to pursue this alternative argument in detail. In my opinion, even if there were such a constitutional right, s 31(8) would not constitute an infringement of it, for the same reasons I have given above for concluding that there was no legislative usurpation of the judicial process. 
     
      
    76 I repeat, and emphasise, that all claims for privilege, which the common law has long recognised, necessarily involve the withholding of potentially relevant evidence, even from defendants in a criminal trial. So, in Carter v Managing Partner, Northmore Hale Davy & Leake (1995) 183 CLR 121, a claim for legal professional privilege was upheld even where documents could establish the innocence of an accused or materially assist his defence. 
     
      
    77 A successful claim for public interest immunity does not contradict such right to a fair trial as may exist under the Constitution. The legislative tilting of the balancing process by s 31(8) of that Act, in my opinion, does not constitute so significant a change as to have such an effect.  
     
      
       
      The Sentence Appeal 
       
      
    78 The facts and submissions relevant to the sentence appeal are set out by Price J whose judgment I have read in draft. Subject to the following observations I agree with his Honour’s judgment. 
     
      
    79 The sentence imposed is a substantial one, particularly in view of the fact that there was no actual injury to persons or property. Nevertheless, as Price J emphasises, the provisions creating the offence are directed to preparatory acts and the seriousness with which Parliament regards such acts is manifest in the maximum penalty. By the extended range of conduct which is subject to criminal sanction, going well beyond conduct hitherto generally regarded as criminal, and by the maximum penalties provided, the Parliament has indicated that, in contemporary circumstances, the threat of terrorist activity, requires condign punishment. 
     
      
    80 The statutory guidepost for the exercise of the sentencing discretion is provided by s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): 
     
      
       
        
        “16A(1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    81 The very generality of the language – “a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence” – indicates the breadth of the discretion conferred upon the sentencing judge. In this formulation the Parliament has indicated that the sentencing principles developed at common law, rather than the various provisions in State legislation, should apply to sentencing for Commonwealth offences. (See Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [15].) 
     
      
    82 The Australian common law of sentencing is based on the principle of proportionality which requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime. The basic authority in this regard remains Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. The references in the joint judgment in that case to the protection of society are of particular significance for purposes of the exercise of the sentencing discretion in a case such as the present. It is the weight that is appropriate to be given to this element that, in my opinion, justifies the significant sentence imposed by Whealy J upon the appellant.  
     
      
    83 The objective acts of the appellant, which did not go beyond collecting materials for future use, did not give rise to any imminent, let alone actual, threat of personal injury or damage to property. Such preparatory acts, even though criminalised, would not at first appear to justify so substantial a penalty. However, the position is different in the light of his Honour’s clear and justifiable findings of fact that the appellant has not resiled from the extremist intention with which these acts were performed.  
     
      
    84 As Price J notes, the issues involved in sentencing for offences of this character were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia in R v Roche [2005] WASCA 4; (2005) 188 FLR 336. I agree with the observations made by Price J about that judgment. 
     
      
    85 Roche was not, however, the first Court of Criminal Appeal to consider in detail sentencing principles relevant to crimes of this character. In R v Sakr (1987) 31 A Crim R 444 the Court of Criminal Appeal of Victoria was concerned with an offender who had placed explosive devices with intent to cause an explosion likely to endanger life or cause serious injury to property. The offence in that case was motivated by financial considerations and, accordingly, issues of personal deterrence were relevant in a manner which, for reasons I will discuss below, are not as pertinent to the offence presently under consideration.  
     
      
    86 In that context Crockett J said at 451: 
     
      
       
        
        “The use of bombs and explosives is the trademark of the terrorist, whose acts of lawlessness have engendered a special revulsion that is due not only to the fact that death is so often the intention of the perpetrator, but also because the recklessness with which the offence is, by its very nature, invested is so likely to lead to the loss of innocent lives and, less importantly, to the destruction of the property of innocent third persons. It is an offence that is callous in its conception, wanton in its perpetration and, if the intent is given effect to ruthlessly destructive in its aftermath. It is a crime that is relatively novel in this country, as I have already indicated, and yet it is plain that there is a community recognition that it is regarded with a particular repugnance because its commission represents a profound assault upon a stable society and the law and the law and order that is necessary for that society’s survival. Those responsible for such reprehensible conduct must expect to suffer condign punishment. 
        
       
       
        
        If ever there were a case in which the nature of the offence and the circumstances of its commission, called for a deterrent penalty, then this is that case. The court is justified in believing that the community would expect that the punishment to be imposed should mark its intention, so far as it might be within the power of the court to do so, to arrest the incipient growth of terrorist-style criminal activity in this community.” 
        
       
      
    87 I agree with these observations. The reference to deterrence in this passage was, no doubt, a reference to both general and specific deterrence. However, deterrence in both respects may, in many cases, be entitled to less weight whenever it appears, as the example of suicide bombers suggests, that the force of an ideological or religious motivation is such that deterrence is unlikely to work.  
     
      
    88 The crimes under consideration in the present case, in which the conduct must occur with the “intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause” (Div 100.1), together with the findings of fact made by Whealy J, suggest that deterrence is of less significance than usual. In such a context, the element of protection of the community is entitled to greater weight than may otherwise be appropriate.  
     
      
    89 In R v Martin (1999) 1 Cr App R (S) 477 at 480, Lord Bingham CJ, as the Senior Law Lord then was, said: “In passing sentence for the most serious terrorist offences, the object of the Court will be to punish, deter and incapacitate; rehabilitation is likely to play a minor (if any) part”. 
     
      
    90 In Roche McKechnie J, with whom Murray ACJ agreed, quoted this sentence at [112], and adopted as one of the sentencing principles applicable to a case of this character at [119]: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the most serious terrorist offences the sentence must be of a severity appropriate to the circumstances. The object of the sentence is to punish, deter and incapacitate.” 
        
       
      
    91 Although it is necessary to treat remarks made in a different statutory context with care I note that in R v Parole Board ex parte Smith [2005] UKHL 1 at [23] Lord Bingham referred to “the well-known objects of a custodial sentence (retribution, personal and general deterrence, incapacitation, reform, rehabilitation). But the predominant purpose of the sentence will be punitive …”. 
     
      
    92 I will refer below to some aspects of the debate about the role of incapacitation in the exercise of a sentencing discretion. However, for purposes of its application in Australian law, this element should be understood as encompassed by the element of “protection of the community”, recognised as a separate element by the High Court in Veen (No 2).  
     
      
    93 There is authority in Australia which suggests that “protection of the community” is an overall umbrella identifying the purpose of all of the different elements traditionally listed as matters to which consideration must be given in the exercise of a sentencing discretion. Those matters include punishment, general and specific deterrence, and rehabilitation, but not, in Australian authority, separate reference to an element of incapacitation. The authorities which adopt community protection as an umbrella, rather than as a separate element, include the frequently cited judgments of R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329 at 330, and The Queen v Radich [1954] NZLR 86 at 87. 
     
      
    94 However, the analysis by the High Court in Veen (No 2) clearly treats the element of protection of the community as separate. In Veen (No 2) the joint judgment expressly stated at 476: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case.” 
        
       
      
    95 Similarly at 477 the joint judgment referred to a particular circumstance in which: “retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted”. 
     
      
    96 The joint judgment made it clear that the principle of proportionality required the element of “protection of society” to be taken into account as a separate matter, but not in such a way as would fail to give appropriate weight to other factors. The joint judgment said at 473: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is one thing to say that the principle of proportionality precludes the imposition of a sentence extended beyond what is appropriate to the crime merely to protect society; it is another thing to say that the protection of society is not a material factor in fixing an appropriate sentence. The distinction in principle is clear between an extension merely by way of preventive detention, which is impermissible, and an exercise of the sentencing discretion having regard to the protection of society among other factors, which is permissible.” 
        
       
      
    97 The reference to “merely to protect society” and “merely by way of preventive detention” indicates that the “protection of society” is a relevant consideration and, in appropriate circumstances, will be entitled to weight. 
     
      
    98 Mason CJ, who was part of the majority in Veen (No 2), had made pertinent observations in the first case, which are consistent with the joint judgment in the second. His Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “The protection of the community from violent crime, it has always been recognized, is a very important factor to be taken into account in sentencing. It would be surprising if it were otherwise. The court must, in sentencing a person who has been convicted of a very serious offence involving violence, if his record and the expert evidence plainly demonstrate that there is a real likelihood of his committing that kind of offence again if he is restored to liberty, ensure by the order which it makes that he will not be released whilst that likelihood continues. If it should appear that the propensities or predilections of the person convicted are such that the imposition of life imprisonment is necessary to protect the community from violent harm, then the court should impose that penalty. In the case of a very serious offence involving violence, it will rarely transpire, if at all, that a sentence of life imprisonment is disproportionate to the offence of which the prisoner has been convicted, given that he has a prior record of conviction for that class of offence and that he has a propensity, because he is unstable or disordered, to commit violent crime. 
        
       
       
        
        In saying this it is not my intention to deny, or derogate from, the principle that the punishment to be inflicted must be proportionate to the crime. Rather it is my purpose to say that the conflict between that principle and the object of protecting the community arises in relation to less serious offences where the proportionality principle inhibits the imposition of a long term sentence which might otherwise be thought necessary to protect the community.” ( 
        Veen v The Queen

    99 Subsequent authority in the High Court similarly appears to regard protection of society as a distinct element.  
     
      
    100 In Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525 at [16] Mason CJ and McHugh J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … Factors such as deterrence of others from crime and the protection of society from the prisoner would assume a secondary importance to the individual welfare of the prisoner.” 
        
       
      
    101 In AB v The Queen [1999] HCA 46; (1999) 198 CLR 111 McHugh J said at [14]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Many, probably a large bulk of, sentences reflect compromises between conflicting objectives of sentencing. One objective is to impose a sentence that reflects adequate punishment for the culpability of the convicted person, having regard to the community’s view concerning the need for retribution, denunciation, deterrence, community protection and sometimes vindication.” 
        
       
      
    102 In Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at [147] Hayne J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [M]uch weight was to be given to considerations of denunciation and general deterrence  
        as well as to questions of community protection 
        .” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    103 In Fardon v Attorney General of Queensland [2004] HCA 46; (2004) 223 CLR 575 Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[20] … [A]s  
        Veen (No 2)  
        held, common law sentencing principles have long accepted protection of the community as a relevant sentencing consideration.” 
        
       
      
    104 To similar effect, in Thomas v Mowbray [2007] HCA 33; (2007) 81 ALJR 1414 at [109] Gummow and Crennan JJ quoted the first of the extracts I have quoted above from Veen (No 2) at 476 and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[109] The protection of the public as a purpose of decision-making is not alien to the adjudicative process. For example, it looms large in sentencing after the determination of criminal guilt.” 
        
       
      
    105 The reference in Veen (No 2) to preventive detention reflects a controversial aspect of the acceptance of incapacitation, being the terminology that Lord Bingham used in the context of sentencing for terrorist offences, which has been debated in the sentencing literature and in a number of judgments. (See e.g. Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at 305 per Kirby J.) 
     
      
    106 The difficulty of predicting future behaviour, which is in any event inherent in other sentencing principles including general and personal deterrence and rehabilitation, is often referred to as one of the defects of reliance on individual incapacitation as a basis for increasing the severity of a sentence. The other significant issue is the sense of unfairness of punishing a person not for what they have done, but for what they may do in the future. (See generally Franklin Zimring and Gordon Hawkins Incapacitation: Penal Confinement and the Restraint of Crime (1995) Oxford University Press, New York, at 62ff; Andrew Ashworth “Criminal Justice Act 2003 (2) Criminal Justice Reform: Principles Human Rights and Public Prosecutions” (2004) Criminal Law Review 516 esp at 519-521; Mirko Bagaric “Incapacitation, Deterrence and Rehabilitation: Flawed Ideals or Appropriate Sentencing Goals?” (2000) 20 Criminal Law Journal 21 esp at 28-29; Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew Ashworth Principled Sentencing: Readings on Theory and Policy (1998) Hart Publishing, Oxford Ch 3; Andrew Ashworth Sentencing and Criminal Justice 4th ed (2005) Cambridge University Press, Cambridge at 80ff.) 
     
      
    107 In this respect it is pertinent to note the observations of Gleeson CJ in Fardon supra at 589-590: 
     
      
       
        
        “The way in which the criminal justice system should respond to the case of the prisoner who represents a serious danger to the community upon release is an almost intractable problem. No doubt, predictions of future danger may be unreliable, but, as the case of  
        Veen  
        shows, they may also be right. Common law sentencing principles, and some legislative regimes, permit or require such predictions at the time of sentencing, which will often be many years before possible release. If, as a matter of policy, the unreliability of such predictions is a significant factor, it is not necessarily surprising to find a legislature attempting to postpone the time for prediction until closer to the point of release.” 
        
       
      
    108 In the context of the crimes presently under consideration, incapacitation does not merely refer to the prospect that in the future a particular offender will re-offend. With respect to the crime of preparation for terrorist acts the Court is not simply concerned with future criminal conduct of a recidivist character. It is concerned with the possibility of perfection of the very crime for the preparation of which the offender has been found guilty.  
     
      
    109 Accordingly, the issue is not merely one of punishing an offender for something s/he may do in the future. It is the recognition that the protection of society requires the offender to be prevented from perpetrating the offences which s/he was preparing to commit. Giving the element of protection of society substantial weight, particularly in a context where personal deterrence and rehabilitation are, given the nature of the offence and the findings of fact, entitled to little weight, is consistent with the principle of proportionality laid down in Veen (No 2). 
     
      
    110 For these reasons I agree that the sentences imposed were well within the exercise of the sentencing discretion by the sentencing judge. The protection of the community required a substantial sentence and his Honour was correct to impose one. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    111 For the above reasons I agree that the appeal should be dismissed.112 BARR J: The appellant, Faheem Khalid Lodhi, was tried before Whealy J and a jury on four charges, namely that -  
     
      
       
        
        1. On or about 3 October 2003 at Sydney he collected documents, namely two maps of the Australian electricity supply system, which were connected with preparation for a terrorist act, knowing the said connection; 
        
       
       
        
        2. On or about 10 October at Sydney he intentionally did an act in preparation for a terrorist act, namely sought information concerning the availability of materials capable of being used for the manufacture of explosives or incendiary devices; 
        
       
       
        
        3. On or about 24 October 2003 at Sydney he made documents, namely a set of aerial photographs of certain Australian defence establishments, which were connected with preparation for a terrorist act, knowing the said connection; and 
        
       
       
        
        4. On or about 26 October 2003 at Sydney he possessed a thing, namely a document containing information concerning the ingredients for and the method of manufacture of poisons, explosives, detonators and incendiary devices and concerning “intelligence” which was connected with preparation for a terrorist act, knowing the said connection.  
        
       
      
    113 The jury found the appellant guilty of the offences charged in the first, second and fourth counts and not guilty of the offence charged in the third count.  
     
      
    114 His Honour sentenced the appellant to twenty years’ imprisonment on the first count and ten years’ imprisonment on each of the second and fourth counts, each sentence to commence at the same time. There was thus an effective sentence of twenty years’ imprisonment. His Honour fixed a non-parole period of fifteen years.  
     
      
    115 The appellant appeals against the convictions and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    116 The facts found by his Honour were as follows: [2006] NSWSC 691 at [8] – [36] - 
     
      
       
        
         
        In mid-May 2003 a French citizen, one Willie Brigitte, arrived in Australia. This man, I accept, had trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba paramilitary training camp in Pakistan in late 2001. One of his fellow trainees, Yong Ke Kwon, gave evidence in the trial about his own training at the Lashkar-e-Taiba camp and his meeting there and relationship with a man he knew as Salahudin. He identified Salahudin from a photograph of Willie Brigitte shown to him in November 2003. The organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba has now been prescribed as a terrorist organisation by the Australian Government and it is also regarded in this light by the Government of Pakistan. Its primary focus is on the removal of Indian security forces from India controlled Kashmir. But it has a broader interest in terrorism generally and may, perhaps, have had some links with the terrorist organisation al-Qaeda. It is clear, however, that military and religious training occurred in the Le-T camp attended by both Brigitte and Kwon; and that the training related not only to the local situation but was intended to aid in the battle against oppression of Muslim communities elsewhere.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There is very little detailed evidence about Willie Brigitte’s activities while he was here in Australia. This much however is clear: a few days before he arrived in Australia, the offender set up a mobile phone service in a false name. It has been referred to throughout the trial as the “Sam Praveen” telephone service. Two calls were made from Willie Brigitte’s phone in France to the Sam Praveen telephone service. The first occurred on 7 May 2003, a day or so after the offender had obtained the service. The second of these calls was made on 13 May 2003, the day before Brigitte left France for Australia. There was also evidence to show that, although the offender had never met Willie Brigitte, arrangements had been made for him to meet and collect him on the day of his arrival in Sydney. This is, in fact, what happened and two the men spent most of the day together.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The connecting link between the offender and Willie Brigitte appears to be a somewhat shadowy figure in Pakistan known to both men. His name was “Sajid”. The offender said he met him in Pakistan at a mosque during visits there in 2002 and 2003. The offender said it was Sajid who asked him to look after Willie Brigitte on his arrival in Australia. I have no doubt that this was so. I do not accept, however, that the relationship between the two men was an innocent one, as the offender endeavoured to explain it. His version was that he gave assistance to Willie Brigitte as a matter of courtesy to a stranger travelling in a new country; and that he did so at the behest of a mutual friend who had asked that such courtesy be extended. In my view, the evidence establishes that Sajid was endeavouring to co-ordinate a liaison between the offender and Willie Brigitte in Sydney so that, in general terms, the prospect of terrorist actions in Australia could be explored.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I should say immediately that there is no evidence to indicate precisely what Brigitte’s role was to be in relation to any terrorist activity. There is no evidence to indicate, for example, that he himself was to be involved in the commission of any of the three offences in respect of which the offender has been found guilty. But there was a continuing association between the offender and Willie Brigitte during his short stay in Australia. This is exemplified by a number of calls made by an Australian Mobile phone service associated with Brigitte (again in a false name, known during the trial as the “John Huck” telephone service) to the “Sam Praveen” telephone service.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There is also evidence that Willie Brigitte’s French telephone service made approximately nineteen telephone calls to Sajid in Pakistan before Brigitte left for Australia. After Willie Brigitte’s detention and deportation from Australia, there was evidence that the offender telephoned Sajid’s telephone number from a public phone box in Campsie. This occurred after the offender had been at an Internet Café with one Abdul Rakib Hasan. Hasan, who worked in a Halal butcher’s shop at Lakemba, also knew Brigitte.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There was also evidence that the offender and Hasan visited Brigitte at his flat at Boorea Avenue, Lakemba on at least two occasions. Although the evidence does not enable me to discover the details of what transpired between the offender and Willie Brigitte, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the relationship was not an innocent one. I am also satisfied that the connecting link between the two men was their joint interest in contemplating and discussing the possibility of some type of terrorist activity in Australia. This association came to an abrupt end in October 2003 in circumstances that achieved considerable notoriety in the Australian media. French authorities had notified Australian Intelligence that Brigitte had a substantial connection with terrorism and this, so it appears, led to his sudden detention and swift deportation from Australia to France. It seems that he is still in France awaiting determination as to whether he is to face terrorism charges under the laws in that country relating to his activities in France or elsewhere. Brigitte gave no evidence in the trial.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A little under a week before Brigitte’s detention took place, the offender obtained a desk map and a wall map of the electrical supply system from Energy Supply at Level 6, 208 Pitt Street Sydney. He told Ms Bakla, who worked for the organisation, that he was starting a business and that he wanted to place a wall map in his office. The offender was asked to fill out a form giving his name, address and company name. The name he wrote down was “M Rasul”. His position was given as “partner”; and the company name as “Rasul Electrical”. The postal address given was “Post Office Box 2359 Smithfield”. The telephone number, which was altered by Ms Bakla to include an additional 9, was 9230.051.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        There was no contest at trial that it was, in fact, the offender who made these enquiries and that it was he who was supplied with the maps. The offender explained before the jury that his obtaining of the maps had nothing whatsoever to do with terrorist related activities. In fact, he said that he wanted them for a business of an electrical nature he was proposing to establish. The offender expressly disclaimed any intention that these maps were connected with, or in any way involved in or part of any plot, to carry out a terrorist act against the Electricity Supply System. The offender also explained why he filled out the application form in the way he did. The Post Office Box address and the telephone number were simply errors. The name “Rasul” or “Mohamed Rasul” was to be part of the name he proposed to give the electrical company when it was established.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Consistently with the jury’s verdicts, I find that these explanations and excuses were untrue. The real reason the offender gave a false name, telephone number and address was that he did not want his own identity to be known. This was because his plain purpose in securing the maps related to an intention he held at the time to use the maps in connection with a proposal for an enterprise that would involve bombing part of the Australian Electricity Supply System.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Not only did the offender intend to use the maps for this purpose when he collected them, it was also his intention that any bombing of the electrical system by the detonation of a homemade explosive or incendiary device would be done to advance the cause of violent jihad and be carried out so as to intimidate the Government of Australia and the Australian public.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The offender’s association with Willie Brigitte and the man Sajid in Pakistan were not the only matters relevant to the existence of these intentions. There was also found in his possession a significant amount of material which threw considerable light on his intentions in relation to these offences. The material included a CD-Rom which was described, throughout the trial, as the “jihadi CD”. This was a virtual library containing exhortations to violent jihad, justifications for suicide bombings (called “martyrdom” in the text of the material), and which extolled the virtues of those who had given their lives to the murder of innocent civilians and others in the name of extremist Islam. Much of the material exhorted the reader or listener to follow, or at least support violent jihad. In addition to this CD, there were two volumes of the Lion of Allah, other material and Chechnyan videocassette glorifying those who had given their lives in the fight between Chechnya and Russia.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The offender told the jury that he had never seen the “jihadi CD” and that he could not explain its presence in the material found near his computer at home. Although he acknowledged the existence of some of the other material I have mentioned, he explained that he had either not seen it or, if he had seen it, it was only in part and that he had generally little to do with the contents.  
         
        20 I do not accept these explanations. Nor do I accept the offender’s attempts to distance himself from the material so obviously found in his possession. Rather, I think the truth is that all this material makes it clear that the offender is a person who has, in recent years, been essentially informed by the concept of violent jihad and the glorification of Muslim heroes who have fought and died for jihad, either in a local or broader context. The material is eloquent as to the ideas and emotions that must have been foremost in the offender’s mind throughout October 2003 and later, at least until the time of his arrest.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Although these specific intentions were, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, at the forefront of the offender’s mind when he collected the maps, it seems clear that he had not at that stage necessarily made a final determination as to the precise target, or the precise area of the target, that was to be hit. Indeed, the maps themselves would not have given sufficient information to the offender. Nor would they, of themselves, have given sufficient insight into how such an attack upon the electrical system could be maintained. They were, however, a starting point for a terrorist related enterprise potentially of some considerable magnitude.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Of further relevance to this first offence, and indeed, to each offence found proven against the offender, was the material located at his workstation during the execution of a search warrant on 26 October 2003. This comprised 15 pages of carefully written out handwriting in the Urdu language, or at least in the Urdu script. It was not disputed that this document was in the handwriting of the offender. He explained that, many years earlier, he had seen this material written in English on a computer he was using at University during the course of his studies. Although he maintained that the information was of no special interest to him, it is obvious that he must have spent several hours writing out the material he selected from the computer screen. He then kept it in his possession for a considerable time afterwards. The offender maintained that he had forgotten about this material and that it had found its way to his workplace by accident, as it were.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I reject the offender’s explanation for the possession of this document. Moreover, I find that its contents were central to his thinking and state of mind at least during 2003 and thereafter. The offender’s attempt to explain or justify his possession of this material was simply incredible.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        These 15 pages were fairly described by the Crown in its submissions before the jury as “a terrorism manual for the manufacture of homemade poisons, explosives, detonators and incendiary devices”. Although the recipes were not particularly sophisticated or scientific, they included formulas for homemade grenades, petrol bombs and, relevantly for this present purpose, an explosive device containing an explosive known as urea nitrate. This particular explosive could be easily made, as the evidence of Dr Spears and Mr Taylor showed during the trial. Once detonated, it had the capacity for significant damage to property and for substantial loss of life for those who may have been in the vicinity when the explosion occurred. This situation, of course, would depend on the size of the urea nitrate parcel detonated.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Throughout the trial, a central issue for the jury’s determination had been the state of mind or the intentions of the offender. The contents of these documents, Exhibit “G” and its English translation Exhibit “H”, make it plain beyond reasonable doubt that, when he collected the wall maps from Ms Bakla at Energy Supply, the subject of homemade bombs or explosives was likely to have been at the forefront of his thinking.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that the offender had at any time made up his mind that it would be he who would carry out the bombing of the Australian Electrical Supply System. Indeed, I am perfectly satisfied that the proposal had not reached the stage where the identity of a bomber, the precise area to be bombed or the manner in which the bombing would take place, had been worked out. The obtaining of the electrical maps was at a very preliminary stage indeed, a matter, which the Crown accepted throughout the presentation of its case to the jury.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The day after Willie Brigitte’s detention commenced, the offender exchanged faxes with one Melissa Phelps. She was an employee of Deltrex Chemicals. Here again, he used a false name and a fictitious address. The fax-headed sheet he created was this time that of a non-existent business called “Eagle Flyers”. It had a Post Office box “2286 Smithfield”. This was a fictitious business identity in all respects although, of course, the fax number of the firm of Thomson Adsett Architects was given to Ms Phelps. It is also of interest to note that the offender, in making the enquiry, spelt his first name differently from its usual spelling; and he signed his name with a signature which was not his usual signature.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The offender told Ms Phelps that he was going to start up a detergent business. He gave Ms Phelps a list of the chemicals he wanted. Ultimately a price list for certain chemicals was sent by Ms Phelps to “Fahim” at Thomson Adsett. It became Exhibit “J” in the trial. The price list contained and included chemicals which were to be found on the Urdu document Exhibit “G”. In particular, the list gave prices for minimum quantities of urea and nitric acid, the components for a urea nitrate homemade bomb.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Exhibit “J” was not however received by the offender. It found its way to Ms Kenny, his superior, at work. Ms Kenny confronted the offender. She asked him whether the document had anything to do with his work. He told her that it did not. It has to do, he said, with his family company. He explained to her that his fax was broken and he needed to use the work fax for “family company business”.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Before the jury, the offender gave a similar explanation. He explained that he had a proposal for exporting chemicals to Pakistan. Indeed, there was other evidence in the trial, from his family in Pakistan and other people, that at one stage he had contemplated some sort of business venture, which would involve the exporting of certain chemicals from Australia.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that the explanation given to the jury for the offender’s obtaining the price list of chemicals from Deltrex Chemicals was a false explanation. The truth of the matter was that he wanted the information to assist in his proposal for planning and carrying out a bombing enterprise within Australia as part of a terrorist act. Again, it is quite possible, as at 10 October 2003, that the offender may well have still had in contemplation the bombing of part of the Electrical Supply System. It is not possible to say, however, that when the enquiries were made of Deltrex Chemicals, the precise target had been selected. As before, it is clear that the planning was at a very preliminary stage. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended that he himself would necessarily assemble the bomb or that he would be the bomb carrier when it came time to place it at or near the ultimate target. But I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his role in the enterprise was an important one. This is evidenced by the fact that it was he who was making the enquiry to Deltrex Chemicals, albeit using a false name. Once again the offender gave an explanation as to why he used the name “Eagle Flyers”. Once again, he claimed that a mistake had simply been made in the postal address.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I do not accept these explanations as true. To the contrary, I find that they were patently false.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s intentions in obtaining the list of chemicals was in contemplation for an action that he intended would be carried out to advance the cause of violent jihad. The information was sought with the intention on his part to influence by intimidation the Government of Australia and to intimidate the public.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The third and final offence relates to the offender’s possession of the Urdu document Exhibit “G”. This was found, as I have said, at his workstation on 26 October 2003. The offender, as I have already recounted, endeavoured to distance himself from this document before the jury. It is quite apparent however, that the jury did not accept his explanation. Consistently with the jury’s verdict, I do not accept his explanation and reject it. Indeed, the offender’s explanation in relation to the way in which this document came into existence and the reasons for his possession of it through until October 2003 were, as I have said, simply unbelievable.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s possession of this document reflected very clearly his intention to make use of its contents for the purpose of using the information to assist in an enterprise to assemble an explosive which would be used as part and parcel of the ultimate carrying out of an act of terror within Australia. I am satisfied that his intention or state of mind at the time it was found in his possession, and indeed prior to that time and well after, was that the material could be used to advance the cause of violent jihad in Australia. Moreover, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the offender’s intention that any such enterprise would be carried out to coerce, or influence by intimidation, the Government of Australia and to intimidate the public.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, however, that the offender had formulated any intention as at 26 October 2003 to poison any person or to cause the death of any person by the use of poison. Rather, I think the document Exhibit “G” reflected a range of options. Any one of these would have been available for the carrying out of an act of terror but, so far as the offender’s personal intentions were concerned, he favoured the use of an explosive or explosive device. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in relation to each of the three offences, the offender contemplated that the ultimate act of terror would, at least, cause serious damage to property. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, at this very preliminary stage, a definite intention had been formulated to use an explosive to kill innocent people. I am satisfied, however, that the offender would have been aware, or at least would have contemplated, that, by using an explosive to damage property or infrastructure, there would have been a risk of serious physical harm to people who might be in the vicinity; and that even death might be occasioned to persons who happened to be close to the site of the explosion. 
        
       
      
    117 The first ground of appeal is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour erred in failing to quash the indictment, because  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          i. the indictment lacked particularity; and  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ii. the indictment was duplicitous 
          
         
        
       
      
    118 Before the trial began, the appellant appealed by leave to this Court against the refusal of the trial judge to quash counts in the indictment as it then stood. The second of the grounds argued was the same as the present ground. This Court held that the indictment had not failed sufficiently to particularise the terrorist act relied on and was not duplicitous: R v Lodhi [2006] NSWCCA 121 in the judgment of Spigelman CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, at [57] – [77]. Following that appeal the matter was remitted to Whealy J in accordance with this Court’s orders. The Crown amended the indictment in order to state elements of the offences charged which were previously lacking but determined by this Court to be essential: see judgment at [78] – [94].  
     
      
    119 In the present appeal counsel for the appellant, Mr Boulten SC, acknowledged that the appellant’s intention in relying on this ground of appeal a second time was to reserve his rights in case the judgment of this Court should be reviewed. I do not think that the Court should consider this ground a second time. For the reasons already given, it has not been made good.  
     
      
    120 The second ground of appeal is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour erred in applying an unconstitutional test in determining whether information, the disclosure of which was sought by the appellant, was subject to public interest immunity.  
        
       
      
    121 I agree, for the reasons given by the Chief Justice, that s31(8) National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 (Commonwealth) does not impinge on the integrity of the judicial process.  
     
      
    122 The third and fourth and grounds of appeal may be dealt with together. They are as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour erred in refusing to exclude the entirety of the evidence relating to Willie Brigitte. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour erred in refusing to exclude evidence of the identification of Willie Brigitte and, as a consequence, the entirety of the evidence relating to Willie Brigitte.  
        
       
      
    123 The evidence of association between the appellant and Brigitte may be summarised thus -  
     
      
       
        
        Brigitte trained at a Lashkar-e-Taiba paramilitary training camp in Pakistan in late 2001. Lashkar-e-Taiba is a prescribed terrorist organisation. Brigitte’s training related not only to the local struggle for military control of Kashmir but to the wider concerns of Muslims elsewhere.  
        
       
       
        
        The appellant spent a considerable time in Pakistan in 2001, 2002 and in the early part of 2003. He knew a man there called Sajid. Sajid asked him to look after Brigitte on his forthcoming visit to Australia.  
        
       
       
        
        The appellant obtained a mobile telephone in the fictitious name Sam Praveen.  
        
       
       
        
        Shortly before leaving France on 14 May 2003 to come to Australia, Brigitte made a number of telephone calls to Sajid. On 13 and 14 May he telephoned the appellant on the Sam Praveen telephone.  
        
       
       
        
        Brigitte arrived in Australia on 16 May 2003, having travelled via New Zealand. He entered on a tourist visa. In the appellant’s notebook was an entry  
        16th Friday 8:30am NZ.  
        Then followed a flight number and the note  
        Blue trousers – yellow t-shirt – glasses.  
        The appellant met Brigitte and offered him the hospitality that Sajid had requested.  
        
       
       
        
        Brigitte remained in Australia until October 2003. He was arrested on 10 October and deported on 17 October. During that time he obtained a mobile telephone service in the fictitious name John Huck. This was done by replacing the SIM card in a mobile telephone associated with a man called Abdul Rakib Hasan. During Brigitte’s stay in Australia there were several calls between the Huck and the Praveen telephones.  
        
       
       
        
        On 3 October 2003 the appellant obtained the electricity grid maps the subject of the first count. He obtained the details of chemicals the subject of the second count on 10 October, the day after Brigitte’s arrest.  
        
       
       
        
        Hasan visited Brigitte’s flat in the company of a man who said he was an architect, that he came from Sialkot, Pakistan and that he had recently returned from that country. The Crown case was that that man was the appellant.  
        
       
       
        
        Brigitte’s premises were searched and the items found included these -  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A card, apparently stamped by a Paris retailer, bearing in handwriting the Sam Praveen telephone number, but written in the sequence appropriate for calls originating in France; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A map of Australia issued by the anti-nuclear movement; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A publication called L’Art de Guerre; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A notebook containing handwritten extracts from “The Art of War”; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          An empty magazine for a military Styer rifle; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A DVD or CD containing images of a substantial number of pages from magazines in the French language, with photographs, appearing to be articles about military weapons and assault, articles on military and intelligence and on the Australian SAS in Afghanistan. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        On 26 October 2003 the appellant, in the company of Hasan, went to an internet café and used a public telephone to call Sajid.  
        
       
      
    124 Not all the evidence I have summarised was objected to. That which was is as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        1. Yong Ki Kwon identified a photograph of Brigitte as of a man with whom he had trained every day and to whom he had spoken every day at a Lashkar-e-Taiba training course in 2001. The man had called himself Salahudin.  
        
       
       
        
        2. Rashid Altaf and Rashid Ahmad gave evidence. Mr Altaf lived at the premises in Boorea Avenue Lakemba where a man calling himself Jamal came to live. Mr Altaf identified a photograph of Brigitte as of the man Jamal. Mr Altaf’s friend, Rashid Ahmad, used to visit him there. During the first week of Jamal’s residence there, Jamal received a visit from two men. One was a Bengali whom Mr Altaf and Mr Ahmad recognised as a butcher who worked in a shop in Lakemba. They identified him by photograph as Hasan, the person previously referred to in these reasons. They did not recognise the other. He said that he was working as an architect in the city, that he came from Sialkot, Pakistan and that he had recently returned to Australia from that country.  
        
       
       
        
        3. Evidence of things found at Brigitte’s premises.  
        
       
       
        
        4. Evidence of telephone records showing that a telephone found in Brigitte’s premises was used to communicate with a telephone found in the accused’s premises.  
        
       
      
    125 It was submitted on appeal that the evidence objected to could not if accepted rationally affect, directly or indirectly, the assessment of the probability of a fact in issue: Evidence Act 1995 s55. Since the evidence failed that test it was inadmissible: s56(2).  
     
      
    126 In Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50, Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ said -  
     
      
       
        
        [6] 
          
        As is always the case with any issue about the reception of evidence, identification evidence being no exception, the first question is whether the evidence is relevant. No attention was given to this question in the arguments advanced at trial, or on appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, but that question must always be asked and answered. Further, although questions of relevance may raise nice questions of judgment, no discretion falls to be exercised. Evidence is relevant or it is not. If the evidence is not relevant, no further question arises about its admissibility. Irrelevant evidence may not be received. Only if the evidence is relevant do questions about its admissibility arise. These propositions are fundamental to the law of evidence and well settled. They reflect two axioms propounded by Thayer and adopted by Wigmore: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""None but facts having rational probative value are admissible"", 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          ""All facts having rational probative value are admissible, unless some specific rule forbids."" 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        [7] 
          
        In determining relevance, it is fundamentally important to identify what are the issues at the trial. On a criminal trial the ultimate issues will be expressed in terms of the elements of the offence with which the accused stands charged. They will, therefore, be issues about the facts which constitute those elements. Behind those ultimate issues there will often be many issues about facts relevant to facts in issue. In proceedings in which the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) applies, as it did here, the question of relevance must be answered by applying Pt3.1 of the Act and s55 in particular. Thus, the question is whether the evidence, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment by the tribunal of fact, here the jury, of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. 
        
       
      (footnotes omitted) 
       
        
       
      
    127 The Crown case at trial was that the accused had a covert and illicit relationship with Brigitte, a trained terrorist, who came to Australia in circumstances tending to demonstrate that he had done so in connection with the establishment of preparatory steps towards terrorist acts and not as a tourist. It was not the Crown case that the evidence would show that Brigitte was involved in the acts done by the appellant the basis of the charges, but that it completed a circumstantial case, enabling the jury to infer that the appellant had performed the acts charged with the requisite knowledge and intention.  
     
      
    128 Mr Boulten submitted on appeal that the question whether or not Brigitte was present in Australia in circumstances tending to suggest the preparation of terrorist acts was not a fact in issue. It may have been relevant to a fact in issue if the Crown had suggested that the appellant had conspired with Brigitte or was otherwise involved in a joint enterprise with him, but that was not the Crown case. Therefore, it was submitted, evidence relating to Brigitte was not relevant. It was submitted that taken at its highest the evidence was not capable of demonstrating that Brigitte was establishing the preparatory stages of terrorist acts. The evidence established at best that the appellant knew Brigitte and that Brigitte had trained in a terrorist camp. The question to be answered was therefore whether the fact that the appellant knew a trained terrorist could rationally affect the assessment of the probability that his actions were connected with a terrorist act or, in relation to count two, that his actions were done in preparation for a terrorist act. The answer, it was submitted, was that it could not. It was merely evidence of association between the two men.  
     
      
    129 Mr Boulten relied on a series of cases dealing with evidence of the accused’s association with offenders as proof of guilt: United States v Polasek 162 F.3d 878 at 884 (5th Cir. 1998); United States v Lopez-Medina 461 F.3d 724 at 741-42 (6th Cir. 2006); United States v Romo 669 F.2d 285 at 288-89 (5th Cir. 1982); R v Ejiofor [2002] OJ No. 891; Bounds v The Queen [2006] HCA 39 in the judgment of Kirby J at [84] and R v Fung [2002] NSWCCA 479. The facts of those cases are of no particular assistance and need not be repeated here. The United States and Canadian cases were concerned with the wrongful admission of evidence that associates of the relevant accused had been convicted on other occasions on charges of the kind that the accused was then facing. The principle which they establish is that the law does not permit proof of guilt of an accused person merely by proving that the accused associated with other guilty persons. Something more is needed. But there is no law that prevents the Crown from proving all the circumstances in which an act in question was done in order to show that in doing it the accused had a particular state of mind. Those circumstances may include the accused’s contemporary association with a person who, whether complicit or not, may be thought to be familiar or concerned with or to have an interest in fostering acts having the character of those charged. If the evidence of association tends to explain why the accused acted as he did, it is probative.  
     
      
    130 It may be accepted, as his Honour recognised, that the evidence could not establish that Brigitte was involved in the acts the appellant was charged with having committed. But I do not consider that the available effect of the evidence was limited in the manner described by Mr Boulten. In giving judgment his Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        For present purposes, the facts in issue extend to and include the mental ingredients of the charges against the accused, described in the Criminal Code Act as fault elements: for example, the physical acts of the accused must have been deliberate; they must have been connected with the preparation for a terrorist act; and the accused must have known, that is have been aware, of the connection. In relation to count 2, the Crown alleges that the accused “intentionally” did an act in preparation for a terrorist act and this state of mind must be proved as well. All the fault elements involved in each charge must be proved beyond reasonable doubt.  
         
         
        The material sought to adduced by the Crown (including the body of evidence identified by Mr Boulten SC and which forms the subject of the present application) is, in my view, all material, which, if it were accepted, could rationally effect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fault elements I have identified. 
        
       
      
    131 It seems to me that his Honour’s conclusion was correct. The evidence objected to was more than mere evidence of association. The knowledge and intent of the appellant in collecting documents or seeking information or possessing the document specified in the fourth count was to be judged from all the surrounding circumstances. Those circumstances included that he was at all material times in frequent and secret communication with a terrorist trained in Pakistan. The appellant had spent a considerable time in that country. They had a mutual connection there. That terrorist had entered Australia pretending to be a tourist, but using a false name and a telephone service in a false name. By the use of these false names he kept his communications with the appellant secret. Like Brigitte, the appellant used a false name when using his mobile telephone. His intention was to conceal his communications with the trained terrorist. The acts of the appellant relied on by the Crown were committed close to the time of Brigitte’s arrest. It seems to me that the evidence was capable of establishing that the appellant had a secret relationship with Brigitte during the time immediately before he committed the acts on which the charges were based. Proof of the relationship explained why he engaged in a series of acts none of which was on its face necessarily one of criminal intent.  
     
      
    132 The alternative submission was that his Honour ought to have excluded the evidence because its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant: Evidence Act 1995 s137. Mr Boulten submitted that in assessing the probative value of the evidence his Honour was obliged to conclude that at best it demonstrated that the appellant knew Brigitte, who had trained with a terrorist organisation almost two years earlier. If their relationship was covert that would not make it more likely, without proof of joint criminal activity, that the appellant was engaged in terrorist activity. There was no evidence that Brigitte was engaged in terrorist activity in Australia. So the probative value of the evidence was no more than minimal.  
     
      
    133 I do not accept that his Honour was bound to regard the probative value of the evidence as minimal. It seems to me that it derived substantial probative force from its capacity to reveal that what the appellant was doing was not a series of innocent acts.  
     
      
    134 On appeal, two sources of unfair prejudice were identified. The first, which was not raised at trial, was that so great was the body of evidence about Brigitte and so prominent was the place that it took at the trial that the jury were likely to overvalue it and become distracted from the true issues. Of the twenty-eight witnesses called in the Crown case, fourteen gave evidence about Brigitte and twelve of them gave evidence only about the Brigitte connection. Those witnesses were called first. Correspondingly large proportions of counsel’s addresses and the summing-up were devoted to the evidence of those witnesses. When the appellant gave evidence, thirty-eight of the one hundred and forty-three pages of the transcript of his evidence recorded questions about Brigitte.  
     
      
    135 The first witness called was Kwon, who gave evidence by videolink from the United States of America. His evidence took a day. In order to prove that Brigitte had had the relevant training, it was necessary to prove how Kwon had been trained. That evidence, it was submitted, would impermissibly connect the appellant with terrorist training when it was never the Crown case that he had been so trained.  
     
      
    136 It was submitted that the true issues were even more obfuscated by the Crown’s evidence about Sajid, which did not explain who he was or how he was related to the issues in the case, what he was doing and whether he had anything to do with Lashkar-e-Taiba.  
     
      
    137 Unfair prejudice was said to flow from the evidence of the lie the appellant told when giving the false name Sam Praveen in order to get his hands on the mobile telephone. There was reference to well known cases dealing with the risk of a miscarriage of justice when lies are resorted to to corroborate other evidence. It was submitted that there was no connection between the mobile telephone and the offences.  
     
      
    138 It was submitted that the Crown “ensured that the spectre of Brigitte was omnipresent throughout the trial” and that it was “inconceivable that the jury did anything other than give significant attention and subsequently (sic) weight to the evidence relating to Brigitte, even though the relationship between Brigitte and the appellant was, even at its very best, a side issue”. Reference was made to R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [252] and Scott v R [1989] AC 1242 per Lord Griffiths at [1256].  
     
      
    139 It seems to me that proof that the appellant did the acts on which the charges were based, resulting wholly or mainly from direct evidence, was always going to be achieved quickly and with a modest amount of evidence. So far as the surviving counts are concerned, it might have been expected that the Crown would have little difficulty in establishing that the appellant collected the maps of the electricity grid, sought information from Deltrex and possessed the document written in Urdu. So it turned out. The appellant admitted the collection, seeking the information and possessing the document. The substantially contested issues in the case were always going to be concerned with the appellant’s knowledge and intention in doing those things. In that respect it was a circumstantial case and the Crown was obliged and, I think, entitled to point to every available relevant circumstance. In this respect it was necessarily an extensive case.  
     
      
    140 Before his Honour could properly have rejected the evidence under s137, it had to appear that there was a real risk of unfair prejudice, either because the jury would place undue emphasis on the evidence or use it in some irrational manner: Festa v The Queen (2001) 208 CLR 593 per McHugh JA at 609; R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; R v Yates; R v Lisoff [1999] NSWCCA 364; R v Serratore [1999] NSWCCA 377.  
     
      
    141 I do not think that if his Honour had been asked to consider these matters he could properly have concluded that there was a real risk that the jury would place too much emphasis on the evidence about Brigitte or that they would misuse it because they misunderstood it. No complaint is made about his Honour’s directions about how the Crown relied on the evidence. There was no assertion that Brigitte was involved in terrorist activities in Australia. The only relevant part played by Sajid was as an agency of communication between the appellant and Brigitte, a fact that the jury could not have failed to understand. The appellant’s lies were proved only to show his intention to conceal his actions and divert suspicion from himself, and in particular to conceal his communications with Brigitte. Although the body of evidence pointed to was large, it was in a practical sense the only evidence that went to the only contested issues, all of which required consideration one way or another of the appellant’s state of mind.  
     
      
    142 In my opinion the criticism of the sheer size of the body of circumstantial evidence is unjustified, as is the suggestion that some risk of unfair prejudice flowed from the amount of evidence adduced or from the order in which witnesses were called. There is no cause for any suggestion that the Crown conducted its case in a manner intended or calculated to attract unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    143 There is a second argument about unfair prejudice which, unlike the first, was dealt with at trial. Unfair prejudice is said to have resulted from publicity about Brigitte in the news media and the Parliament prior to the appellant’s trial. The trial began on 19 April 2006, two and one-half years after Brigitte’s arrest and deportation. The appellant tendered at trial a document collating and summarising no fewer than one thousand five hundred and seventy-one published references to Brigitte. They included newspaper articles published in Sydney and in interstate capital and regional cities as well as radio news broadcasts, including national broadcasts on the Australian Broadcasting Commission networks. The first publication was made on 27 October 2003 and the last on 14 January 2006. Some one thousand two hundred and forty of them happened within a year of Brigitte’s arrest and deportation and the remainder were spread over the next one and one-half years. The same material was tendered on appeal. It is impossible to deal with much of the detail, but it may be said that Brigitte was reported to have been suspected of wishing to blow up the Lucas Heights atomic reactor and the Rugby World Cup final. There were articles about uranium mines and places where nuclear ships had docked. There was what has been described as a list of completely speculative propositions, including an assertion that Brigitte was said to have been involved in attempts to kill some unidentified Taliban leader. Prominent were repeated references to the belief that Brigitte was planning to blow something up. The Crown was not asserting any such things about Brigitte, of course, and the submission at trial and in this Court was that the material would have affected the minds of jurors and was of such a sensational nature as to divert them from their task of judging the issues on the evidence put before them at trial.  
     
      
    144 His Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        The arguments advanced by Mr Boulten SC on the s 137 point focussed on a very considerable body of media material collected by the defence team to demonstrate the excessive publicity generated by the presence of Willie Brigitte in Australia. It is essentially because of this material that Mr Boulten suggested the jury will “over estimate” and “over value” any evidence that mentions the name Willie Brigitte. The Crown responded to this argument by suggesting that any possible danger of misuse by the jury of the subject body of evidence could be adequately eradicated by appropriate directions from the court. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I turn now to consider the second argument raised by Mr Boulten SC. I have endeavoured to read the very significant body of material collected from media releases for the purposes of the argument. I also take into account that this is by no means the only media attention that would have been made in relation to Willie Brigitte at the time of his arrest and into the period of 2004 when the accused was himself arrested. I agree with Mr Boulten that many of the statements made in the press are simply examples of sensationalism that have no possible warrant in fact. Mr Boulten’s main argument is that the members of the jury may have seen some at least of this material and may recollect it so that any mention of Willie Brigitte will carry with it the possibility that whatever evidence is adduced at this trial will be misused I am unable to accept this submission. 
        
       
       
        
        First, it is now nearly two and a half years since Willie Brigitte was arrested and deported from Australia. While general impressions may remain in the minds of some members of the public, I am confident that detail will have been forgotten. Secondly, it is two years since the accused himself was arrested and, while there have been references to Willie Brigitte since that time in the media, there is no reason to suppose that the accused himself received the treatment that Brigitte did in the press. Thirdly, I agree with the Crown’s submissions that an appropriate direction to the jury will bring home to them a self evident matter, namely that they are to confine their attention to evidence about Brigitte that is presented in this trial. There may be other matters that ought be included in such a direction and I will, no doubt, be assisted in that regard by suggestions from both the Crown and the defence at the appropriate time. 
         
        
       
      
    145 The directions foreshadowed by his Honour were given in due course. His Honour said this during the summing-up -  
     
      
       
        
        It is important that you approach this task dispassionately, judging the facts of this case without emotion and confining yourself to the evidentiary material. It is always the duty of judges of fact to approach their task dispassionately and without emotion. You must carry out your task in this trial disassociating yourselves completely from the emotional response of other people in the community. You are the judges of the fact, others are not.  
        
       
       
        
        It is also very important to free your mind of prejudice and preconceptions. Everyone had prejudice, everyone has preconceptions. That should be recognised. Prejudice and preconception is no more than an attitude, a starting point from which we all make our judgments. In ordinary life, we make out judgments from starting points of that sort all the time; day in, day out. But this is not ordinary life. Here you are the judges. Judges of fact must free their minds from preconceived ideas and prejudices and must try the case according to law and according to evidence. Judges are expected to be impartial and independent, to be free from all outside influence. You must not fear, for example, any media criticism of what might occur in this trial. You must not bring about a verdict because you feel sorry for the accused or because you have any manner of racial prejudice or any other type of prejudice, including religious prejudice. Those types of considerations must be put aside altogether. They must be put aside completely.  
        
       
       
        
        Clearly, the question of terrorism and similar acts around the world has attracted high emotions, and people have strong views about the topic. But once again, I point out to you that you must leave those considerations aside and you must decide this case purely and solely upon the evidence which had unfolded before you.  
        
       
       
        
        The fact that you may have heard about terrorist acts elsewhere in the world, and indeed close to our country for that matter, and that the topic appears in the media on a regular basis, is something about which you need to take particular care. Those topics and that reporting might perhaps invite you to consider matters which are foreign to your task. You must resist that. For example, a number of years ago there was considerable publicity in the media about Willy Brigitte. You may have seen it at the time. If you did and you have any recollection of it, please put it out of your minds entirely for the purposes of this trial. I simply repeat that you should not bring to this trial and to your considerations of this case anything which involves feelings of prejudice, whether they be racial, religious, ideological or otherwise, or for that matter any form of emotional sympathy. Such matters would only distract you from your essential task. As judges you must rise above these kinds of considerations and at all times act dispassionately and impartially.  
        
       
      
    146 It was submitted that his Honour had not appreciated that the evidence showed that Brigitte had been a topic of discussion not simply at the time of his arrest and deportation but “continued to be so throughout (sic) the appellant’s trial”. Of course, his Honour was considering the objection at the beginning of the trial.

    148 It was submitted that publicity about Brigitte was not confined to the commercial and national news media, but that the record of debates in the Commonwealth Parliament contained serious assertions about Brigitte’s role and intentions. None was put before his Honour, however, and it seems doubtful whether such publicity could significantly add to what was demonstrated as a long and substantial course of publicity in the national news media, which would be far more likely than Hansard to bring itself to the attention of jurors.  
     
      
    149 It was submitted that his Honour’s observation that the appellant had not been treated as Brigitte had did not justify the decision to admit the evidence, and the implication was that his Honour had misunderstood the issue he was required to judge.  
     
      
    150 Finally, it was submitted that his Honour ought not have come to the view that the problem could be solved by giving the jury a firm direction, since no direction that could have been given was capable of removing the risk of unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    151 I do not think that his Honour misunderstood the nature of the inquiry he was required to make. His Honour’s references to the law were appropriate and his summary of the test correct. His Honour’s observation about the relative positions of Brigitte and the appellant put into context the inquiry at hand.  
     
      
    152 The risk to which the appellant was pointing – that the jury might overvalue the evidence about Brigitte – was not one that could be precisely described or evaluated. It had to be assessed, insofar as it could be assessed, in the context of a criminal trial in which the appellant, not Brigitte, was being accused of some very serious offences.  
     
      
    153 In my opinion his Honour was correct in concluding that any risk of unfair prejudice would be removed by firm directions. His Honour was entitled to expect that the jury would follow those directions. In The Queen v Glennon (1992) 173 CLR 592, Mason CJ and Toohey J said at 603 -  
     
      
       
        
        The possibility that a juror might acquire irrelevant and prejudicial information is inherent in a criminal trial. The law acknowledges the existence of that possibility but proceeds on the footing that the jury, acting in conformity with the instructions given to them by the trial judge, will render a true verdict in accordance with the evidence. As Toohey J observed in Hinch, in the past too little weight may have been given to the capacity of jurors to assess critically what they see and hear and their ability to reach their decisions by reference to the evidence before them. In Murphy v R 
        ,  
        we stated: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          But it is misleading to think that, because a juror has heard something of the circumstances giving rise to the trial, the accused has lost the opportunity of an indifferent jury. The matter was put this way by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 
            
          R v Hubbert 
          : 
           
            
           
          ‘'In this era of rapid dissemination of news by the various media, it would be naive to think that in the case of a crime involving considerable notoriety, it would be possible to select 12 jurors who had not heard anything about the case. Prior information about a case, and even the holding of a tentative opinion about it, does not make partial a juror sworn to render a true verdict according to the evidence.” 
           
          
         
        To conclude otherwise is to underrate the integrity of the system of trial by jury and the effect on the jury of the instructions given by the trial judge.  
         
        (footnotes omitted) 
         
        
       
      
    154 In my opinion his Honour’s assessment was open and his remarks disclose no error.  
     
      
       
      The identification of Brigitte 
       
      
    155 There was abundant evidence that the appellant had associated with Brigitte. There was unchallengeable evidence that a man calling himself Salahudin had undergone terrorist training in Pakistan. The link between those bodies of evidence was Kwon’s identification of Brigitte’s photograph as of Salahudin. Kwon purported to identify such a photograph on two occasions and the Crown tendered evidence of them both. It was submitted at trial that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice: Evidence Act s137. It was also submitted, relying on s138 of the Act, that the evidence had been obtained improperly or in contravention of an Australian law or in consequence thereof, and the desirability of admitting it did not outweigh the undesirability of admitting evidence obtained in the way it had been obtained. His Honour held that the evidence had not been obtained improperly or in contravention of any Australian law and that its probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant.  
     
      
    156 Kwon was a citizen of the United States of America who, in 2001 at the suggestion of his teachers, travelled to Pakistan in the hope of gaining entry to a Lashkar-e-Taiba training camp. Eventually he arrived at a camp called Camp Masada and entered training there. There were to be three phases of training. The first and the first part of the second would be held at that camp. The second part of the second phase would be held at a different camp at higher altitude. Kwon completed the first phase and entered the second. A few days into that phase, a man called Salahudin arrived and joined the group as a trainee. There were at that stage about seven trainees. They did all their training together. They were accommodated in the same place. They slept in the same dormitory, ate together and prayed together. They had discussions together. Kwon, Salahudin and the others completed the first part of the second phase and moved to the higher camp. The course there lasted for between twenty and twenty-five days. As before, everything was done together and all the participants lived closely together. Kwon had a lot of individual conversations with Salahudin, who told him something of his background in France and his history as a teacher. Neither went on to the third phase of the program but both travelled in company to a town called Muridke, where they waited some weeks for further instructions. From there they went in different directions and Kwon has not seen Salahudin since those days.  
     
      
    157 Kwon spent some time in South Korea, where FBI agents got in touch with him. Eventually he was returned to the Unites States of America and faced, first, passport violation charges and then much more serious charges, alleging that he had conspired to provide support to al-Qaeda and the Taliban for the purpose of fighting against United States troops in Afghanistan and an intention to take up arms against his own country’s troops. At least one of the charges attracted a maximum sentence of imprisonment for life. He was also charged with a number of firearms offences. He entered a plea bargain with United States prosecutors with a number of results and consequences. The resulting sentence was imprisonment for eleven and one-half years, but with the prospect of bringing what was called a Rule 35 motion to reduce his sentence. The bones of the arrangement appear to be these. In acknowledgment of the sentence I have mentioned Kwon was to give assistance to the United States investigating authorities, and that required him to do a number of things, including giving evidence in prosecutions in the United States and elsewhere. If he did give truthful evidence as promised, and if he otherwise fulfilled the terms of the arrangement, he would have the opportunity to come back before the sentencing judge under the arrangement I have mentioned and ask for a reduction in sentence. The plan was put into action. Kwon gave evidence in a number of matters, two prosecutions in the United States and one in the United Kingdom. He was taken back before the sentencing judge under Rule 35 and his sentence was reduced. By the time he came to give evidence in the appellant’s case he had already reached the end of the custodial portion of his reduced sentence and was serving a period of three years on probation.  
     
      
    158 On 26 November 2003, while he was still serving the custodial part of his sentence, Kwon found himself in a gaol in Alexandria, Virginia. On 26 November 2003 he was taken to the nearby police station and placed in an interview room. There he received a visit from two FBI agents, Mr Mamula and Mr Ammerman. His Honour heard evidence from Kwon, Mamula, Ammerman and an ASIO officer who was referred to as AO1. His Honour’s findings may be summarised thus.  
     
      
    159 On 5 November 2003 the ASIO officer gave an officer of the FBI a photograph of Brigitte, as part of a briefing to try to find out what the FBI knew about Lashkar-e-Taiba or Brigitte. At that time ASIO suspected that Brigitte had been involved with Lashkar-e-Taiba. On 20 November 2003 an ASIO agent gave an FBI agent a photograph of Brigitte, a photograph of the accused and one photograph of another person. The photographs were handed over with the intention of gaining access to Kwon and another man in order to interview them. The ASIO officer told his correspondent that he would if possible ask Kwon and the other man if he could identify anybody in the photographs. He took the photographs to the meeting in the interests of accurate intelligence and not to preserve any subsequent police activity. He did not tell the FBI agent not to show the photographs to anybody before ASIO came to the interview. On 26 November 2003 Ammerman was in the interview room with Kwon and his solicitor before anyone from ASIO spoke to him. He showed Kwon four photographs, one of Brigitte, two of the appellant and one of the appellant’s brother. Kwon recognised the person in the first photograph as the man Salahudin, someone he knew from his attendance at the training camp. Agent Ammerman left the interview room and met the ASIO officer. He brought him back to the interview room and an interview took place. The ASIO officer showed Kwon a folder containing twelve photographs, some described as passport-type and others of people taken in public places. Some were in colour and some in black and white. Each photograph showed one man. One of the colour photographs was of Brigitte. There were two photographs of the appellant. He showed Kwon the photographs one at a time and invited him to say whether he could recognise any of the people shown in them. The only person Kwon recognised was the person he named as Salahudin. As he did so, Kwon told the ASIO officer that that was the French person he had told him about.  
     
      
    160 There existed at the time a document called Legal Handbook for Special Agents, issued to FBI agents, which contained guidelines about the procedures that should be adopted when showing photographs of suspects to witnesses. His Honour accepted the evidence of agents Mamula and Ammerman to the effect that when they showed the photographs to Kwon they were not investigating the possible involvement of a person in a crime. That, his Honour was satisfied, was a precondition to the application of the guidelines. His Honour was satisfied, on the evidence of Agent Ammerman, that what they were doing was more in the context of assistance to a friendly foreign nation. His Honour was satisfied that the American agency was making Kwon available to ASIO so that it could ask him whether he could identify any person he had trained with in 2001 in Pakistan. Although the approach was unusual, showing photographs to Kwon before the arrival of the ASIO officer, his Honour accepted that what Ammerman was doing was essentially assisting the Australian government in an intelligence gathering operation. Although the information obtained might have been of some interest to the FBI itself, that was not the purpose of the operation. As the agents were not investigating the possible involvement of any persons in the photograph in a crime, the guidelines did not apply. The opinion of either of the agents whether they did apply (one thought they did, the other not) was irrelevant. 
     
      
    161 Mr Boulten submitted to his Honour that if the evidence was not obtained in contravention of FBI guidelines or of any Australian law, it was improperly obtained, so s138 applied. No authority could be cited supporting that application. His Honour held that there was no impropriety. His Honour referred to the judgments of Adams J in Director of Public Prosecutions v Coe [2003] NSWSC 363 and of Howie J in Regina v Richard Bruce Cornwell, 20 February 2003, unreported.  
     
      
    162 Having found that there was no impropriety and no illegality, his Honour, for more abundant caution, went on to make the kinds of findings s138 would have required. He considered the probative value of the evidence reasonably high and the evidence important to the Crown case, being the only evidence that directly placed Brigitte in a Lashkar-e-Taiba training camp. The offences charged were very serious and carried significant penalties. If the procedures adopted breached FBI guidelines or were otherwise improper, the breaches or improprieties were not deliberate or reckless, but done as part of the process of sharing intelligence with a friendly foreign country. Nothing happened in either the first interview with the FBI agents or with the subsequent interview with the ASIO officer that suggested to Kwon that he should or was bound to identify any particular person to be shown to him. The actions of Agent Ammerman were not designed to be unfair. On the contrary, his Honour considered his procedure appropriate.  
     
      
    163 His Honour went on to consider whether the evidence should be excluded under s137. The Evidence Act 1995 has nothing to say about evidence of identification of any person other than a defendant. Mr Boulten relied on the Common Law position as set forth in a passage of the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Alexander v The Queen (1979-1980) 145 CLR 395 at 400, dealing with unfairness in the process of identification of an accused person by photograph shown by the police. His Honour observed, however, that there were important distinctions to be made. First, Gibbs CJ was, strictly speaking, dealing with identification, not recognition, evidence, that is evidence about a person not previously known to the witness. Secondly, his Honour was dealing with the identification of a person accused of a crime, rather than, as in the present case, with the recognition of a third party. Thirdly, his Honour did not deny the need to weigh and compare probative value and the risk of unfair prejudice.  
     
      
    164 Whealy J proceeded to make that comparison. His Honour rehearsed the long period of time, somewhere between three and four weeks, during which Kwon and Salahudin had been in each other’s presence, training together, sleeping in the same dormitory, participating in daily religious sessions, and the like. After their training was over, they travelled together to Lahore and then to the place where they waited. They travelled in the same vehicle and stayed in the same premises. They stayed there for about three weeks. They spoke to one another during travel and during their stay as they waited. His Honour observed that this was no idle acquaintanceship but one in which a reasonably strong bond would have been forged. There was the nature of the training itself, including its ideological and religious basis, which would have cemented the relationship. His Honour considered it significant that Kwon had immediately identified, that is, recognised, the photograph of the man he knew as Salahudin. 
     
      
    165 His Honour acknowledged the attack Mr Boulten had made upon Kwon’s credibility. He had demonstrated that in cross-examination Kwon had not always told the whole truth when giving evidence. His Honour considered that such matters could not lead to the exclusion of the evidence but were for the jury to consider. His Honour noted that there was no indication to Kwon that he had to identify the photograph of Brigitte. His Honour rejected a submission that there was any significance in the fact that the FBI agents had not made notes of the conference proceedings. His Honour rejected the submission that the proceedings in which the ASIO officer showed Kwon twelve photographs was “a complete sham”.  
     
      
    166 His Honour concluded that evidence of both identifications was relevant and of “quite high probative value”. His Honour did not consider that the unusual features he had identified affected the value of the evidence of recognition by Kwon of Salahudin so as to reduce its probative value significantly. His Honour considered that there was no likelihood that the jury might misuse the evidence, given suitable directions. His Honour expressed himself satisfied that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant.  
     
      
    167 In this Court Mr Boulten pointed to some of the requirements of ss3ZO and 3ZP Crimes Act 1914 (Commonwealth), which prescribe procedures that police constables must follow. If constables show photographs to a witness to obtain evidence of identification of a suspect they must show photographs of at least nine different persons. Each photograph not of the suspect must be of a person who resembles the suspect in age and general appearance and lacks features markedly different from those described by the witness before looking at the photographs. The photographs must not appear to be of persons in police custody. Police constables should not suggest to a witness that a particular photograph is of the suspect. The witness must be told that there may be no photograph of the suspect among those being shown. Constables must keep records identifying each photograph shown to the witness.  
     
      
    168 Mr Boulten pointed also to the FBI guidelines, which provide that except where it is impracticable a suspect’s photograph shown should be in a group of at least five other photographs. There should be a reasonable attempt in using photographs of persons other than the suspect to see that they resemble the suspect. The prints of the several photographs should not be dissimilar. Photographs should not indicate that persons shown in them are guilty of criminal misconduct. If “mug shots” are the only photographs available, number boards should be masked.  
     
      
    169 Of course, none of these requirements applied to the procedure in which Kwon identified a photograph of the man Salahudin in the presence of the ASIO agent. He was not a constable. The person he was trying to identify was not a suspect. The FBI guidelines did not apply either because, as his Honour concluded, the agents were not trying to identify a suspect. They were not conducting a criminal investigation at all, but assisting a friendly foreign nation. Even so, Mr Boulten called these provisions in aid as indicating the sorts of measures that should be employed to ensure that any important identification by photograph is carried out in a way that avoids the difficulties inherent in such a process, so as to tend to produce a reliable result. Ultimately the submission was that the probative value of the evidence of identification of the photograph of Brigitte was unreliable because of the circumstances in which it had been made, first in the presence of the two FBI agents and then in the presence of them and the ASIO agent.  
     
      
    170 Mr Boulten cited a number of United States cases on the guidelines and drew attention to the small number of photographs shown by the FBI agents – four photographs of three people. Mr Boulten referred to R v Dwyer [1925] 2 KB 799 and to the need for caution where the evidence is that only one photograph was shown. It was submitted that his Honour failed to consider the difficulties inherent in the procedures employed by the FBI agents, which were apt to produce unreliable results because Kwon, who was prepared to tell lies when it suited him, was placed in a position in which he was likely to tell a lie. He was obliged to give assistance to the FBI. The consequences of not doing so would be grave. Kwon was likely to believe that at least one of the three men shown in the photographs was a suspect and that the agents wanted the assistance of evidence against that man. He was therefore likely to say what he thought the agents might like to hear.  
     
      
    171 In deciding whether to include the evidence, his Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Boulten SC relied in particular on a passage in the judgment of Gibbs CJ in  
        Alexander’s 
         case (1981) 145 CLR 395 at 400. I have set this out in my earlier judgment and there is no need to repeat it here. But, in my view, there are a number of important distinctions to be made. First, Gibbs CJ was, strictly speaking, dealing with identification rather than recognition of a person known to the witness. Secondly, he was dealing with the identification of a person accused of committing a crime rather than, as here, with the recognition of a third party. Thirdly, Gibbs CJ did not deny the existence of and the need to exercise a weighing exercise of probative value on the one hand, and the risk of unfair prejudice on the other. This exercise requires an evaluation of the circumstances.  
        
       
       
        
        In those circumstances, I turn to consider issues related to the probative value of both “identifications” and considerations as to the risk of unfair prejudice to the accused in the trial. Although the question of the probative value of evidence is generally a matter for the jury, the present exercise requires the Court to determine whether the probative value of the evidence is or is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
        
       
       
        
        At the outset, it is important, indeed critical, to note that there was a relatively extensive relationship between the man Kwon and Salahudin. Kwon said he first met Salahudin when the latter joined the early stages of phase 2 training at the LeT camp (T 965 line 35 and following). Salahudin remained in the group for the balance of the training period. This would indicate that the two men trained together for a period of somewhere between three and four weeks. During that period, Kwon trained with Salahudin every day (T 965 lines 50-55); he spoke to him on a daily basis (T 966 line 8) and slept in the same dormitory each night (T 965 line 57). In addition, Mr Kwon said he observed Salahudin participating in daily religious sessions (T 966 line 20 and following). 
        
       
       
        
        When their training was completed, the group (including Kwon and Salahudin) left the training camp. They travelled back to the LeT office in Lahore and then went on to Muridke. During the course of these travels, Kwon travelled in the same vehicle as Salahudin and stayed in the same premises in Muridke (T 967 line 45). They stayed at these premises for a period of approximately three weeks. They conserved in the course of travelling and during their stay at Muridke. 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that it is inescapable to conclude other than that Kwon and Salahudin were in close to proximity to one another for a reasonable extensive period of time and in circumstances where Kwon was likely to have become quite familiar with Salahudibn both as to his appearance and general characteristics. This was no idle acquaintanceship but one in which a reasonably strong bond would have been forged between the two men. The very nature of the training itself, including its ideological and religious basis, would have cemented the relationship.  
        
       
       
        
        The second matter that I consider of significance is that Kwon identified Salahudin immediately he was shown the four photographs by the FBI Agents. Similarly, when he was shown 12 photographs by the ASIO officer, he had not the slightest difficulty in making the recognition of the man he had met at the training camp. He recognised him “immediately” (T971 line 25). By contract, he did not recognise any of the others.  
        
       
       
        
        I am conscious of the fact that Mr Boulten SC has made a significant attack upon the credibility and reliability of the witness Kwon. He described these features as “worrying”. The particular matters stressed were -  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) The witness was not always truthful. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The witness was often quite deceptive and admittedly so.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) Overtime, he had provided “incremental admissions” to the FBI. He “bluffed it out” for a period of time by denying things and inventing situations, which were to his knowledge untrue. He would only admit a fact if he thought that FBI knew about it. This manner of providing information continued will into his relationship with the FBI.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) The witness was shown photos by the FBI from time to time. He was prepared to do what the FBI told him to do, including telling lies in the phone in an endeavour to “trap” his co-defendants. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) The witness had at all times up to and including late 2003 a powerful motive to tell the FBI what they wanted to hear – this connotes “an extraordinary degree of suggestibility” to tell the FBI what they want to hear.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Mr Boulten SC connects these assertions, a number of which are undoubtedly correct, to make a forceful submission that the identification of Salahudin in the photos shown by the FBI agents was of no value whatsoever. Showing one photo to Kwon was very suggestive of the result the agents wanted to receive especially where the relationship between the witness and the FBI was of “a special kind”. In other words, Mr Boulten submitted that the witness was “unduly responsive to signals”.  
        
       
       
        
        My view is that, while these matters are obviously of great significance in relation to the issue of credibility and reliability of the witness, they ought not and cannot lead to the exclusion of the evidence. I have examined this aspect of the matter in my previous decision and I remain of the view that merely because a witness appears to be lacking in credibility or unreliable, even to a large extent, is no basis for the trial judge to exclude the evidence. Issues such as the credibility and reliability of a witness are, subject to appropriate directions being given, matters entirely for the jury. For this reason essentially, I am unable to accept Mr Boulten’s submissions on this point. 
          
        
       
      
      
     
      
    172 On appeal, Mr Boulten attacked his Honour’s conclusion that the question whether Kwon was to be believed was one exclusively for the jury and incapable to leading to the rejection of the evidence.  
     
      
    173 In my opinion the attack fails. The submissions at trial and in this Court attempted to run together, as though they could potentiate one another in the mind of the trial judge, two disparate criticisms of the evidence. The first related to the risk that an honest witness who identifies someone may be mistaken. It is in recognition of that risk that the courts urge caution in assessing identification evidence. That has nothing to do with the second criticism, namely the risk that a witness may deliberately lie because of some perceived obligation to assist the authorities. 
     
      
    174 The manner in which photographs are put before an honest witness is important because of the need to prevent honest mistakes. So guidelines and, sometimes, statutes deal with the quality and quantity of photographs to be shown and the circumstances in which they are shown. So there is a general requirement that witnesses be told not to make assumptions about the photographs. So a process may properly be criticised, as it was here, by reference to the small number of photographs shown and to the fact that Kwon was not told that they might not include anyone he might recognise. The process was capable of criticism, too, because no attempt appears to be made to have Kwon record a description of Salahudin before he was shown any photograph. But it was not open to extend that legitimate criticism by eliding questions about Kwon’s credibility. The attempt to do so was made in the face of the Court’s judgment in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112, a fact Mr Boulten acknowledged. In that case Spigelman CJ reviewed the pre-Evidence Act and post-Evidence Act cases on the question whether assessment of the probative value of evidence required consideration of its reliability. His Honour concluded that the test for rationality was concerned with what it was open for the Tribunal of fact to conclude, not with what it was likely to conclude: judgment at [48] – [68]. The other members of the Court agreed.  
     
      
    175 Mr Boulten made two submissions about R v Shamouil. First, it was submitted that this was one of the exceptional cases spoken of in which it was simply not open to the jury to give weight to the evidence: see the judgment of Spigelman CJ at [56], referring to the judgment of Simpson J in R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 at [43].  
     
      
    176 In my opinion this is not a case in which his Honour was bound to weigh the credit of Kwon, much less to conclude that it was incapable of belief. The questions of the credit of Kwon and the dangers associated with identification by photograph were not “inextricably entwined”, to use Simpson J’s words. His Honour would have usurped the jury’s function if he had assessed the credibility of Kwon.  
     
      
    177 Mr Boulten’s alternative submission was that this Court should not follow R v Shamouil because it was wrong. No authority was put before the Court that was not considered in Shamouil itself. In my respectful opinion the judgment was right. This Court should follow it.  
     
      
    178 In assessing the probative value of the evidence his Honour said this -  
     
      
       
        
        The evidence of Mr Kwon in relation to his recognition of the man Salahudin both to the FBI agents and to the ASIO officer appear to me to possess a high degree of probative value. This is because of the relationship between the two men and the fact that the witness purported to recognise a person he had trained with over a reasonably substantial period of time. I do not accept that the matters that transpired between Agent Ammerman and Kwon in the pre-interview indicate that any suggestion was made to Kwon that he had to identify the photo of Willie Brigitte. While it is true that no record was kept of what was said at this meeting either by Ammerman or by Kwon, I consider that I am entitled to infer that he was simply asked whether he recognised any of the people in the four photos he was shown. While it is true also that Kwon himself has no recollection of having seen these photographs, he readily accepted that he may well have seen them. Moreover, his recall of recognising Salahudin’s photograph when it was shown to him by the ASIO officer is at least consistent with the earlier recognition, even though he does not recall it.  
        
       
       
        
        In this context, I do not accept Mr Boulten’s further submission that what happened in the interview room when the ASIO officer produced the 12 photographs was “a complete sham”. Since the earlier process during the pre-interview required the witness to recognise a person he knew reasonably well, the subsequent recognition falls into the same category. I accept that it was hardly a surprising result and this may be pointed out to the jury in relation to any directions that need to be given. It is of course possible that Kwon was mistaken when he recognised the person in the photo as Salahudin. It is possible there was some degree of displacement although I do not consider the evidence placed this possibility particularly high. If one acts on the assumption that Kwon was acting truthfully and in accordance with his own memory then the sting in the submission is much less. On the other hand, if the jury were to take the view that the witness is not truthful and that he was acting at the suggestion of the FBI agents, they would give little weight to his purported of recognition. Appropriate directions, in my view, will enable the jury to neither over estimate the identification nor under estimate the matters, which Mr Boulten says, weaken the probative of the evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        It must be stressed that recognition of a person known to a witness does not fall into an absolute category. The extent of the relationship and the depth of the knowledge of a person will vary from one relationship to another. In that context, I accept that the directions may be given to a jury, which, in an appropriate case, will highlight to the jury that there are dangers even where the situation is one of recognition rather than identification of a stranger. (See  
        R v Bentley 
         (1991) Crim LR 620 per Lord Lane CJ at 621). But the distinction between recognition and identification is one that has a particular relevance in the factual situation arising in the present matter.  
        
       
       
        
        I consider that the evidence of both identifications plainly is relevant and of quite high probative value. Notwithstanding the unusual features that have been revealed by the evidence, I do not think that these affect the value of the evidence of recognition by Kwon of Salahudin so as to reduce significantly that probative value. Whether the jury accept the evidence and regard it as either credible or reliable is another matter and not one upon which I can or should base an order for exclusion. The evidence is plainly closely connected with one of the principal issues in the proceedings although it is not the only evidence upon which the Crown relies. It can properly be taken into account in the context of the evidence as a whole ( 
        R v Tugaga 
         (1994) 74 A Crim R 190 at 196). Moreover, I do not think that there is any likelihood of the jury misusing the evidence and, subject to suitable directions, any risk that the jury might over value the identification or under estimate the capacity for mistake can be effectively dealt with. I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.  
        
       
       
      
    179 Mr Boulten submitted that his Honour erred in attributing significant probative value to the evidence. He began with a concession that this was evidence of recognition rather than of identification. Nonetheless, it was submitted, his Honour overemphasised the importance of the “purported interaction” between Kwon and Brigitte, was “overly influenced” by the decisiveness of Kwon’s identification and relied on the fact that Kwon did not recognise any other person whose photograph he was shown. Finally, no description of Salahudin was recorded before Kwon was shown the photographs. 
     
      
    180 I do not think that it can be concluded that his Honour overemphasised the importance of the circumstances in which Kwon had come to know Salahudin. They were remarkable and crucial to the process of identification. Really, the submission that his Honour overemphasised these matters would be available only by inference from a conclusion that the identification was mistaken.  
     
      
    181 The second submission related to this portion of his Honour’s judgment -  
     
      
       
        
        The second matter that I consider of significance is that Kwon identified Salahudin immediately he was shown the four photographs by the FBI Agents. Similarly, when he was shown 12 photographs by the ASIO officer, he had not the slightest difficulty in making the recognition of the man he had met at the training camp. He recognised him “immediately” (T971 line 25). By contract, he did not recognise any of the others.  
        
       
      
    182 It seems to me that his Honour was entitled to have regard to the immediacy of Kwon’s recognition of Salahudin in considering the fairness or otherwise of the process that was under attack.  
     
      
    183 The third submission related to the last sentence of the paragraph I have extracted. It seems to me that his Honour was not relying upon Kwon’s identification of Brigitte but on the fact that he could not identify anyone else. It was legitimate for his Honour to do so in assessing the submission that the process was flawed and that Kwon was likely to say anything he thought the agents might like to hear.  
     
      
    184 It is correct to say that unfairness resulting from the risks of identification evidence can be reduced if witnesses are required, before being shown any photograph, to describe a person they have in mind. It is not altogether clear that such a thing could have been done in the present case, but plainly it did not happen. The fact was not lost on his Honour, however, and it was not determinative in the assessment of probative value.  
     
      
    185 It seems to me that his Honour correctly concluded that the evidence was relevant. His Honour was entitled to conclude that the probative value of the evidence was “quite high”, and that there was no likelihood that the jury would misuse it. His Honour was correct in concluding that suitable directions could be given to the jury to enable them to understand the risks inherent in identification by photograph.  
     
      
    186 These grounds of appeal have not been made good.  
     
      
    187 The fifth ground of appeal is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        A miscarriage of justice resulted from the absence at trial of fresh evidence concerning the identification of Brigitte 
        
       
      
    188 After the conclusion of the appellant’s trial Kwon was giving evidence on 14 March 2007 in committal proceedings in the Local Court at Penrith. The defendant was a man called Hasan. There were these questions and answers -  
     
      
       
        
        Q Is there some reason why the French guy sticks in your mind more than Abu Asad – do you see what I am getting at there?  
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. Because I remember I think when the – one of the FBI agents – well, there’s always two, actually. I think they questioned me shortly before or shortly after the [redacted] guy came, and they even told me, like, the French guy’s real name, which I didn’t know until that, at that point, and that, you know, that he wasn’t – he was in some big trouble in France and his case was pretty big. So I remember Salahudin clearly, but as far as Abu Asad, I don’t recall… 
        
       
      
    189 It was submitted that the evidence was fresh, because it was unavailable at trial. So much may be accepted.  
     
      
    190 Kwon said at trial that he could not recall the identification procedure. Agents Ammerman and Mamula both said that they did not speak to Kwon about Brigitte, though the context of their answers was the introduction to the identification procedure; nobody at trial had any interest in asking either of the agents what he might have said to Kwon after he had identified Brigitte’s photograph.  
     
      
    191 It was submitted that if evidence had been available there would have been two consequences at the trial. First, the evidence would have undermined that of Kwon, Ammerman and Mamula and their credibility. Secondly, the information imparted to Kwon would have exacerbated the displacement effect, making all subsequent procedures worthless. It was submitted that if the jury had had the fresh evidence they “would in all likelihood have rejected Kwon’s uncorroborated evidence that Brigitte trained” with Lashkar-e-Taiba. Without that evidence there was no evidence capable of establishing that the association between Brigitte and the appellant was anything but innocent, and the appellant had consequently been deprived of a real chance of acquittal.  
     
      
    192 It is known that the FBI agents spoke to Kwon before they showed him photographs and between that event and the showing of photographs by the ASIO agent. It seems fair to suppose that they spoke to him afterwards as well, and if they did they may well have said something about Brigitte. It is therefore far from clear that in his answer in the Local Court Kwon was speaking about something that happened before or after either or both of the acts of identification. Mr Boulten’s response to this observation was to say that if the evidence had been available at trial it could have been explored in cross-examination of Kwon, Ammerman and Mamula. As it turned out, the chance was lost, and so was a chance of acquittal.  
     
      
    193 There is no doubt that if this material had been available at trial counsel would have been able to use it to cross-examine Kwon, Ammerman and Mamula. However, there is considerable doubt whether it could have been thereby established that anything was said at a time when it could have affected the process of identification. On its face, the evidence is not inconsistent with anything that Kwon, Ammerman or Mamula said at trial.  
     
      
    194 When dealing with a ground of appeal based on fresh evidence, the Court is concerned to decide whether the absence of the evidence from the trial has occasioned a miscarriage of justice. That question has to be answered in the context of all the evidence given at trial. In Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259, Toohey and Gaudron said this at 301 -  
     
      
       
        
        There is no very precise formulation of the quality which must attach to fresh evidence before it will ground a successful appeal. It has been said that it must be ""credible"", ""cogent"", ""relevant"", ""plausible"": see, for example, Gallagher, at pp 395-396, 401-402, 408-409; Craig v. The King (1933) 49 CLR 429, at p 439; Ratten, at pp 519-520; Lawless, at pp 671, 676-677. In essence, the fresh evidence must be such that, when viewed in combination with the evidence given at trial, it can be said that the jury would have been likely to entertain a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused if all the evidence had been before it (Gallagher, per Brennan J. at p 410) or, if there be a practical difference, that there is ""a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the (accused)"" (Gallagher, per Gibbs C.J. at p 399 and per Mason and Deane JJ. at p 402). 
        
       
      (footnotes omitted) 
       
      
    195 In my opinion the evidence fails to pass the test for cogency. All that was lost was a chance to cross-examine and thereby possibly introduce evidence which might have proved relevant and might have borne on the integrity of the identification process. In my opinion the Court should not receive the evidence. I would reject this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    196 The sixth ground of appeal is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour erred in refusing the appellant’s application for directed verdicts at the conclusion of the Crown case.  
        
       
      
    197 At the close of the Crown case the appellant applied for an order directing a verdict of not guilty on all four counts. His Honour refused the application.  
     
      
    198 The first count was laid under s101.5 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code, which provides -  
     
      
       
        
        101.5 Collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts

    203 The point in the application was this. By the terms of the Code and the manner in which the counts were pleaded in the indictment, the collection of documents referred to in the first count had to be connected with preparation for a terrorist act, the seeking of information referred to in the second count had to be done in preparation for a terrorist act and the possession of the thing referred to in the fourth count had to be connected with preparation for a terrorist act. It was submitted that it was necessary for the Crown to prove that someone, whether or not that person was the appellant, had the intention relevant to each event at the time of the event. The submissions were summarised in this way in a judgment delivered by his Honour on 17 May 2006 -  
     
      
       
        
        The following ultimate submissions were made: -  
         
          
           
          (a) In respect of counts 1, 3 and 4, the Crown is unable to prove that the acts allegedly committed by the accused were connected with preparation for a terrorist act; 
           
           
          (b) In relation to count 2, the Crown has failed to prove that the act allegedly committed by the accused was in preparation for a terrorist act; and 
           
           
          (c) In respect of counts 1 and 3, the Crown has failed to establish mens rea concurrent with the actus reus. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The starting point of the accused’s submissions in relation to grounds (a) and (b) is the Crown’s continued position in the trial that the accused by the end of October 2003 had not yet finally decided on the precise nature of any terrorist attack; nor had he been perhaps close to determining finally a precise target or targets; nor precisely had he determined who was to carry out the attack or attacks or precisely when or precisely how.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The simple point made on behalf of the accused is this: in a prosecution for the present offences where it is not alleged that it was the accused himself who was to carry out the ultimate terrorist acts, it is necessary for the Crown to adduce evidence of the motivation of the person who was in fact to carry out those attacks. Without such evidence, the Crown cannot succeed on counts 1, 2 3, and 4. Accordingly a directed verdict should be entered.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The third argument, that set out in (c) above, proceeds on the basis that, in relation to counts 1 and 3, the Crown case is that the accused was the person who sought to carry out the terrorist act himself. This assumption is made because, otherwise, according to the defence argument, these two counts would otherwise fail in any event for the reasons particularised unde (a) and (b).  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The third argument is this: the Crown must demonstrate that the accused knew that the documents in question were connected with preparation for the terrorist acts particularised. The Crown, however, has been unable to prove that the accused had formed the intention to prepare an action in respect of those specific particularised targets. Since the Crown’s evidence at best establishes future, conditional intention and not an intention concurrent with the acts alleged, counts 1 and 3 cannot be made out. 
        
       
      
    204 In giving judgment, his Honour referred to this passage of his own judgment delivered on 14 February 2006, dealing with the terms of the indictment -  
     
      
       
        
        The general framework of Part 5.3 of Ch 5 of the Code supports the conclusion I have reached in the following way: the type of action that is made criminal in terms of the division ranges from actually engaging in a terrorist act (s 101.1) down to an act that is altogether preliminary to that engagement: for example, receiving training connected with preparation for a terrorist act (s 101.2(1) and (2)); possessing a thing connected with preparation for the engagement of a person in, or assistance, in a terrorist act (s 101.4(1) and (2)); possessing a thing connected with preparation for the engagements of a person in, or assistance in, a terrorist act (s 101.4(1) and (2)); collecting or making a document connected with the preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in, a terrorist act (s 101.5(1) and (2)); and doing an act in preparation for or planning a terrorist act (s 101.6).  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The wide range of activities made significantly criminal is itself postulated on the possibility that the criminal offence will or may occur long before any terrorist act itself is carried out. Indeed, apart from the offence of engaging in a terrorist act, each of ss 101.2, 101.4, 101.5 and 101.6 makes it clear that the offence is committed even if “the terrorist act does not occur”. (As I have already concluded, this is a reference to the phrase “a terrorist act” where relevantly appearing in relation to each section creating the offence).

      JUDGMENT  
      (On issues concerning provision of written directions and chronology to jury) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: After closing addresses of counsel were completed on 20 November 2007, I heard submissions from counsel concerning the content of written directions and a chronology to be provided to the jury as part of my summing up.  
     
      
    2 Draft written directions (MFI135) were provided by me to counsel together with a draft chronology (MFI134). The draft written directions were based, to an extent, upon written directions provided by Sully J to the jury at the 2005 trial, although amended and expanded in a number of significant respects. Aspects of Sully J’s written directions had been the subject of argument by counsel and decision by me at the pre-trial stage (R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788) and at the conclusion of the Crown case (R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 30) [2007] NSWSC 1119). In particular, these judgments had considered appropriate directions of law on the elements of the first count, a charge of defrauding the Commonwealth under s.29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
     
      
    3 The draft chronology was settled by me after receipt of draft chronologies from counsel for the Crown (MFI125) and the Accused (MFI128), provided at my request. No chronology had been provided to the jury in the 2005 trial, given a dispute between the parties about the proposed content of any chronology. 
     
      
    4 Counsel were provided with an opportunity to consider the draft written directions and draft chronology on 21 November 2007 (T4789-4791) and I heard submissions from counsel on those issues on 22 November 2007 (T4795-4872). Mr Sutherland SC, for the Accused, relied upon written submissions (MFI136 and MFI137) and made oral submissions as well concerning the proposed written directions. The Crown made oral submissions on these matters. I indicated my decision with respect to contested issues on 23 November 2007 (T4873-4876) when the parties were provided with the written directions in the form which I proposed to give to the jury (MFI138). I received written submissions from the parties concerning contested matters in the chronology (MFI139 and MFI140) and, having considered those submissions, I provided to the parties on 23 November 2007 the chronology in the form to be provided to the jury (MFI141).  
     
      
    5 On 23 November 2007, I indicated that I would give my reasons at a later time with respect to issues bearing upon the written directions and the chronology (T4873). This judgment contains those reasons. 
     
      
    6 On 26 November 2007, folders containing documents, including the written directions and chronology, were provided to each member of the jury at the commencement of the summing up (MFI142). 
     
      
      Written Directions to Jury 
       
       
      Element of Causation in the First Count (page 13, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    7 Mr Sutherland SC submitted that the jury ought be instructed on the element of causation in the first count in accordance with the doctrine of innocent agency. Written and oral submissions were made for the Accused in support of that application (MFI136; T4795-4804; T4807-4808). Those submissions referred to a number of decisions including Royall v The Queen (1991) 172 CLR 378, R v Franklin (2001) 3 VR 9 and Pinkstone v The Queen (2004) 219 CLR 444. 
     
      
    8 I should place this application in context.  
     
      
    9 In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) (a pre-trial application by the Accused, inter alia, to quash or permanently stay the first count on the indictment), I referred at [178] to an argument by then counsel for the Accused (Mr Clelland SC and Mr Livermore) on the element of causation which relied, in part, on the doctrine of innocent agency: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted for the Accused that this direction  
        [by Sully J at the 2005 trial]  
        was erroneous in that a direction was not given in terms of  
        Royall v The Queen 
         (1991) 172 CLR 378 at 411 that the actions of the Accused must amount to ‘a substantial or significant cause’ of the issue of favourable rulings and opinions. The Accused submitted, further, that directions should have been given with respect to the concept of innocent agency in accordance with  
        R v Franklin 
         (2001) 3 VR 9 and  
        Pinkstone v The Queen 
         (2004) 219 CLR 444 given that the rulings and opinions were not issued by the Accused himself, but by other ATO officers.” 
        
       
      
    10 Having considered those submissions, I expressed the following conclusions at [206]-[208] concerning the Accused’s contention that the first count was foredoomed to fail with respect to the element of causation: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I have considered, as part of my independent assessment, the transcript and exhibits from the first trial to which my attention was drawn in the course of submissions. In addition, I have considered carefully the judgment of Sully J of 27 June 2005 in which his Honour found a prima facie case on causation. The evidence relied upon by the Crown at the first trial supports a prima facie case on this element. In forming this view, I have kept in mind the concept of ‘substantial or significant cause’ referred to in  
        Royall v The Queen 
        . Although Sully J did not use this precise phrase in directions to the jury, I consider that the directions which were given involved the same concept. 
         
         
        I am not satisfied that the concept of innocent agency has application to this case. The wording of the first count is significant in this respect. It is not alleged that the Accused himself issued the rulings or opinions. It is alleged that he caused them to be issued. Even if the concept of innocent agency did have application to this case, however, I am satisfied that the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes and the other evidence at the first trial identified by Sully J which bears upon the issue of causation supported a prima facie case in this respect. 
         
         
        In circumstances where I am satisfied, based on the evidence adduced at the first trial, that a prima facie case exists on this element, I am not satisfied that the first count is foredoomed to fail by reference to this element. I reject the application of the Accused based on this contention.” 
        
       
      
    11 The Court of Criminal Appeal refused leave to appeal from my decision rejecting the applications by the Accused to quash or stay the first count in the indictment: Petroulias v R [2006] NSWCCA 415. The High Court of Australia refused an application by the Accused for special leave to appeal from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: Petroulias v The Queen [2007] HCATrans 92.  
     
      
    12 At the conclusion of the Crown case, Mr Sutherland SC sought a verdict by direction with respect to the first count upon a number of bases, including the element of causation. In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 30) at [9]-[16], I considered and rejected the Accused’s argument concerning the element of causation. No submission based upon the doctrine of innocent agency was advanced by the Accused in support of that application.  
     
      
    13 During his closing address to the jury, Mr Sutherland SC referred to the concept of an innocent agent with respect to the element of causation in the first count (T4139-4140). In the absence of the jury, I raised with Mr Sutherland SC his reference to the doctrine of innocent agency and reminded him of my pre-trial ruling on that issue (T4286-4288). As part of that discussion, Mr Sutherland SC informed me that he would apply, in due course, for a direction to be given to the jury by reference to the doctrine of innocent agency. The issue was raised by Mr Sutherland SC, after closing addresses, by way of application for directions of law to be given to the jury.  
     
      
    14 Mr Sutherland SC submitted that the legal concept of innocent agency or innocent instrument had application to this case. He submitted that the Crown argument that Mr Aivaliotes was a “puppet” of the Accused, and that the Accused exercised a measure of control in this respect, attracted the application of this principle. He submitted that the jury ought be directed in accordance with paragraph 68 of the defence written submissions (MFI136). 
     
      
    15 The Crown opposed the defence application that the jury be instructed by reference to the doctrine of innocent agency (T4804-4807). The Crown submitted that the issue had been argued and determined by me in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) and that the Accused had unsuccessfully appealed from that judgment to the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court of Australia. The Crown submitted that the directions on the element of causation given by Sully J at the 2005 trial remained appropriate, but accepted that the direction should include the phrase “substantial or significant cause” (T4806.6).  
     
      
    16 The Crown submitted that the doctrine of innocent agency had no application to this case. The Crown case on the first count alleges a course of conduct by the Accused over a period of time involving documentary and verbal contact between the Accused and each of Messrs Chow, Targett, Charles and Aivaliotes.  
     
      
    17 I have considered the written and oral submissions of the Accused with respect to the doctrine of innocent agency and have examined the authorities and text relied upon in this regard. Having done so, I remain of the view expressed in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) that the doctrine of innocent agency does not have application to this case. I accept the submissions of the Crown on this issue.  
     
      
    18 As I observed in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) at [207], the wording of the first count in the indictment is significant. It is not alleged that the Accused himself issued the rulings or opinions. Rather, it is alleged that he caused them to be issued. It is the Crown case that the Accused, as part of a course of conduct, caused the relevant opinions and rulings to issue. The Crown submits that the evidence reveals conduct on the part of the Accused, both subtle and unsubtle, which caused Messrs Chow, Charles, Targett and (particularly) Mr Aivaliotes to issue the 75 advance opinions and private rulings (Exhibit C95) which are the subject of the first count. The Crown case, on the element of causation, relies upon ongoing contact, in documentary and verbal form, between the Accused and each of these officers. The Crown contends that this contact, as part of a course of conduct, establishes that the Accused caused these rulings and opinions to issue.  
     
      
    19 I remain unpersuaded that the doctrine of innocent agency has application to this case. This conclusion is reinforced by an examination of the proposed direction at paragraph 68 of the defence written submissions (MFI136), which I do not consider ought be given to the jury. 
     
      
    20 It was for these reasons that I declined to direct the jury with respect to the doctrine of innocent agency on the element of causation in the first count. 
     
      
      Element of Dishonest Means in the First Count (pages 14 and 15, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    21 The draft written directions contained an additional direction on the element of dishonest means in the first count to that given by Sully J at the 2005 trial. Mr Sutherland SC made written and oral submissions concerning the proposed direction (MFI137, page 14; T4827-4828). He did not oppose the additional direction, but sought some additions to it. The Crown agreed, in general terms, with the additional direction proposed by Mr Sutherland SC (T4848-4850).  
     
      
    22 The directions concerning the element of dishonest means captured the essence of what had been proposed by Mr Sutherland SC and the Crown during submissions (T4874). 
     
      
       
      Course of Conduct in the First Count (page 11, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    23 The draft written directions furnished to counsel (MFI135) included directions that the Crown case on the first count involved an alleged course of conduct on the part of the Accused between about 1 September 1997 and 27 February 1999 which was said to form part of the same transaction or criminal enterprise, involving an ongoing and systematic defrauding of the Commonwealth. The draft written directions included further directions with respect to a case based upon a course of conduct.  
     
      
    24 As I explained to counsel at the time of distribution of the draft written directions (T4790), I included a direction to this effect given the reference in closing addresses, including the closing address of Mr Sutherland SC, to the Crown case on the first count alleging a course of conduct on the part of the Accused. I had regard also to my conclusions in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) at [325]-[334] where a submission was rejected the first count was bad for duplicity. In reaching this conclusion, I relied upon the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Moussad (1999) 152 FLR 373 where the concept of a single criminal enterprise was applied by the Court with respect to a count alleging fraud under s.29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
    25 Mr Sutherland SC opposed a written and oral direction to the jury with respect to course of conduct in the first count (pages 12-13, MFI137; T4825-4827). The Crown requested that such a direction be included in the written directions (T4847-4848). 
     
      
    26 In circumstances where both counsel acknowledged that the Crown case on the first count was based upon a course of conduct by the Accused, it seemed to me that the jury were entitled to practical assistance on the legal concepts relevant to such a count in the written directions. There could be no good reason, in my view, why a direction of that type would be given to the jury orally rather than in writing, particularly given the complexities otherwise affecting the first count.  
     
      
    27 Accordingly, the written directions to the jury included directions concerning the concept of course of conduct with respect to the first count.  
     
      
       
      The Element of Deprivation in the First Count (pages 15-19, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    28 The draft written directions included directions concerning the element of deprivation in the first count which followed, in broad terms, the directions given by Sully J to the jury at the 2005 trial. In addition, I included draft directions which flowed from conclusions reached in my judgment on the application for a verdict by direction on the first count: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 30) at [75]-[102]. 
     
      
    29 Mr Sutherland SC sought directions in accordance with the submissions advanced by him, and rejected by me at the close of the Crown case on the element of deprivation (MFI137, pages 14-15; T4828-4834, T4859-4865). The Crown submitted that the draft written directions ought be given subject to some modifications (T4850-4855).  
     
      
    30 Consistent with my earlier rulings in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) and R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 30), I determined that the directions on deprivation ought accord largely with the draft written directions. 
     
      
    31 In the light of oral submissions of counsel, I made further modifications to the written directions, which I explained briefly on 23 November 2007 (T4874-4875). 
     
      
       
      The Evidence of Mr Morgan (page 5, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    32 Mr Sutherland SC sought that I incorporate in the written directions to the jury a number of propositions which appeared in the written directions given by Sully J to the jury in the 2005 trial together with some additional matters (MFI137, pages 2-6; T4811-4816). His Honour had directed the jury, in effect, that acceptance of the evidence of Mr Morgan was essential if the Crown was to prove that the Accused was a party to a commercial arrangement for the marketing of opinions and rulings (which were the subject of the first and second counts) for financial benefit to the Accused. Mr Sutherland SC submitted that a direction to this effect should be given. 
     
      
    33 The Crown opposed the directions sought by the Accused and submitted that directions in accordance with the draft written directions ought be given (T4837-4838). The Crown had submitted to the jury that a combination of inferences available from the Crown’s substantial documentary case and statements made by the Accused in documents provided by him to Mr Aivaliotes on 16 March 1999 (Exhibit C147) and to Mr Panos prior to 8 April 1999 (Exhibit D42) and in intercepted telephone conversations in September and October 1999 (Exhibits C196, C197, C198, C230, C231, C232, C233), together with statements made by him to Federal Agent Wildman during a conversation on 24 March 2000 (Exhibit C199) provided a foundation for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was party to such a commercial arrangement, for financial benefit, without reliance upon the evidence of Mr Morgan. The Crown submitted that it was a question of fact for the jury to determine whether it was satisfied that the Accused was party to such an arrangement, and that the Court should not direct the jury that such a finding could only be made if the evidence of Mr Morgan was accepted.  
     
      
    34 I gave careful consideration to the appropriate characterisation of Mr Morgan’s evidence as the trial progressed. I was conscious of the approach taken by Sully J at the 2005 trial on this aspect. Nevertheless, and with respect, I took a different view to Sully J and accepted the Crown submission that the jury should not be instructed on this aspect in the manner adopted by Sully J at the 2005 trial.  
     
      
    35 I accepted that a body of evidence was available, apart from Mr Morgan, which left it open to the jury to be satisfied that the Accused was party to such a commercial arrangement for financial gain. It was, of course, a question of fact for the jury to determine whether it was so satisfied, to the criminal standard, by reference to this evidence, whether considered alone or in conjunction with the evidence of Mr Morgan. Given that I took a different view to Sully J on this issue, I should explain my reasoning by reference to the evidence. Without seeking to be exhaustive, evidence upon which my opinion was based included the following. 
     
      
    36 Firstly, documents are in evidence which were retrieved from the hard drive of a computer located in a Melbourne storage facility which the jury could infer were created by the Accused in September-October 1997 for marketing purposes, including documents entitled “Boosting Productivity” and “Productivity Incentive Trust Plan” (Exhibit C206, Tabs 16, 17, 18, 19). 
     
      
    37 Secondly, a letter was located on the hard drive of the same computer which the jury may view in the following way. The jury may conclude that the Accused created the letter addressed to Mr John McLaren on 24 October 1997. In the letter, the Accused proposed to Mr McLaren that he contact an accountant, Mr Norman Draper (a Crown witness), whom the Accused had met on 14 October 1997 at a seminar at which the Accused spoke in his ATO capacity. The jury may conclude that the Accused wished Mr McLaren to contact Mr Draper to promote the sale of a scheme by reference to the opinion issued by Mr Chow on 8 October 1997 (Exhibit C95, Tab 1) with the Accused saying in the letter, “We are the only ones with an advance opinion which includes a Part IVA sign off” and later “It is important to point out that price should not be a consideration for a scheme that will work for next 10 years so as to reduce tax - particularly when it carries no audit risk. If the cheaper end of the market sell theirs at $5,000 less than us for example, that is a small price to pay over a substantial period for avoiding audit risk” (Exhibit C206, Tab 23). 
     
      
    38 Thirdly, the unchallenged evidence of Mr Calligeros, accountant, was that the Accused and Mr Morgan attended his office on 11 November 1997 for the purpose of promoting for sale employee benefit trust schemes. 
     
      
    39 Fourthly, a letter was located on the personal computer issued to the Accused by the ATO after he resigned and returned the computer on 8 April 1999. The letter, described in the trial as the “Nick to Nick” letter (Exhibit D42), was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nick, 
        
       
       
        
        The DPP has now become involved. They are looking at favouritism towards certain people. There are a number of loose ends that need to be sorted out. 
        
       
       
        
        These are:- 
        
       
       
        
        Geoff and his mates. As you know, they have been giving us the problems in what they have been saying. It is important that you sort out the position with Geoff. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the meeting in January - the 2 day one where you, me, Geoff and Emmanuel met in the York Street offices to discuss how PIC would operate its plans and that PIC would be sending in a number of plans. It is important that you and Geoff get familiar with those notes. These are notes prepared by either Geoff or you and sent to me. (They are very suspicious of those notes). 
        
       
       
        
        The client lists - if Geoff has any, make sure they are destroyed. 
        
       
       
        
        McLaren: I believe they now know about Global Growth. What is the relationship with PIC? I don’t know, I am going to say that they are some sort of copycat as Geoff and Mclaren swap ideas and letters. But I would not know the full story. That is for you to sort out. 
        
       
       
        
        There is a problem with the Ashley Cain application. It is dated 25 March (as are all PIC applications - eg Co Ltd by Guarantee and ETP Plan). Further, answers questions that have not yet arisen until October. Ie the Deed of Contribution is in response to the Commissioner’s ruling in October - they can’t have predicted it back in March. 
        
       
       
        
        The only answer I can suggest and please make sure that McLaren has memorised, is that because when they called in October, and I raised the FBT concerns, the  
        [sic]  
        amended the application but not the original date. Ie they changed their submission on the FBT point, without changing the date of the original application and faxed it a few times to the ATO to make sure that they got it. 
        
       
       
        
        Money - This is particularly important. Everything must be accounted for, even if as loans to Geoff and others. No HK shit. It smells bad. The idea of investing in HK was to set up a major superfund as a spin off from the existing operations.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown submitted that the jury should conclude that this letter was written by the Accused to Mr Nick Panos after the investigation had commenced, with the Accused directing that persons involved in the arrangement (including Mr Panos, Mr Geoff Strong and Mr John McLaren) take action (including destruction of documents) and give accounts to investigators as suggested by the Accused. The Crown submitted that the letter demonstrates that the Accused was a controlling figure in the arrangement and that the clear inference was that the Accused was so involved for financial gain. In this respect, the Crown pointed, in particular, to the last paragraph of the letter where the Accused gave certain directions about money.  
       
      
    40 Fifthly, a telephone intercept conversation between the Accused and Mr McLaren on 24 September 1999 is in evidence (Exhibit C198). The conversation includes the following exchange between the Accused (“N”) and Mr McLaren (“J”) about what to say to AFP investigators:  
     
      
       
        
        “J And what I wanted to talk to you about ah was sort of what I I mean I mean they're sort of ah taking my advice but do we need to drop in PRODUCTIVITY INCENTIVE CORPORATION I think it's I think that's the way to go isn't it? 
         
         
        N No why? 
         
          
         
        J Well just that it then directs it back to ah the people in Sydney rather than me personally doesn't it? 
         
         
        N Um no because the problem is JEFF said that he'd only done the ten and he's only done the ten so then they will come to you anyway because . . ah they'll come to you and they'll say well hold on JEFF said he's done ten so I think what they're trying to do is piece the picture in pee piece the picture together … 
         
         
        J That's right so if they come to me I'd say … 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J Look I was licensed under by PRODUCTIVITY INCENTIVE CORPORATION um ah RICHARD MORGAN um … 
         
         
        N No don't mention RICHARD MORGAN. 
         
         
        J You don't … 
         
         
        N Because he's oh he's disappeared. 
         
         
        J He has has he … 
         
         
        N Well I haven't I haven't heard a word from him. 
         
         
        J No I haven't either okay so well where did I come up with all this information because the ruling requests exactly the same as ah …  
         
         
        N Oh you got it on. 
         
         
        J … 
         
         
        N You got it on disc from PANOS. 
         
          
         
        J From PANOS okay so PANOS. 
         
         
        N Yeah. 
         
         
        J PANOS is well that's all right so long as I got that that contact that they know about. 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J Then there isn't a problem. 
         
         
        N Mm. 
         
         
        J And then basically if they ask me who I've sold to then it's pretty well all the ones that have got the rulings isn't it? 
         
         
        N Exactly. 
         
         
        J So then that ties in that completes that loop? 
         
         
        N Yep. 
         
         
        J Um and that's about it isn't it? 
         
         
        N Yeah.” 
         
         
        
       
      The Crown submitted that the direction by the Accused to Mr McLaren in the conversation that no mention should be made of Mr Morgan supported a conclusion that a sinister or corrupt commercial relationship existed between the Accused and Mr Morgan which the Accused did not wish to come to the attention of investigators. 
       
      
    41 Evidence of the type referred to at [36]-[40] above, in my view, is available to the jury to support a conclusion that the Accused was, at all relevant times between September 1997 and February 1999, party to a commercial arrangement, for personal financial gain, arising from the sale of Productivity Incentive Trust Plans and other schemes, which were the subject of advance opinions and private rulings (Exhibit C95) issued by the ATO. 
     
      
    42 I note that there is evidence in which the Accused denies receiving money, including a telephone intercept conversation between the Accused and Mr Strong on 2 October 1999 (Exhibit C230) and the interview between Federal Agent Wildman and the Accused on 24 March 2000 (Exhibit C199). The Crown submitted that these denials should be assessed by the jury in light of Mr Morgan’s evidence that money paid to the Accused had been returned to Mr Morgan and, in about September 1999, the Accused met Mr Morgan at the Coogee Bay Hotel and, in the course of a conversation about money which Mr Morgan had gambled away, the Accused is alleged to have said, “It is probably the best thing that could have happened because at least I have not received any benefit from what we did” (T583.14). All of this, of course, was for the jury to consider as the judges of the facts in the trial. 
     
      
    43 It is the case that the evidence of Mr Morgan is the only direct evidence from a witness that the Accused agreed to receive money, and did receive money, as part of such an arrangement. It is the case that Mr Morgan has given different accounts, since March 2000, as to whether money had been paid to the Accused and concerning the identity of the person who returned such money to Mr Morgan.  
     
      
    44 I formed the view, however, that it was a matter for the jury to consider the competing submissions of the Crown and the Accused concerning the assessment of all evidence touching upon this question as part of the jury’s fact-finding function. It was not for me, and would have been erroneous, to direct the jury that acceptance of Mr Morgan’s evidence was a prerequisite to a finding adverse to the Accused on the existence of an arrangement to which the Accused was party for financial gain.  
     
      
    45 Accordingly, I did not accept the submissions of Mr Sutherland SC that the written directions to the jury should follow the directions given by Sully J at the 2005 trial. Rather, the written directions pointed to Mr Morgan being an important witness in the trial and foreshadowed the requirement for a warning (under s.165(1)(d) and (2) Evidence Act 1995) with respect to his evidence.  
     
      
    46 It was for these reasons that I declined the application for the Accused for additional directions with respect to the evidence of Mr Morgan. 
     
      
       
      The Evidence of Mr Aivaliotes (page 6, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    47 The draft written directions provided to counsel also included proposed directions concerning the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes in this trial. A significant difference between the 2005 trial before Sully J and the present trial was that the Crown was granted leave on a number of topics to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes under s.38 Evidence Act 1995 on the basis that his evidence was unfavourable to the Crown: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005. I formed the view that it was appropriate to touch upon this aspect of the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes in the written directions to be provided to the jury. 
     
      
    48 Mr Sutherland SC sought a number of modifications to the proposed directions (MFI137, pages 6-7). The Crown supported inclusion of this direction in the written directions (T4846).  
     
      
    49 I determined that the directions should accord with the draft with one modification (T4873). 
     
      
       
      Failure by the Crown to Call Certain Witnesses (pages 5 and 6, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    50 Mr Sutherland SC applied that I give a direction to the jury in terms of Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 with respect to the Crown’s failure to call a number of persons as witnesses, in particular, Messrs Panos, Strong, McLaren and Gray (MFI137, page 7). The Crown opposed the giving of such a direction (T4842). Sully J had declined to give such a direction at the 2005 trial.  
     
      
    51 In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1), I considered an argument as part of a permanent stay application by the Accused, that the failure of the Crown to call competent and compellable witnesses, including Messrs Panos and Strong, constituted a basis for a stay. At [287]-[302], I considered and rejected this submission. In doing so, I referred to the judgment of Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Dyers v The Queen (2002) 210 CLR 285 at 291 [6], where their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, as a general rule, a trial judge should not direct the jury in a criminal trial that the prosecution would be expected to have called persons to give evidence other than those it did call as witnesses. It follows that, as a general rule, the judge should not direct the jury that they are entitled to infer that the evidence of those who were not called would not have assisted the prosecution. A direction not to speculate about what the person might have said should be given. Again, exceptions to these general rules will be rare and will arise only in cases where it is shown that the prosecution's failure to call the person in question was in breach of the prosecution's duty to call all material witnesses.” 
         
        
       
      The Crown relied upon this statement in opposing the direction sought by the Accused. 
       
      
    52 Having considered the submissions advanced on behalf of the Accused in this trial, I was not satisfied that the direction sought by Mr Sutherland SC should be given. In this respect, I applied Dyers v The Queen at 291 [6]. I was not satisfied that the failure of the Crown to call witnesses, including Messrs Panos, Strong, McLaren and Gray, involved a breach of the prosecution’s duty to call all material witnesses. The written directions on this aspect were similar to those given by Sully J at the 2005 trial. 
     
      
       
      Directions Concerning the Accused Not Giving Evidence (page 7, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    53 Mr Sutherland SC sought that I repeat, in terms, the written directions of Sully J at the 2005 trial with respect to the Accused not giving evidence in the trial (MFI137, pages 7-8; T4816-4819). The Crown submitted that certain directions given by Sully J ought not be repeated and that the proposed direction in MFI135 ought be given (T4842-4843). 
     
      
    54 I accepted the submission of the Crown on this aspect. The proposed written directions reflected those contained in the Criminal Trial Bench Book of the Judicial Commission of New South Wales on this topic. I was satisfied that the draft written directions on this issue were appropriate in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
       
      Consciousness of Guilt (pages 7 and 8, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    55 The draft written directions provided to counsel, in their original form, included directions on consciousness of guilt along the lines given by Sully J to the jury at the 2005 trial. My draft directions also included reference to particular exhibits relied upon by the Crown in this respect. 
     
      
    56 Mr Sutherland SC opposed inclusion in the direction of any reference to particular exhibits upon which the Crown relied with respect to consciousness of guilt (MFI137, pages 8-10; T4819-4822). The Crown submitted that such references were appropriate to assist the jury to understand the areas of evidence to which this direction of law applied (T4838-4839).  
     
      
    57 I was satisfied that these references were appropriate, in the context of a lengthy and complex trial, to assist the jury to identify particular areas of evidence to which the direction on consciousness of guilt needed to be applied. 
     
      
    58 The Crown submitted that a more elaborate direction on consciousness of guilt ought be included in the written directions, reflecting the principles referred to by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Quinlan v The Queen (2006) 164 A Crim R 106 at 116 [15]. Mr Sutherland SC did not oppose the direction proposed by the Crown by reference to Quinlan v The Queen.  
     
      
    59 I incorporated the direction proposed by the Crown in the written directions provided to the jury (T4873-4874). 
     
      
       
      Admissions (pages 8 and 9, Written Directions 
      ) 
       
      
    60 The draft written directions (MFI135) included a direction concerning evidence which the Crown relied upon as evidence of admissions by the Accused. In R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 7) [2007] NSWSC 16, I had admitted several telephone intercept conversations involving the Accused upon the basis that they were admissible as admissions by the Accused. It was for this reason, in particular, that I included a direction on admissions in the draft written directions. 
     
      
    61 Mr Sutherland SC opposed this direction (MFI137, pages 10-12; T4822-4825). The Crown submitted that such a direction ought be given (T4839-4841). 
     
      
    62 I was satisfied that directions concerning admissions ought be given to the jury, in particular given my conclusions in R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 7) and the approach of the Crown to relevant parts of the evidence in the Crown closing address. The issue had been raised in my earlier judgment delivered on 30 January 2007, and nothing had happened in the course of the trial to dissuade me from giving such directions. To the contrary, the conduct of the trial reinforced the need for such a direction. Accordingly, the written directions included a direction on that topic.  
     
      
       
      Provision of Chronology to Jury 
       
      
    63 As mentioned earlier in this judgment, I took the view that a chronology would assist the jury in their understanding of the substantial body of documentary evidence, and the relationship between that evidence and oral evidence of witnesses. The Crown and Defence provided draft chronologies, respectively MFI125 and MFI128. A draft chronology (MFI134) was prepared by me which represented a consolidation of the chronologies prepared by the parties with a number of deletions and additions (T4789-4790). I took the view that a useful measuring stick for including references to events in the chronology was whether the Crown and Mr Sutherland SC had referred to particular events in their lengthy closing addresses to the jury. 
     
      
    64 Courts have observed that the use of charts or chronologies in complicated jury trials is a desirable procedure and is to be encouraged: R v Mitchell [1971] VR 46 at 59-60; Smith v The Queen [1970] 121 CLR 572 at 577. It has been said that the use of written material to assist a jury in understanding, or readily assimilating, the effect of voluminous or complex evidence is also to be encouraged. In an appropriate case, the provision of a chronology is a desirable method of simplifying the task of a jury and of facilitating their deliberations. The jury is entitled to expect that all reasonable steps will be taken towards that desirable goal, especially in trials involving voluminous and/or complex factual evidence: R v Collins (1986) 44 SASR 214 at 249 per Olsson J.  
     
      
    65 A chronology is likely to be selective because it is, in substance, an extract of the dates in chronological order of events referred to in a large number of documents: R v Collins at 234 per Jacobs J. It has been said that there is a tendency, when the use of a chronology is considered, to underestimate the intelligence and commonsense of juries as to whether such material is likely to have an undue or inappropriate impact upon the jury’s thought processes: R v Collins at 249 per Olsson J.  
     
      
    66 In determining to provide a chronology to the jury, I proposed to emphasise that the chronology is not evidence in the trial, but a time line intended to assist the jury’s deliberations to be undertaken by reference to the actual evidence itself. I directed the jury to this effect when the chronology was provided, together with other written material in the jury folder (MFI142) at the commencement of the summing up. I reminded them during the summing up that the chronology was not a substitute for the evidence. 
     
      
    67 In R v Kardoulias [2005] NSWCCA 150, it was observed at [66] that the trial judge had prepared for the jury “a valuable chronology extending over the period 18 July 2001-24 April 2002 and covering some 50 pages listing the many telephone calls and meetings between the alleged conspirators”. This was in the context of a trial where, at [19]-[20], it was said that the evidence in the trial was essentially undisputed and unchallenged and the question was whether the jury ought be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused in light of the evidence (a circumstantial case). 
     
      
    68 In a number of respects, the present trial had similarities to R v Kardoulias. A substantial body of the evidence in the trial, in particular documentary evidence, was essentially undisputed and unchallenged. The question was what inferences should be drawn by the jury from the documents and other evidence, and the events (and conjunction of events) revealed by that evidence. In the same way as a chronology assisted the jury in R v Kardoulias, I took the view that a chronology would assist the jury in the present case. 
     
      
    69 The Crown supported the provision of a chronology to the jury. Mr Sutherland SC did not oppose such a course, with submissions touching upon the content of the chronology. 
     
      
    70 I considered the written submissions of the parties concerning particular entries in the chronology. As already stated, I adopted, as a starting point, an approach which considered whether counsel had referred to the particular event, and associated evidence, in their lengthy closing addresses. If not, it was difficult to see how the jury would be assisted by a reference to an event in the chronology. 
     
      
    71 The Accused objected to a number of entries in the chronology which included quotations or partial quotations from particular documents. It was submitted that the jury may use the chronology as a substitute for the evidence in these areas. The Crown submitted that such entries ought remain in the chronology. I took the view that quotations or partial quotations would assist the jury to recall the particular exhibits. As long as the jury received clear directions that the chronology ought not be considered in substitution for the exhibits themselves, it seemed to me that references of this type would serve to assist the jury to recall the particular documents. Oral directions to this effect were given to the jury, as I took them through the chronology and referred to the actual exhibits themselves from which quotations or partial quotations were taken. I was satisfied that this was the appropriate course to take.  
     
      
    72 There were other areas of debate concerning the chronology, none of which, in my view, assumed particular significance.  
     
      
    73 I was satisfied that the chronology would assist the jury in its deliberations and that the jury would utilise it in an intelligent and commonsense way. I was conscious of the responsibility of the trial judge to exercise discretion to ensure that the chronology did not give rise to unfairness to the Accused: R v Collins at 249. I was satisfied that the chronology would not be used by the jury in a manner which was unfair to the Accused.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    74 With respect to the principal areas of controversy concerning the proposed written directions and chronology, this judgment expresses my reasons for the conclusions expressed on 23 November 2007 concerning the written directions and chronology included in the jury folder (MFI142) provided to the jury at the commencement of the summing up.

      70236/2002 REGINA v John TAUFAHEMA 
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: John Taufahema, you appear for sentence after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Glenn McEnallay. You offered that plea to arraignment upon an indictment charging murder and the Crown has expressly accepted your plea of guilty to manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment. I have convicted you accordingly.  
     
      
    2 There are some matters which I should refer to. I will do so briefly, not to minimize their importance, but noting that you and your legal advisers are well aware of the chronology and I have made public statements earlier this year when imposing sentence on your brother Motekiai Taufahema for his participation in the events surrounding the killing of Senior Constable McEnallay. 
     
      
    3 You were one of the four occupants of a reportedly stolen motor car which he approached in the execution of his duty as a highway patrol officer. It was another occupant of the car, Sione Penisini, who produced a pistol and fired the shots which killed Senior Constable McEnallay.  
     
      
    4 You were presented for trial before Wood CJ at CL and pleaded guilty to using an offensive weapon in company with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, attempted carjacking and using a firearm without authority. You pleaded not guilty to murder but after trial you were found guilty by the jury. On 16 February 2007 the Court of Criminal Appeal allowed an appeal against that conviction and ordered a new trial. It is in respect of the new trial that the Crown indicated that it would be minded to accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter if you chose to offer it. As I have said, you did so, and that plea of guilty was effectively offered at the earliest opportunity. 
     
      
    5 There is an agreed statement of facts upon which I am content to proceed. These facts represent available findings from the evidence and I make those findings to the requisite standard. Included in the agreed facts is an express statement of the basis of your liability for the crime of manslaughter.  
     
      
    6 I should specify those facts. 
     
      
       
        
        “On 27 March 2002 John Taufahema, his brother Motekiai Taufahema, Meli Lagi and Sione Penisini went to Bankstown. They collected a green commodore sedan (hereafter ‘the commodore’). The vehicle was supplied to Penisini. The commodore’s owner had reported it stolen some months earlier. The report was false and was part of an attempted fraud on an insurance company. The occupants of the vehicle were not involved in the fraud, however each was on parole in relation to other offences. 
        
       
       
        
        Motekiai Taufahama drove the commodore from Bankstown to his flat in Little Bay. He was at that time unlicensed. The accused, Lagi and Penisini were passengers. On the way to the flat two off duty police officers noticed the commodore while it was driven in a fast and erratic manner in Botany Road Matraville. The officers followed the commodore to Little Bay but eventually lost sight of it. While looking for it they saw an unmarked police vehicle occupied by Constable McEnallay. They told him about the vehicle. Constable McEnallay made radio enquiries and established that the vehicle had been reported stolen. 
        
       
       
        
        Motekiai Taufahema drove the commodore from his flat at Mirrabooka Crescent Little Bay to Bunnerong Road. The other three men were in the vehicle, which also contained four fully loaded revolvers, two pairs of gloves, a quantity of ammunition and a hockey mask. The accused and his passengers had joint possession of the revolvers. It was established that they had been stolen from a security business in Marrickville on 14 March 2002. There is no evidence that the accused was involved in the theft. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 5.48 pm Senior Constable McEnallay started following the commodore. When he reached the intersection of Dennison Road and Beauchamp Road, Hillsdale he activated his vehicle’s siren and lights. Motekiai Taufahema then accelerated and made a sharp right hand turn into Grace Campbell Crescent. At around 5.51 pm the commodore was effectively immobilized. One of its wheels was damaged as the result of impact with the gutter or a traffic island. Constable McEnallay stopped the police vehicle a short distance from the commodore. 
        
       
       
        
        Penisini got out of the vehicle, pointed his revolver at the police officer and fired five shots. Four of the bullets struck Constable McEnallay in the chest and head. A week later he died from his wounds. Penisini, the accused and the other occupants ran from the vehicle. At that time each was armed with a loaded revolver. 
        
       
       
        
        John Taufahema and Penisini were arrested not far from the scene of the shooting. 
        
       
       
        
        Motekiai Taufahema ran down Grace Campbell Crescent. He entered the yard of a residence in Rhodes Street Hillsdale and hid the revolver in a garden. He was arrested a short time late and the revolver was found where he had hidden it. Lagi escaped but was arrested a few days later. 
        
       
       
        
        Basis of the accused’s liability for manslaughter 
        
       
       
        
        The accused admits that he was complicit in the act that caused Constable McEnallay’s death. His complicity arises from his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to possess the revolvers. They fall within the definition of ‘firearm’ in the version of the  
        Firearms Act 
         1996 applicable to this matter. Section 7(1) of that Act creates an offence if a person possesses a firearm without having a licence or permit to do so (foundational offence). The possession was an ongoing offence and included travelling in the vehicle with the loaded revolvers. Neither the accused nor the other occupants were authorised to have possession of the revolvers. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused contemplated the possibility that one of the occupants might discharge a revolver (incidental offence) but without the intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. In the absence of a lawful purpose, the firing of a firearm in or near a public place is a breach of section 93G(1)(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . That conduct would also constitute an unlawful and dangerous act. Penisini’s firing of the weapon caused Constable McEnallay’s death. Notwithstanding the accused’s contemplation that one of them might discharge one of the firearms he maintained his participation in the commission of the foundational crime.” 
        
       
      
    7 As I commented when sentencing your brother, and the same applies to you, and without engaging in a dissertation about liability for joint criminal enterprise, it is not, and never has been suggested that any physical act by you contributed to the actual homicide and your culpable mental state is as defined in the agreed facts which I have just read. 
     
      
    8 At the time of sentence following your now quashed conviction for murder, you were also sentenced for the other offences which I have mentioned and to which you had at that time, pleaded guilty. In each case you were sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment as follows: 
     
      
      (a) for using an offensive weapon in company with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, to imprisonment for 7 years dating from 27 March 2004; 
       
      (b) for attempted carjacking, to imprisonment for 6 years dating from 27 March 2002, and 
       
      (c) for using a firearm without authority, to imprisonment for 5 years dating from 27 March 2002. 
       
      
    9 Save the lastmentioned sentence which has expired, these sentences remain in effect. In imposing sentence today the principle of totality needs to be borne in mind and hence questions of cumulation and concurrency are matters which require the sentences which you are serving to be considered. 
     
      
    10 When Wood CJ at CL imposed those sentences, as well as the sentence for the conviction of murder which is now quashed, he ordered the sentence for murder to commence from 27 March 2005. At the time he made comprehensive remarks including an analysis of subjective matters which are applicable to you. Those remarks remain germane and rather than repeat them I will note that they are to be regarded as incorporated herein. 
     
      
    11 You have been in continuous custody since your arrest in 2002. There has been some updating from the tender of records concerning your history in custody. This has not been particularly impressive and there are disciplinary matters on the record. I see nothing in that material which I conclude should be used to your advantage, nor are they matters which persuade me that I should increase any assessment of sentence in order to reflect them. 
     
      
    12 When sentencing your brother I commented about the apparent inappropriateness of extreme high risk status in custody after the conviction for murder of a police officer had been quashed. Again, I draw attention to what I then said without repeating those remarks. Mr Cook who appeared for you asked me to accept that after this sentence is imposed your classification is likely to be reviewed and I will make that assumption. 
     
      
    13 At the sentence hearing Mr Robert McEnallay, the father of Glenn McEnallay read a victim impact statement on his own behalf and on behalf of the family. It was a moving tribute and a salutary reminder about the senseless and needless killing of a courageous young officer. There should be a formal recognition in these remarks of what Mr McEnallay had to say and of the continuing suffering and sense of loss which the family feels. 
     
      
    14 Two express submissions by Mr Cook were, first, that for the offence of manslaughter you should receive no greater sentence than that imposed on your brother and, second, that the commencement date of any sentence should remain that which Wood CJ at CL had used when imposing the sentence for murder. That date, as I have said, is 27 March 2005, being some three years after you were first taken into custody.  
     
      
    15 That commencing date of course takes into account questions of cumulation and currency such as I have earlier mentioned in connection with the existing sentences. 
     
      
    16 I am assisted by the candour of the Crown Prosecutor who responded that there was nothing he wished to say about the submissions made by Mr Cook concerning the commencement date nor about parity of sentence with Motekiai Taufahema. 
     
      
    17 My ultimate responsibility for imposing sentence cannot be removed by consent of the advocates but the submission and the concession are congruent with what I regard as appropriate assessment of penalty and consequential orders. In making that determination I do not overlook the circumstance that there are sentences absorbed in your overall term for offences which were not charged against your brother. 
     
      
    18 John Taufahema, for the manslaughter of Glenn McEnallay, you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 7 years dating from 27 March 2005 and expiring on 26 March 2012, with a balance term of 4 years dating from 27 March 2012. 
     
      
    19 The earliest date of eligibility for release to parole is specified as 26 March 2012.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Mikel Fajloun applies for bail. He was convicted along with his brother, by a jury, of two very serious offences. The convictions were last month. The offences involved the violent entry into the unit of Mr Raad Fajloun’s (Mr Mikel Fajloun’s brother) estranged wife, kidnapping her and detaining her at another place. The events were accompanied by physical violence and the use of an axe to break down a door. The victim was literally dragged from her home and put into a car driven by Mr Mikel Fajloun.2. Mr Tabchouri, who appeared for him today, supported his application for bail on the basis of the need to obtain psychiatric evidence. It would be much easier to obtain it if he was at liberty than if he were in custody. He emphasised the fact that his client is a contributor to the mortgage on the family home. The mortgage is overdue and his family is in significant financial difficulty. He emphasised Mr Mikel Fajloun’s community ties. He emphasised as well the different role which his client played in the offences compared with Mr Raad Fajloun.3. I regard the significant factor in this case as the fact that he has been convicted of two very serious offences by a jury. Once again it seems to me to be likely, although I do not pre-judge this, that he will face a period of full-time custody. The obtaining of any psychiatric evidence in order to support his case on sentence may be more difficult or expensive because he is in custody but it can still be obtained and will not prejudice his position.4. As strong as his community ties are and as difficult as his custody will be for his family, given their financial circumstances, those factors do not, in my opinion, outweigh the appropriateness for him to be in custody having been convicted by the jury. His role was different to his brother’s in the sense that he accompanied his brother and his brother was probably the initiator of the exercise. However, he accompanied his brother into the unit, accompanied his brother in removing forcibly his brother’s wife and drove the car to the place where she was kept. For a short period of time he was present there as well. His different role in the crimes was not such that it would warrant a significantly varied approach to a bail application.5. The Crown also expresses concern for the victim of the crimes. Her security arrangements have been changed based upon the fact that Mr Mikel Fajloun and his brother are in custody.6. For all of the above reasons I do not regard this as an appropriate case for bail and I refuse the application.

   Introduction1. The plaintiff and the defendant own adjoining rural properties. The defendant owns and resides at a rural property which is almost entirely surrounded by land owned by the plaintiff, situated off the Tarana Road at Raglan, near Bathurst in New South Wales. 2. The plaintiff by way of statement of claim filed on 26 May 2006 claims damages from the defendant for defamation for four oral publications to an employee of the plaintiff, Mr John Sydney Hasler, which occurred on 14 October 2002, 18 December 2005 and 26 March 2006. Commencement of defamation proceedings between two neighbours3. I shall first set out a brief summary of the progress of these proceedings in the District Court. The statement of claim was amended in August 2006 to enlarge the text of each of these publications. On 27 September 2006, I handed down a judgment in relation to challenges to the imputations (Hennessy v Lynch [2006] NSWDC 26). Following the filing of amended pleadings, a fourth publication dated 6 October 2000 was added.4. In my judgment of 13 October 2006 (Hennessy v Lynch (No. 2) [2006] NSWDC 49) I set out the text of each of the four matters complained of and I will not repeat their content here.5. On 14, 15 and 16 February 2007, a section 7A jury was empanelled to determine whether each of the oral publications had been published by the defendant to Mr Hasler. Mr Hasler gave evidence and was cross-examined. The defendant did not give evidence. The jury in answers to questions held that the following imputations were conveyed and defamatory: 
     
     First publication 
      
      
     (a) That the plaintiff is a former bankrupt. 
      
      
     Second publication 
      
      
     (a) That the plaintiff is a former bankrupt. 
      
     (b) That the plaintiff is a bankrupt. 
      
     (d) That the plaintiff is not credit-worthy. 
      
     (e) That the plaintiff does not pay his accounts on time. 
      
     (f) That the plaintiff was refused further credit by Fish & Sons. 
      
     (g) That the plaintiff was refused credit by Alan Wilding. 
      
      
     Third publication 
      
      
     (a) That the plaintiff is a former bankrupt. 
      
      
     Fourth publication 
      
      
     (b) That the plaintiff is a former bankrupt. 
      
     (c) That the plaintiff is not credit-worthy. 
      
     (d) That the plaintiff did not pay his account at Sid Newhams. 
      
     (e) That the plaintiff did not pay his account at Fish & Sons. 
      
     (f) That the plaintiff was refused credit by Sid Newhams. 
      
     (g) That the plaintiff was refused credit by Fish & Sons. 
      
    6. Following the section 7A trial, an amended defence pleading substantive defences of justification to imputations 9(d), 9(e), 9(f) and 9(g) and 15(d), 15(e), 15(f) and 15(g) as well as a defence of contextual truth, together with a defence of qualified privilege at common law (for all four publications) and unlikelihood of harm (again for all four publications). On the first day of the trial, the defendant sought leave to file in court a further amended defence withdrawing the defence of contextual truth to the third and fourth publication and the defence of common law qualified privilege to all four publications. Accordingly the sole defence is a defence under section 13.7. The matter was listed for hearing between 27 and 30 August and 4 September 2007. It was stood over for further directions to Friday 14 September to permit the parties to provide additional written submissions.The issues in the proceedings8. The issues identified by the parties are straightforward. First, there is the question of whether section 13 can provide a defence to one or more of the four publications. Secondly, there is the issue of damages, including a claim by the plaintiff for aggravated compensatory damages. Aggravated compensatory damages are claimed by reason of the five particulars set out in paragraph 18 of the third further amended statement of claim and in addition on two other bases. The first of these is the pleading of a defence of truth and contextual truth, which was abandoned on the first day of the trial and the second is the conduct of the trial itself, including cross-examination as to the falsity of the imputations.The evidence9. The plaintiff, whose curriculum vitae was tendered (exhibit G), told the court that his great grandfather had been born in the area in 1832. Subsequently the plaintiff’s grandfather and mother were born in the area and had rural holdings. His younger brother, Mr Peter Hennessy QC, also has a substantial holding in the same area (T-4). His ninety-four year old uncle was the Mayor of Turon Shire for twenty-seven years and the Deputy Mayor of Bathurst for ten years. The plaintiff’s uncle was involved with grazing until the latter years of his life and his grandfather was a grazier all his life in that area. It is a social pattern in the area that farmers going back generations seem to inter-marry with people in the area and the plaintiff has many relatives in the area as a result.10. The circumstances of publication of the first matter complained of were as follows. The plaintiff said (T-7) that early in 2002 he had a telephone conversation with Mr Hasler, whom he employed to manage his farmland. Mr Hasler told him he had been approached by the defendant and a “heated discussion” took place during which the defendant alleged to Mr Hasler that the plaintiff was a former bankrupt. Mr Hasler said that this conversation occurred about a week after his commencing work with the plaintiff. The plaintiff then learned, later in 2002, that the plaintiff had made further allegations about him, namely the publication giving rise to the imputations found by the section 7A jury set out above.11. The plaintiff said he was shocked and bewildered because he had never been confronted with any such allegation before, and he was concerned because he was a chartered accountant. The allegation was completely false. The plaintiff decided that as he had only recently acquired the property which was adjacent to the defendant’s, he should give Mr Lynch a chance in that with the effluxion of time Mr Lynch would come to understand the allegation was baseless. His overwhelming concern was that this allegation might be repeated to other people. He said at T-11: 
     
     “ 
     It heightened and intensified the hurt and the injustice, the frustration, the abhorrent [sic] of what was said about me. That it would be repeated to many people. Because of the very nature of the community and where we share contractors, agents merchants. And that was my great concern. Not that it was said to Mr Hasler as such, but rather it went way beyond Mr Hasler. 
     ” 
    12. In late 2002 the plaintiff consulted a firm of solicitors in Bathurst. They sent the following letter to Mr Lynch on 26 November 2002:  
     
     “Dear Mr Lynch  
      
      
     RE: PAUL HENNESSY  
      
      
     We have been consulted by Mr Hennessy concerning comments made by you about him in a telephone conversation with Mr S Hassler [sic] an employee of Mr Hennessy’s on 14 October 2002. In that telephone conversation we are instructed that amongst other things you said to Mr Hassler about Mr Hennessy that: 
      
      
     1. Mr Paul Hennessy had been bankrupt. 
      
     2. That Mr Hennessy was not able to get credit at some business houses in Bathurst. 
      
     3. That Mr Hassler had no ethics working for Mr Hennessy and that he would work for Bin Laden. 
      
      
     Those allegations are false and clearly defamatory. 
      
      
     As you are aware, Mr Hennessy is an Accountant in professional practice in Bathurst and Sydney and the comments made by you concerning him are grave and adversely reflect on his competence, professional ability and on his position in the community. 
      
      
     We are instructed therefore to request that you submit to us within seven days, a clear and unqualified apology and retraction in the form attached to this letter. 
      
      
     Upon receipt of that apology our client will then consider his position in regard to commencement of legal proceedings against you for defamation. 
      
      
     We are instructed to give notice that if we do not have the signed written apology within the time specified, legal proceedings may issue without further notice to you seeking damages. In the meantime our client reserves his rights.” 
    13. Attached to this letter was the following draft apology:  
     
     “ 
     APOLOGY TO PAUL HENNESSY 
      
      
     I John Lynch of “Dockairne”, Raglan did on 14 October 2002 in a telephone conversation make a number of statements about Paul Hennessy. I acknowledge that I said: 
      
      
     1. Mr Paul Hennessy had been bankrupt. 
      
     2. That Mr Paul Hennessy was not able to get credit at some business houses in Bathurst. 
      
     3. That Mr Hassler (an employee of Mr Hennessy) had no ethics working for Mr Hennessy and that he would work for Bin Laden. 
      
      
     These statements are completely without foundation and I wholly retract them. 
      
      
     I greatly regret any distress or embarrassment that my statements may have caused to Paul Hennessy and I apologise to Paul Hennessy and withdraw those statements unreservedly. 
      
      
     Dated: 
      
      
     ……………………………………… 
      
     John Lynch” 
    14. It is apparent from this letter that this is a reference solely to the second publication and not to the first. This is the subject about which the plaintiff was cross-examined in some detail and I discuss this evidence further below.15. No reply was ever received to the letter. The plaintiff was asked how he felt about not receiving any suggested offer of apology or response other than a complaint from a local solicitor that the letter should have been sent to him:“I felt that Lynch had demonstrated arrogance, insensitive [sic], uncompromising approach to an extremely hurtful allegation with [sic] any substance, without any foundation and which I found to be extremely malicious and vicious.” (T-13)16. The plaintiff received legal advice to “let it go” and he decided to do so.17. In his evidence Mr Hasler said (T-82) that when he had the second conversation, by telephone, he was of the opinion that the defendant was affected by alcohol (T-82.27) and that he told the plaintiff this. This appears to have been a factor in the plaintiff not taking the matter further.18. Over the next three years there was no recurrence of any defamatory publication. However, the relationship between the parties over this period of time continued to be strained. The problem appears to have been that the plaintiff’s property completely encircled the defendant’s and there were disputes about access roads, as the statutory declaration of Mr Hasler (exhibit C) sets out. Mr Hasler says in paragraph 20 of exhibit C that over the next two years he did not record any conversations with the defendant, although he spoke to him regularly, and these conversations do not appear to have been friendly. 19. According to the plaintiff’s evidence, the relationship over this period was “manageable” (T-31). There were complaints to the police and “police proceedings”, but these had been finalised in the earlier part of 2002 (T-32). However, the defendant continued to live on a landlocked holding (T-32) and there were a number of complaints initiated by the plaintiff against the defendant concerning the providing of fencing applications and a dispute about cattle (T-37.31-.34). There were constant complaints by the defendant that he could not get out of his landlocked property because he was having problems getting access to travel over the plaintiff’s property.20. It is indicative of the ongoing problems that on 18 October 2002 Mr Hasler wrote a letter following publication of the second matter complained of in which he reported the defendant as saying that the reason for the plaintiff’s conduct was that the plaintiff was “trying to get him out, as you want to have his property” (T-170-171). The plaintiff denied this allegation. He agreed he had made an offer to purchase shortly after publication of the second matter complained of but said that he did not make the offer privately, but when the property was on the market he made an offer.21. The following occurred at T-171: 
     
     “Q. And of course you knew that he was landlocked, wasn’t he? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. And after you purchased your landholding in that area, denied him access by routes that he was previously permitted access by, didn’t you? 
      
     A. Only after he did some appallingly unneighbourly things. 
      
      
     Q. Can you answer my question, did you deny access or not? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. These appalling neighbourly— 
      
     A. Just – he had access but there was further access across the railway crossing. Now, he impounded my cattle, and the police had to – and he was very unneighbourly, I said “John, I won’t allow it, but for emergencies, you can use it”. 
      
      
     Q. This is the matter we were talking about earlier in the week when you said you were being cordial with him and then you said you thought it was 2003 and I reminded you it was 2001, do you remember that? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. And the reason why you say you did nothing or said nothing about the 2001 publication was that you were trying to be cordial and get on with your neighbour? 
      
     A. Yes, and the advice from a lawyer at the time— 
      
      
     Q. But you didn’t see a lawyer at the time? 
      
     [Objection] 
      
      
     Q. Sorry, the advice from a lawyer at the time? 
      
     A. Was not to pursue it. 
      
      
     Q. That’s at the end of 2002? 
      
     A. 2002, yes. 
      
      
     Q. I’m talking about the initial publication that came to your attention in March of 2002 that your servant said occurred in October of 2001? 
      
     A. That’s correct. 
      
      
     Q. You said that, if I remember correctly, you did nothing about that because you wanted to be cordial and get on with your neighbour? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
      
     Q. And that was just false, wasn’t it, because all of the matters you’ve just adverted to and the things I said to you previously? 
      
     A. Not at all.” 
    22. In the weeks leading up to the third matter complained of, according to Mr Hasler’s evidence (exhibit C, paragraph 23), Mr Hasler rang the defendant to say that his bull was in the lucerne paddock and asked him to come and get it. When he did not come for six weeks, Mr Hasler put the bull calf into another paddock.23. On Sunday, 18 December 2005 the defendant attempted to call Mr Hasler about five times. He contacted Mr Hasler eventually at about 6.00pm or shortly thereafter to say that he and his solicitor had measured the easements for the new yards which were four feet over the easement line and they had to be moved.24. Mr Hasler replied “I have no intentions of moving the yards and you can get stuffed”.25. Mr Lynch replied saying that Mr Hasler should not have sown lucerne onto part of the easement and that the defendant was going to put a grid in the corner where he wanted to and not where Mr Hasler wanted him to. He went on to say that he knew Mr Hasler’s problem in that he had bankrupted three people he had worked for. Mr Hasler replied “John, you wouldn’t know what you are fuckin talking about”. Mr Lynch then replied, “You’re working for a former bankrupt” to which Mr Hasler said, “It is none of your bloody business”. Mr Hasler terminated the call. I have set out the text to explain how it was that after three years the allegation of bankruptcy had come up again.26. There was no further communication of substance between the defendant and Mr Hasler until Sunday, 26 February 2006. The defendant and Mr Hasler were still having trouble concerning the defendant’s young bull, which persisted in wanting to join the young female cows. Mr Lynch was wanting to go over and get the young bull but Mr Hasler said “I don’t like my cattle being disturbed and I will get him out”. Mr Hasler later did that and rang the defendant to ask him to collect the bull. The defendant said he would pick up the bull that afternoon. The bull was still there the next day so Mr Hasler rang to find out what was going on. The defendant replied “The bull beat me as I was taking him home”, from which I infer that the bull escaped and returned to be with the cows. Mr Hasler said he would return the bull to Mr Lynch’s property later that day. 27. Nevertheless, the bull managed to get back into the plaintiff’s property again on 15 March and again on 18 March, having travelled through three paddocks to get there. The bull was a very determined one and returned again on 26 March 2006. On 27 March 2006 Mr Hasler got the bull out of the paddock and back to the defendant’s property. This caused Mr Hasler a lot of trouble and he had words with the plaintiff which resulted in the plaintiff saying “I don’t talk to you Sid – ring my solicitor if you have anything to say”. Mr Hasler accordingly left a message on the defendant’s answer phone saying “I have put your bull back to your property and if he gets in again I will impound him”. (The impounding process means that the bull is sent to the pound at Bathurst who contact the registered owner via the tag on the bull and arrange for collection of the bull after the payment of a fee).28. On Monday, 27 March 2006 the defendant rang Mr Hasler. This is the conversation which is the fourth matter complained of. Mr Hasler said that the defendant’s tone of voice was very assertive and abusive, his speech was slurred and he kept repeating the same thing over and over again and Mr Hasler “formed the view that he was affected by alcohol” (paragraph 31 of the statutory declaration).29. The text of this conversation is set out in paragraph 6 of my judgment of 13 October 2006 ([2006] NSWDC 49). It was an angry conversation which the defendant opened by references to insults addressed to both Mr Hasler and the plaintiff, to which Mr Hasler responded by calling the defendant “a fucking dickhead”.30. Mr Hasler hung up on the defendant. The defendant attempted to call back at least five times in the next fifteen minutes but Mr Hasler recognised his number and did not answer his telephone. On Tuesday, 4 April 2006 he impounded the defendant’s bull and on 16 April he received a telephone call from the defendant to say that he had been to the police station and taken out an AVO. In fact, no court process for an AVO was ever served on Mr Hasler.31. Mr Hasler was used to drunken calls from the defendant. In paragraph 36 he deposes that on two other occasions when the defendant rang up speaking in an assertive and abusive tone of voice with slurred speech the telephone conversations were terminated by a loud click which was the disconnection of the call from the defendant’s telephone in mid-sentence. On each occasion he said to the defendant “What was the bullshit about last night?” to which the defendant replied “Disregard everything I said”.32. Mr Hasler kept a diary note of his conversations (exhibit D). These diary notes confirm these conversations and also his opinion about the defendant’s state of intoxication.33. The plaintiff’s evidence about how he learnt of the third and fourth publications were as follows. The day after the third publication Mr Hasler rang the plaintiff and said that the defendant was “at it again”.34. The plaintiff’s description of how he felt was as follows: 
     
     “Again greatly distressed, greatly distressed and hurt, and think my gosh who else has he spoken to? This has been going on for four years. And I’ve given him warning. He knows how injurious it can be to me and my career, my reputation. The thought of a chartered accountant being a bankrupt is horrific. It could destroy my credibility and my whole practice and be excruciatingly embarrassing to all my friends and associates. Incomprehensible that I should have to contest the allegations that I’m a former bankrupt or creditworthy. Particularly as I spent so much money in that community, income and in the city, paid to 185 merchants and nobody, but nobody, had been able to take action against me successfully to recover any alleged unpaid account. I felt absolutely violated.” (T-14.30-.34) 
    35. The plaintiff learnt of the fourth publication two or three days after it was said. He was asked how he felt about the fourth publication and he said (T-15-16): 
     
     “Deeply hurt and offended. And I thought the matter was getting out of control that I had somebody who was being extremely vindictive and treacherous towards me. He seemed to have an obsession about me. He seemed to be having no regard for the truth. I thought well with these vicious allegations at least he’d behove [sic] somebody to say well they’re extreme allegations, I should give some evidence, because I’d already warned him four years ago this is not true, this is very injurious, please stop. Please give me an apology. He just showed defiance.” 
    36. The plaintiff said he had very grave concerns that the fourth publication might go further to merchants and business houses, his professional colleagues and his friends and relatives. He was very concerned about commencing proceedings because he said he felt that they were “going to put enormous pressure on me and pre-occupy me for perhaps the next 18 months”.37. The plaintiff’s distress did not stop after he sought legal advice. After proceedings were commenced the plaintiff went to a function at the home of a Mr and Mrs Hooper. He was told by Mr Hooper, a chartered accountant in practise in Bathurst, that the defendant’s solicitor had contacted a shareholder at Sid Newhams and was wanting to obtain information about the case and whether in fact the plaintiff had short paid Sid Newhams. Mr Hooper also gave this evidence. The plaintiff said that as a result of hearing this information he became extremely agitated and told his wife that they should go home and they then left.38. The plaintiff said he was particularly distressed by the s.7A hearing and said he found it “extremely difficult and distressful to listen to the conduct of the advocate for the defendant” (T-19.50-.51). He was very embarrassed during the s.7A trial because counsel for the defendant was someone he had known for some fifteen years (T-22).39. The plaintiff was very angry that there was a plea of partial justification. He said he was shocked, nonplussed and thought that the defendant and his legal advisers were being vexatious and vindictive and seeking to drag out these proceedings which went with claims that were wholly without foundation. He felt bewilderment at the plea of qualified privilege and found it incomprehensible that the defendant had pleaded a duty to publish these matters. His response to the defence of unlikelihood of harm was: 
     
     “I felt these lawyers will say anything. These lawyers will say anything.” 
    40. He said in relation to the certification of the pleadings: 
     
     “Mr Neil, much of my professional time is giving opinions, primarily audit opinions. In giving an audit opinion you never – you realise that what the word “certified” means, certified absolute truthful non-negotiable, absolute. How could a lawyer certify that there are reasonable grounds for believing on the basis of provable facts and a reasonably arguable view of the law that the defence to the claim for damages in these proceedings has reasonable prospects of success. How could he write it, let alone sign it? … I felt betrayed by the legal profession, and Mr Neil. I felt despair. … I thought these people must have evidence that I don’t know exists, must have some – I was just nonplussed. Could I just add, I understand that the defendant also said on oath, he said on oath, I said he’s saying this on oath what facts has he got … I thought his vicious, vindictive, he has an absolute obsession with me, he wants to make my life a nightmare, he’s going to continue this frivolous action against me, break up enormous costs to me, enormous stress to me and my family and friends and put on hold my life in my sixty-seventh year.” (T-24-25) 
    41. While the plaintiff blamed the defendant, he made a number of references to both Mr Weaver and Mr Campbell SC, the counsel for the defendant. The following occurred at T-25: 
     
     “Q. How did you feel when you read that the defendant had said he did not undertake any steps to satisfy himself of the truth of the implications [sic] until after service of the statement of claim? 
      
     A. Mr Neil, I felt a number of emotions. The plaintiff, reckless indifference, but I thought there are parties supposedly more responsible than him, a party to these, there is the solicitor, there is the barrister. How must they feel, how must they feel? 
      
      
     Q. Let me ask you this— 
      
     A. You may shake your head Mr Campbell, you may shake your head. 
      
      
     Q. Please Mr Hennessy. 
      
     Her Honour: 
      
      
     Q. Look, just one moment, sir, you are here to answer questions, please. I understand how you feel but please restrict your answers to Mr Neil’s questions, not to comments about Mr Campbell being at the bar table, thank you. 
      
     A. Yes.” (T-25) 
    42. This is an indication of the very strong feelings the plaintiff had. He repeated them at T-62: 
     
     “Q. How do you feel about having been asked questions by Mr Campbell about these matters of your trading and arrangements with the various merchants that he asked you about? 
      
     A. I feel violated to sit here and have those questions put.” 
      
    43. Although the plaintiff had very strong feelings about the conduct of the defendant, he was able to conduct litigation during this time with other persons without feeling the same kind of emotions. Insights into this can be gleaned from a judgment of Young CJ in Equity in Cuming v Hennessy [2005] NSWSC 1219, which concerned an application by the plaintiff’s former partner for the appointment of an interim receiver and manager following the breakdown of a relationship between two accountants: Cuming v Hennessy [2005] NSWSC 1219. The plaintiff did not regard the breakdown of his business relationship with his former partner as a matter of significance. In fact, he did not even tell his wife about it: 
     
     “Q. You know that the business relationship that your husband has had broke down in 2005, didn’t it? 
      
     A. What business relationship are you talking about? 
      
      
     Q. His accountancy business where he was in partnership with another person? 
      
     A. Who was that? 
      
      
     Q. You have no knowledge about that at all? 
      
     A. I don’t know which one you’re referring to. 
      
      
     Q. Your husband didn’t tell you anything at all about how he had to go to court and how there are problems with his accountancy business? 
      
     A. My husband’s accountancy business is his business. We very rarely discuss what goes on in his business. 
      
      
     Q. So you knew nothing about somebody trying to put a receiver into the business? 
      
     A. No. 
      
      
     Q. So you don’t know what other stresses your husband may have had in his life as a result of his business dealings, is that right, throughout this period we’re talking about? 
      
     A. No.” (T-70-71) 
      
    44. Mrs Hennessy was aware that there had been problems with Mr Lynch “over the past five or six years”. She thought there had been numerous calls from Mr Lynch but that her husband was a stoic sort of character who did not discuss in great detail any problems that he had. She said that two of the calls related to a claim that her husband was bankrupt, that his accounts were out of order, that he had been refused credit at various companies in Bathurst and there were threats to Mr Hasler about dealing with him in various ways. She said her husband was “most distressed” and “very very upset” and that since these calls she has noticed that he becomes agitated very quickly and does not sleep very well. She said her husband worried that these sort of rumours, if they were allowed to go unchecked, could ruin his business and that her husband had worked very hard in his profession and was rightfully proud of what he had achieved. He was distressed by the litigation and felt that his life was on hold. She has noticed that he has become extremely stressed and will suddenly start talking about something completely inappropriate, which she attributes to distress caused by the matter complained of. As a result of the publication her husband needed sleeping tablets, tended to fly off the handle quickly and was suffering from the strain of litigation and extremely distressed (T-67-69).45. The plaintiff’s secretary, Olga Haywood, gave evidence about the effect of the publications on him. She said he was “a different person really” after the publications (T-72).46. Mrs Haywood has been the plaintiff’s secretary since 2003, which post-dates the first two matters complained of. She recalled him being upset because the defendant had said he was bankrupt, that he was like Osama Bin Laden and that he was not creditworthy but that she could not remember anything else (T-72). She said that this had a big impact on his personality in that his sense of humour seemed to have gone out the window and that she was concerned about his health and had had a look on the internet to see what to do in the event of an emergency. This does tend to suggest that the plaintiff’s personality was more affected by the later than by the earlier publications, since the happier personality she describes postdates these publications.47. Mrs Haywood knew that the plaintiff had had “a pretty nasty split up” with his former partnership and that this was very distressing to him and had an impact on his health (T-75). She was also aware of a court case where he was trying to recover fees and was unsuccessful and ordered to pay the costs. However, she thought the case did not have anywhere near the same effect on the plaintiff as these proceedings had had. She agreed that the plaintiff’s work created stress to a certain extent.48. Dr Gunning gave evidence concerning the plaintiff’s reputation, which he said was excellent in that he was an upstanding figure who was held in high regard by all people he comes in contact with. The plaintiff had told Dr Gunning how stressed he was about the defamation proceedings and Dr Gunning had noticed a change in his personality and in recent years he had noticed the plaintiff had become more withdrawn.49. Mr Ian Hooper, a director of the firm known as Sid Newham Rural Supplies, gave evidence (T-94) and said that, in addition to being of high reputation, the plaintiff was “very creditworthy” in that he “will always pay his bill”. He said that to his knowledge there were no problems with the accounts at Newhams.The evidence of the defendant50. The defendant did not give evidence. However, Mr Kent George Fish of Fish & Sons Rural Produce Centre Pty Ltd was called to give evidence going to the falsity of the imputations, the falsity of the imputations being particularised (paragraph 18(c)) as being the basis of a claim for aggravated compensatory damages in the plaintiff’s statement of claim. There is no plea of bad reputation.51. Mr Fish gave evidence about the circumstances in which the words “overdue” appeared beside approximately 100 entries in the remittance advices sent to the plaintiff during the time that they had a trading relationship. He said he first came to meet the plaintiff in about 2000 and he dealt with the plaintiff between 10 August and 22 December 2000. The account became non-active until it was re-opened on 11 August 2003. The first invoice sent to Mr Hennessy in 2003 was sent on 11 April 2003. Mr Fish described the procedure he took when accounts were overdue. He described how on several occasions he spoke to Mr Hennessy or Mr Hasler to ask for the account to be paid. He said that when Mr Hennessy said that the bill would be fixed up it would be fixed, but “not immediately” and that “every month it would be a phone call but, I mean, days turned into weeks and it’d be a couple of months as sort of showing on there that things weren’t being attended to on a regular monthly basis, even though it’d turn out to a sixty day account, once the ball was rolling it just kept perpetuating into just past that” (T-106).52. The last transaction he had was when Mr Hasler came to the shop wanting some insect spray. As Mr Fish had not been able to get into contact with Mr Hennessy, he asked Mr Hasler to pay $17.95 in cash, which Mr Hasler did (T-108).53. Shortly after that Mr Fish received a telephone call from Mr Hennessy. Mr Hennessy said to Mr Fish “I believe you owe me an apology” which Mr Fish said “Sort of caught me on the back foot to start with”. Mr Hennessy told Mr Fish, “You have told one of my employees that my account is on the stop”. Mr Fish replied that he was not getting his accounts paid on time. He was told either to apologise for this or Mr Hennessy would close his account and send a cheque for the outstanding balance, which was in fact what occurred because Mr Fish said he would not apologise because he was not in the wrong. Accordingly, the account was closed. The invoice in question is 8 August 2005.54. Mr Fish had earlier written to the plaintiff along the following lines: 
     
     “Paul, please understand. Our move to the new site has cost us a lot of money. Cash flow is important. I cannot offer 60 days at the moment. Could you please pay all overdues as a favour. Thank you Kent Fish.” 
    55. This was attached to a remittance advice dated 1 August 2005.56. There are other notes in the statements. For example, the statement for Wednesday, 15 October 2003 contains the note “could we attend to overdues as soon as possible. Regards Kent” and there is a reference to a late payment fee. The account dated Monday, 1 November 2004 contains the words “please Paul”, and the account for Friday, 1 April contains the handwritten word “please”.57. The plaintiff gave evidence in reply in which he explained (T-143) that on his understanding of when the 60 days ran, he was not in default. He was sure that his secretary, whom he described as a reliable employee, would have attended to payments very promptly. He spent many hours preparing a schedule to assist the Court in understanding whether or not he was in fact paying his accounts late.58. The plaintiff also tendered a bundle of documents from Newham Rural Supplies (exhibit 7). Although Mr Hooper, a director of this company, gave evidence that he regarded the plaintiff as very creditworthy, a number of these accounts have a little rubber stamp showing a man crying and contain the words: 
     
     “ 
     account is overdue! 
      
     please send cheque 
      
     Urgently 
     ”. 
    59. The plaintiff, in his evidence in reply, indicated an intention to seek aggravated damages by reason of the leading of the evidence of Mr Fish.60. The entitlement of a defendant to lead evidence of the truth of a defamatory imputation even though no plea of justification is on the record is explained by McHugh JA in Singleton v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR 425 at 443. The evidence of falsity of imputations concerning the plaintiff’s failure to pay his accounts on time, being refused credit by Fish & Sons and other proprietors needs to be seen in this context. This is in fact evidence going to the bulk of the imputations. Essentially, only the imputations of being a former bankrupt are matters to which this evidence cannot run.61. Having set out the evidence I now turn to the contested issues in this case. The issues are whether the defence of s.13 can succeed in respect of any of the publications and, secondly, the quantum of damages to be awarded to the plaintiff.Section 1362. Section 13 Defamation Act 1974 (NSW) provides: 
     
     “ 
     Unlikelihood of harm 
      
      
     13. It is a defence that the circumstances of the publication of the matter complained of were such that the person defamed was not likely to suffer harm.” 
    63. There are similar provisions in s.20 Defamation Act 1889 (Qld) and s.9(2) Defamation Act 1957 (Tas) both of which, like s.13, require there to be a causal link between the unlikelihood of injury and the circumstances or “occasion” to use the word appearing in each of these sections of the publication. However, the defences in Queensland and Tasmania are limited to slander cases, as were the statutory predecessors to s.13.64. There is no equivalent defence in the common law or in any other State or Territory of Australia, and it could fairly be said that the defence is unique to this country.65. The explanation for the introduction of this unusual provision for the discouraging of actions for slander, enacted as long ago as 1847, comes from Australia’s colourful past as a pioneer and convict colony. The New South Wales Law Reform Commission’s 1971 Report, which led to the enactment of s.13 and extended it to written publications as well as oral publications, contained the following explanation at paragraph 60: 
     
     “When New South Wales in 1847 made slander actionable without proof of special damage, doubtless it was thought desirable at the same time to discourage trivial actions for slander. The means adopted was to provide by section 2 of the Act 11 Vict No.13 for a defence to an action for slander where the words complained of did not impute an indictable offence and were spoken on an occasion when the plaintiff’s character was not likely to be injured. This defence remained part of the law in New South Wales up to 1959 when a generally similar section derived from a Queensland variant was introduced (Defamation Act, 1958, s.20(1)). Under present-day conditions there is no reason why there should be a difference between written and spoken words. In the proposed section 13, tests of injury to character or reputation are abandoned in favour of a more general test: was the person defamed likely to suffer substantial harm? The question whether the matter complained of imputes and [sic] indictable offence is immaterial under the 1958 Act and would be immaterial under section 13 of the Bill. The sections confers upon juries a useful reserve power and its existence tends to discourage trivial actions.” 
    66. The defence was rarely the subject of judicial comment prior to Lang v Willis (1934) 52 CLR 637, where the defence succeeded in relation to political speeches made during a by-election. Rich J noted (at 650) the role of the defence in Australia’s colonial past when it was introduced “to meet the hard conditions of pioneer days”. His Honour went on to note that this was because a different view might be taken concerning words spoken in a bar or during a family squabble to statements made during a church vestry meeting or at a directors meeting.67. The plaintiff submits that the test is whether in the circumstances of the publication the plaintiff was not likely to suffer harm. This requires proof of the absence of a real chance or possibility of harm: see Jones v Sutton (2004) 61 NSWLR 614, Ainsworth v Burden [2006] NSWCA 199.68. The plaintiff in further written submissions submits that Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Ltd (1984) Aust Torts Rep 80-691 “sets out the law which, it is submitted, has not been changed by later decisions” and particularly draws my attention to the statement of Moffitt P at 68-947: 
     
     “For the defence to be available the “circumstances  
     of the publication 
     ” must be “ 
     such that 
     ” the person defamed was not likely to suffer harm (emphasis added). The words “such that” are important. The quality of the circumstances  
     of the publication 
      must be the factor which renders it unlikely that the person defamed will suffer harm.” 
    69. The correctness of Chappell was canvassed in arguments before the Court of Appeal in King and Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie (1991) 24 NSWLR 305 at 309-311 and 318. The facts in that case were not dissimilar to the present, in that the matter complained of was only published to persons previously aware of its contents (and with their own information as to truth or falsity). The defendant submitted that as a result the persons to whom the publication was made would not have taken a different view of him as a result of the publication, and for this reason the plaintiff was not likely to suffer harm. The Court of Appeal considered the defence should have gone to the jury on this basis. However, all three appeal judges expressed reservations about the correctness of Chappell. However, Mahoney JA (with whom Meagher JA agreed) expressed the view that even if he believed Chappell to have been wrongly decided, leave would not be granted to argue its incorrectness as the previous court had unanimously adopted one of two acceptable constructions of the section and the decision had been acted upon over a period of years.70. Central to this judgment was the statement by Mahoney JA that the defence places a significant burden on the defendant, who must negative not merely that there had been great or substantial harm, that there had been “harm at all”. This led to a series of decisions where the defence failed on this basis. 71. In Assaf v Skalkos [1999] NSWSC 1332 Carruthers J noted at [13] that in King and Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie Mahoney JA had held that the s.13 defence “places a significant burden upon the defendant: he must negative not merely that there would be a great or substantial harm, but that there could be harm at all”. His Honour went on to note at paragraph 60 that the test was as follows: 
     
     “I have referred to the test, if I could use that expression, identified by Mahoney JA in  
     King and Mergen Holdings 
     , namely the defendants must negative not merely that there would be great or substantial harm but that there be harm at all.” 
    72. Carruthers J referred to the decision of Badgery-Parker J in Perkins v New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council (Supreme Court of New South Wales, 15 August 1997, unreported) where the test had been stated in more generous terms and permitted to go to the jury; Carruthers J noted that he had “given it [the judgment] such weight, if I may respectfully say so, as I feel in the circumstances of this particular case it bears” (at [49]) but did not accept its correctness.73. The defendant in Assaf v Skalkos appealed the trial judge’s refusal to permit a s.13 defence to go to the jury. The Court of Appeal, in rejecting this ground of appeal, noted at [77] that: 
     
     “Carruthers J pointed out that the test identified by Mahoney JA in  
     King and Mergen Holdings 
      (at 309) was that the defendant bore the significant burden of negativing not merely that there would be great or substantial harm but that there be “harm” at all.” 
    74. Leave to appeal to the High Court in Assaf v Skalkos was refused, as was leave to appeal in Mergen Holdings v McKenzie.75. In McMullen v TCN Channel 9 Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 925 Dunford J referred with approval to the test enunciated by Mahoney JA and noted at [85]: 
     
     “It must be shown that the plaintiff was unlikely to suffer, not great or substantial harm, but any harm at all.” 
    76. Mr Neil QC for the plaintiff opened his case on the basis that the test was as set out in King and Mergen Holdings Pty Ltd v McKenzie. Senior counsel for the defendant referred to the more recent decision of Jones v Sutton (2004) 61 NSWLR 614. I am indebted to counsel for the plaintiff for providing me with written submissions in which they confirm that the better view is that there is no inconsistency between King and Mergen Holdings on the one hand and Chappell and other decisions on the other, but that if there is King did not overrule Chappell. Rather, Jones v Sutton says that King and Mergen applied the test stated in Chappell, and did so without qualification (written submissions, paragraph 12).77. Having noted this change of position by the plaintiff, I note the plaintiff accepts that the meaning of “unlikely to cause harm” means there must be “the absence of a real chance” or “the absence of real possibility of harm”. The plaintiff draws my attention to the further statements of Beazley JA at [64]-[65] where her Honour noted that the fact that the publication was sufficient to raise doubts about the plaintiff’s integrity in the mind of the person who heard the words spoken demonstrated that the publication was not such that the appellant was not likely to suffer harm.78. The plaintiff submits that in each case Mr Hasler, the recipient of the publication, has given evidence that doubts were raised in his mind about the plaintiff and these doubts recurred on each occasion. It is further submitted: 
     
     “However even without such evidence it could not be said that there was an unlikelihood of harm either to reputation or to feelings at the time of publication. There was a real likelihood of at least doubt. Further, a record by Hasler to Hennessy was at least likely and hence there was a likelihood of harm.” 
    79. The plaintiff notes at [67] in Jones there is obiter about the possibility of an exceptional case where a recipient never, as a matter of course, believed the particular maker of the statement. It is submitted that this is not such an exceptional case.80. What features of each of the publications should be taken into account in relation to the defence?81. The first is that each of these is an oral publication, published to only one person. In Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Limited [1977] 1 NSW 749 at 800 and in Chappell at 68,947 per Moffitt P, it was noted that the defence is essentially available to publications of a limited extent. The history of the section and the manner of its application could mean that visual or aural impact, and the informality of spoken language, could be relevant factors in the defence.82. A second relevant feature is the knowledge and characteristics of the recipients. This may be of particular relevance if they already knew the plaintiff’s reputation and are able to make a judgment based on their own knowledge of him or her: see Perkins v Aboriginal Land Council at 27, Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Limited at 800, Chappell v Mirror Newspapers Ltd at 68,948. Where the recipient of the publication has a close association to the plaintiff, such as the relationship between an employer or an employee, or between a company and its directors, it may be that “the defence of unlikelihood of harm (s.13) will succeed” (State Bank of New South Wales Limited v Currabubula Holdings Pty Limited and Anor [2001] NSWCA 47 at 114 per Giles JA.83. The next relevant feature is that the circumstances or occasions on which defamatory matter is published may be of significance. The references to statements made on social occasions, particularly when alcohol is consumed (see, for example, Lang v Willis), or informal conversations late in the evening (Chappell v Mirror Newspapers at 68,948) are relevant. The reference by Rich J in Lang v Willis to the “hard conditions of pioneer days” could perhaps mean the hard life on the land that farm owners arguably still lead today.84. Next, the defence may be applicable to a statement made as a rejoinder, or in a heated exchange or argument. A statement by a recipient flatly contradicting the statement may also be a factor: see Harrigan v Jones (2000) Aust Tort Rep 81-621 at 67,289 per Matthews AJ. However, some caution should be used in this regard, as the defence is not a licence to insult others in argument.85. The reputation of the defendant can be relevant, according to King v McKenzie at 311G. This would arguably be a circumstance of the publication. The publication by a person whom the recipient believes is solely motivated by jealousy, or who is regarded as beneath contempt, might be a statement which would attract the defence. However, this is a factor which should be treated cautiously, because known personal dislike is not an excuse to allow someone to freely slander another.86. As these proceedings involve a slander, I can also gain some guidance from interstate jurisdictions where the defence is available for slanders, such as the recent decision of the Court of Appeal in the Supreme Court of Queensland in Doelle v Bedey [2007] QCA 395. Keane JA, delivering the judgment of the Court, noted that the defence will apply where the circumstances render it unlikely that the defamed person will suffer harm. It may be relatively easy to make out the defence when the publication was to a small number of persons well acquainted with the plaintiff and able themselves to make a judgment of their own knowledge as to the likelihood that there was any substance in the imputation conveyed. While Keane JA’s statements in the Court of Appeal are obiter (in that publication was not able to be proved), his Honour noted that the relevant exchange came late in the course of heated and exhausting negotiations about a tenancy and that the plaintiff and defendant had had unfriendly relations and dealings for some years (at [10]). His Honour went on to note (at [11]) that the evidence which demonstrated the triviality of the appellant’s case was adduced in the appellant’s own case from witnesses actually called by him. While this is a reference to the trial judge having held the defence would be applicable despite not being pleaded, it is also an indication of what the Queensland Court of Appeal considers would amount to evidence relevant to the defence.87. It is important that I consider the circumstances of each publication carefully.Section 13 and the first publication88. Mr Campbell SC for the defendant drew to my attention the fact that no complaint was made by the plaintiff following the publication of the first matter complained of either at the time or in his letter following the second matter complained of, nor were any proceedings commenced over the first matter complained of until after my judgment of 27 September 2006. When it was pleaded, the wrong year was given, in that it was asserted that this publication occurred on 6 October 2000 when in fact Mr Hasler did not commence work for the plaintiff until October 2001.89. It is further submitted that this was a publication essentially of two words “former bankrupt” and that publication to one person was trivial in the extreme.90. However, Mr Hasler’s evidence about this first publication needs to be looked at carefully. What he told the Court at T-81 is of some importance: 
     
     “…I didn’t know Mr Hennessy until I took the position, I had two other properties under contract at the time, I met Mr Hennessy at an agent’s office and I took the position to look after the property for him and I didn’t know Mr Hennessy from a bar of soap prior to that meeting, which was only prior to me taking over the place.” 
    91. In other words, since he had only just commenced to work for Mr Hennessy. Consequently, although he said “I think I take great pride in estimating what people are like and I didn’t pay a great deal of attention”, he went on to add “I must admit you know sometimes it puts a bit of a doubt in the back of your mind if you’re going to get paid, that’s all” (T-80).92. Consequently, the first time that something was said to Mr Hasler, it did cause him some concern, because he had only just commenced working for him and did not know him.93. The following question was put to him at T-80: 
     
     “Q. On the other occasions, 14 October 2002, 18 December 2005, 27 March 2006 when Mr Lynch said to you the things you gave in evidence previously, what went through your mind, what was your reaction? 
      
     A. Well, similar, that I’d been paid by Mr Hennessy all the time right on time so it didn’t – I didn’t pay a great deal of attention to that.” 
      
    94. This tends to underline that the first publication had a degree of impact because of the special circumstances.95. The statement that Mr Hennessy was a former bankrupt to an employee who was dependent upon him for his salary, could not be a statement where the circumstances of the publication must be such that the person defamed was not likely to suffer harm. Mr Hasler said he did not know much about the plaintiff at that time; by inference, he probably knew little about the defendant either. It appears to have been one of the first conversations they ever had.96. Accordingly, applying the test set out in Jones v Sutton, no defence under s.13 is available for the first publication.Section 13 and the second publication97. The second publication occurred when the defendant was, according to the evidence of Mr Hasler, affected by alcohol. The defendant started by complaining about the plaintiff’s cattle coming onto his property and saying that the rail crossing was going to be closed. The first thing the defendant did was to insult Mr Hasler by saying to him that “You have no ethics working for Hennessy as you know he is a former bankrupt about ten years ago and you would work for Bin Laden”. Mr Hasler replied “You better watch your fucking mouth John”.98. This gives a good indication of the circumstances of publication, namely in an atmosphere of hostility and abuse of the kind referred to by Keane JA.99. The defendant went on to add, however, material of a new nature. He went on to claim that the plaintiff “got cut off” at Fish & Sons and could not get an accountant with Alan Wilding, asked was this because he did not pay his bills on time and asked “where does he deal now”? Mr Hasler said “It is none of your frigging business”.100. The defendant was providing information which went further than the first publication. True it is Mr Hasler stated categorically he knew that the statement about Alan Wilding was false because there had never been an account with Alan Wilding. True it is that Mr Hasler knew the true circumstances of any problems at Fish & Sons (which, if there were any, have been lost in the mists of time). However, it is not a question of looking at the actual facts, but of the circumstances of the publication, as the Court of Appeal noted in Jones v Sutton. Those circumstances are that two men were having an argument in which one of them was well affected by alcohol and being abusive. While that will go some way towards establishing a s.13 defence, the fact remains that imputations were conveyed that the plaintiff was not merely a former bankrupt but was currently bankrupt, that he was not creditworthy and did not pay his accounts on time. Applying the test set out in Jones v Sutton, the quality of the circumstances of the publication cannot render it unlikely that the plaintiff would suffer harm.The third publication101. The third publication is another argument between Mr Hasler and the defendant. The defendant said that he and his solicitor had measured the easements where the new yards were and that as the new yards were four feet over the easement line they had to be moved. Mr Hasler said “I have no intentions of moving the yards and you can get stuffed”.102. It is apparent from this language that the circumstances of the publication are quite different. Mr Hasler has gone from saying that the plaintiff’s private business is none of his concern, or saying to the plaintiff that the plaintiff’s activities are none of his business to telling the plaintiff to get stuffed, and saying that he does not know what he is talking about. Every word said by Mr Hasler in the course of this third publication is confrontational. Once again, before the defendant starts insulting the plaintiff, he insults Mr Hasler by claiming that he has bankrupted three people he has worked for, and Mr Hasler replies in terms of one provoked.103. The imputation is yet another statement that the plaintiff is a former bankrupt.104. In addition, when he had the third discussion with the defendant, it was clear to Mr Hasler that the defendant was intoxicated (T-82). It was put to him that he placed no weight at all on what he was saying then. He went on to say at T-83: 
     
     “I did place a bit of weight – it always comes up in the back of your mind when somebody says something that because of me [sic] dealings with Mr Hennessy, he’d always paid me, so it sort of went out of the back of my mind, because I’d always been happy with how I’d been paid, so I had no reason to worry”. 
    105. By this time Mr Hasler had been employed by the plaintiff for nearly five years. While he refused to agree with the contention that he didn’t take anything that was said seriously, he clearly had an argument on the telephone, in a conversation which he himself terminated, and it is clear from what was said and from the circumstances of the conversation that there was an unlikelihood of harm. This was a spray of abuse from the defendant directed not only at the plaintiff but also Mr Hasler. It was another drunken telephone call from the defendant.106. Having regard to the test set out in Jones v Sutton, I am satisfied that this is a case where, in relation to this publication, there was the absence of a real chance or possibility of harm. Accordingly, the defence under s.13 will succeed in relation to this publication.The fourth publication107. The fourth publication is particularly unpleasant. The defendant, who appears once again to have been drunk, immediately opened the conversation by insulting Mr Hasler as well as the plaintiff and saying he was a former bankrupt. He then repeated that the plaintiff had been cut off at Sid Newhams and Fish & Sons. He then threatened to impound some of the plaintiff’s cattle. Finally, he threatened to leave the gates open on the property, a serious threat in the country, so it is not surprising that Mr Hasler said “John I take that as a personal fucking threat”.108. Mr Hasler again hung up on the defendant and when the defendant rang back a further five times refused to take his call.109. This is very much a borderline case. The circumstances of the publication are such that the ordinary reasonable listener is more likely to think less of the defendant than to think less of either the plaintiff or Mr Hasler. Nevertheless, it goes beyond mere drunken abuse, as the jury finding of defamatory meanings shows, and the circumstances in which imputations about the plaintiff’s lack of creditworthiness were raised are matters indicating that there was a likelihood of harm.110. Accordingly, applying the test in Jones v Sutton, the defence fails for the fourth publication.Damages111. The plaintiff has succeeded in relation to the first, second and fourth publications. I shall assess damages for each of the publications. I shall also set out the sum I would have awarded for the third publication.112. Section 46A Defamation Act 1974 provides that when awarding damages, the Court is to ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the relevant harm and the amount of damages awarded. When considering general damages, the Court is to take into account damages for non-economic loss in personal injury awards in the State, including any awards made under any statute where the amount of non-economic loss is regulated by a “cap”.113. The manner in which s.46A(2) should be applied is explained by the High Court in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 327. In unanimously overturning a decision of the Court of Appeal of New South Wales, which had held, inter alia, that the plaintiff was entitled only to damages of $75,000, the High Court restored the trial judge’s award of $250,000 as well as setting aside the Court of Appeal’s findings on liability.114. In the course of restoring the verdict for $250,000 the High Court indicated the importance of a person’s reputation which in the case of a professional man such as the plaintiff in these proceedings could be “his whole life” (Crampton v Nugawela (1996) 41 NSWLR 176 at 193).115. The three purposes of an award of damages for defamation are consolation for the personal distress and hurt, reparation for the harm done to personal reputation and vindication: see Rogers at [60] per Hayne J.116. The plaintiff has drawn my attention to John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd and Another v Gacic and Others(2007) 235 ALR 402 as to business defamation and reputation (written submissions, paragraph 2). However, there is nothing in this decision about assessment of damages, and the statement of claim does not plead that any of the matters complained of was a business libel.117. The plaintiff in written submissions submits that anyone who suffers a serious libel is “prima facie entitled to substantial damages” (paragraph 3, written submissions), referring me to English and Scottish Co-operative Mortgage and Investment Society Ltd v Odhams Press Ltd [1940] KB 440 per Goddard LJ at 461. However, older English decisions such as this must be read in light of the statutory framework of the Defamation Act 1974 and, in particular, to the provisions of s.46A.118. The plaintiff has drawn my attention to a series of decisions such as Crampton v Nugawela (award of $600,000), Markovic v White [2004] NSWSC 37 ($100,000) and Zaia v Chibo [2005] NSWSC 917 ($175,000) and David v Chibo [2006] NSWSC 1257 ($217,000).119. The difficulty with these cases is that even though some of them deal with restricted publications, such as the twenty-two persons to whom the matter complained of was published in Nugawela, none of them relate to a case where there is publication to only one person. 120. The plaintiff also referred me to Monti-Haitsma Enterprises Pty Ltd v Lord (New South Wales Court of Appeal, 12 May 1988, unreported) where a verdict of $112,000 was considered excessive and the Court, with the consent of the parties, reduced the judgment to $50,000.This is a much more appropriate case in my view, but it still predates s.46A.121. However, comparison to other defamation cases, while of assistance, is arguably only relevant to s.46A(1), which requires the Court to “ensure that there is an appropriate and rational relationship between the relevant harm and the amount of damages awarded”. In determining the amount of damages for non-economic loss to be awarded the Court is also to take into consideration “the general range of damages for non-economic loss in personal injury awards in the State”.122. The Court of Appeal in John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v O’Shane (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 291 re-assessed damages in a defamation case. Young CJ in equity noted at [38]-[39] that, despite s.46A being in force for ten years, there did not appear to have been any substantial brake placed on large awards of damages. This is an important concern and I have taken it into account. Giles JA (at [3]) noted, however, that the law should place a high value upon reputation and, in particular, upon the reputation of those whose work and life depends upon their honesty, integrity and judgment. These factors are also important, and I have given these statements of principle great weight.123. However, as John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v O’Shane makes clear, this exercise does not require the trial judge to recite a string of awards of damages in personal injury cases and a demonstration of precisely how these were taken into consideration in assessing the damages: see also Moit v Bristow [2005] NSWCA 322.124. Although the plaintiff, in written submissions, submits that the imputations in question amount to “a serious libel”, imputations as to insolvency or credit would probably fall at the bottom of the range. Gatley on Libel and Slander, 10th edition at paragraph 2.21 notes that while it is true of every householder on most days of the month to say that he owes somebody money, although an allegation that a person is insolvent or will not pay his debts is defamatory.125. The level of moral opprobrium likely to be felt by the ordinary right-thinking member of the community about a person who is a bankrupt or a former bankrupt, or who has not paid his debts is likely to be less than allegations of dishonesty or professional incompetence. There has been some debate (at least in texts on defamation) about the circumstances in which such allegations can have a defamatory meaning. In the present case we have the benefit of the jury finding as to defamatory meaning, but that defamatory meaning needs to be seen in a realistic and commonsense way, having regard to the community values that would determine whether or not the publication of such an imputation amounted to a serious slander or not.126. In addition to the question of the seriousness of the imputation, there is the very real difficulty of the limited extent of the publication. I should have regard to recent judgments in the New South Wales Court of Appeal concerning publications limited to one or more recipients. In Zarth v Williamson and Ors [2006] NSWCA 246 the Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal and dismissed an appeal from judgments ranging between $2,500 and $30,000 (totalling $80,000) for three plaintiffs where there were publications, including an oral publication to a receptionist, of an extremely limited nature to only a handful of people.127. In Jones v Sutton (No 2) [2005] NSWCA 203 the Court of Appeal, although noting there was no appeal from an assessment of damages of $1,000 for each of two publications to one person and $3,000 for publication to three persons, nevertheless indicated, in obiter, that these were appropriate in the circumstances.128. In Jones v Sutton a significant part of the case was the claim of “grapevine effect” and evidence was called from witnesses who had heard the matter complained of on the grapevine. The plaintiff in these proceedings, Mr Hennessy, has not brought a claim of “grapevine effect”. Although there is a claim for hurt to feelings arising from fear of repetition, to which I shall shortly turn, the reality is that in the six years since the first matter complained of was published, no evidentiary basis for the plaintiff’s fears. Indeed, the likelihood is that since these statements are bound up with the defendant’s hostility not only to the plaintiff but to Mr Hasler, and had been said on occasions (in three of the cases) when the defendant was affected by alcohol, repetition when the defendant is talking to other persons, and is sober, may be unlikely.129. Although the plaintiff did not plead the “grapevine effect”, a significant claim was made for hurt to feelings and anxiety on the basis of fear of repetition. I shall now set out the submissions in detail. It is submitted that this was a natural and understandable concern and worry for the plaintiff particularly in light of the repetitions that have been found by the jury to have taken place. It is part of the natural “pain of mind” which accompanies such publications (Rigby v Mirror Newspapers (1963) 64 SR (NSW) 34). Hayne J in Rogers v Nationwide News Pty Limited (2003) 216 CLR 327 at [69] stated:  
     
     “Two of the three purposes served by an award of damages for defamation are to provide consolation to the person defamed for the  
     personal 
      distress and hurt which has been done, and reparation for the harm done to  
     that 
      person’s reputation. Necessarily, then, the amount awarded for defamation should reflect the effects which the particular defamation had on the individual plaintiff. It follows that the drawing of direct comparison between particular cases is apt to mislead, just as the drawing of direct comparisons in personal injury cases can also mislead. Comparison assumes that there is sufficient identity between the effect which each defamation had on the particular plaintiff, whereas in fact circumstances alter cases. The amount allowed in each case should reflect the subjective effect of the defamation on the plaintiff.” 
    130. I accept the plaintiff’s contention that fear by the plaintiff of repetition by the defendant is part of the subjective worry and stress which should be taken into account in the award.  
     
      
    131. Hayne J further states at [73]: 
     
     “It is of the first importance to recall the fundamental principle that the damages to be awarded for defamation must compensate for the effect of the defamation on the  
     particular 
      plaintiff.” 
    132. Again at [80]: 
     
     “It was well open to the trial judge to conclude that the effect of that publication on  
     this 
      appellant is very large.” 
    133. At [82]: 
     
     “Where, as is the case with both defamation and personal injury, so much turns on the effect of the wrong on the  
     particular 
      plaintiff, the drawing of such comparisons has obvious difficulty. But more than that, it revealed that any comparison which is drawn must look to the particular plaintiff, not what others may have thought of the defamatory words that were published or what kind of physical injury was sustained.” 
    134. In Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1993) 178 CLR 44 at 70 Brennan J stated that: 
     
     “Other heads of damage are compensation for the external consequences produced by the publication of the defamation and ‘a solatium’ for the plaintiff’s internal hurt, that is, for the complex of the actions that the plaintiff has experienced as a result of the publication and its external consequences.” 
    135. At 71: 
     
     “Damages are awarded also for the plaintiff’s injured feelings, including the hurt, anxiety, loss of self-esteem, the sense of indignity and the sense of outrage felt by the plaintiff. Indeed, all those objective consequences and those subjective reactions which flow naturally from publication of the defamatory matter are relevant factors.” 
    136. At 104 McHugh stated: 
     
     “The damage which a defamation produces is ordinarily psychological rather than material. It affects the feelings, sense of security, sense of esteem and self-perceptions of the person defamed. As a natural consequence, a defamation excites the anger and resentment of the victim and often enough generates a desire for retribution … … If an award of damages in a defamation action is to fulfil its social purpose, it must be high enough to assuage the hurt, indignation and desire for retribution which the plaintiff feels.” 
    137. It is submitted that consolation damages can, and in this case, should take into account the requirement to assuage a person who has a fear of repetition. Jones v Sutton at [79] stated: 
     
     “The appellant was also entitled to be compensated for the risk of repetition.” 
    138. If a risk of repetition can be the subject of compensation it is submitted that a fear of repetition can and should be taken into account when assessing the component of consolation damages.139. The plaintiff’s fear of repetition needs to be seen in context. It is a fear which over the years has not become reality. A fear of repetition, with no evidence over a period of years, starts to look fanciful. A plaintiff may have hurt feelings as a result of fear of repetition of the publication, but this is not an invitation to hysteria.140. A plaintiff who brings a claim for defamation, like a plaintiff who brings a claim for damages for personal injury, gives evidence of the hurt and injury suffered. However, in assessing that evidence, I must see it in the context of the occasion or occasions of publication of the defamatory imputations, the extent of publication, the seriousness of the imputations and the warnings and directions given by the New South Wales Court of Appeal about the correct manner in which to interpret evidence by plaintiffs of subjective opinions about the degree of injury suffered. In particular, I should have regard to a number of issues raised in the present case in cross-examination of the plaintiff where the plaintiff’s claim of hurt to feelings and of personal violation were subject to scrutiny in cross-examination.141. This brings me to a consideration of the plaintiff’s evidence on hurt to feelings generally.142. I set out in the course of the summary of evidence above a number of the statements made by the plaintiff about his hurt to feelings. On two occasions he told the Court he felt he had been “violated”. His language in relation to his reaction to these publications was dramatic and his demeanour in the witness box when speaking these words was similarly dramatic. He was angry that the defendant had defended the case, that a local solicitor named Mr Higgins had acted for him, and that Mr Campbell SC and Mr Weaver had appeared in the matter as barristers, and he said so on several occasions.143. When considering the rational relationship between the harm as required by s.46A and the awards made in personal injury cases, it is helpful to note the importance of not merely accepting a statement by a plaintiff as to the degree of hurt to feelings, or pain and suffering (in the case of a personal injury claim) but to look at it objectively on the evidence in the manner advised by the Court of Appeal in The Nominal Defendant v Kostic [2007] NSWCA 14 and Goodrich Aerospace Pty Ltd v Arsic [2006] NSWCA 187.144. While the plaintiff expressed his hurt to feelings strongly from the witness box, in practical terms it was apparent from his attacks on the defendant’s legal representatives, from his conduct towards Mr Fish and his conduct of other contentious matters, such as the breakdown of his relationship with his former partner, that he is a man who does not brook opposition lightly. He was upset by the defendant’s conduct because the defendant, having been sent a letter, had made the allegations again, and I have set out above the portion of transcript in which the plaintiff made this clear.145. It is illuminating that the plaintiff’s wife was completely unaware that her husband’s business had broken down. This is not to criticise the plaintiff, but it is an indication of his ability to put aside what must have been pressing business concerns, that he was able to conduct the entirety of the breakdown of his business partnership without even telling his wife about it.146. Hurt to feelings is a very difficult matter for any trial judge to measure. However, I have had the benefit of seeing the plaintiff in the witness box and hearing him answer questions. I have seen the anger on his face when he addressed Mr Campbell SC. He clearly is very upset about these publications, but they need to be seen in the history of the extremely poor relationship between the plaintiff and defendant going back to the earliest days of their relationship. I find that his anger with the defendant relates to other matters in which the statements forming the cause of action in these proceedings play only a part.147. Accordingly, when considering the hurt to feelings of the plaintiff, I am of the view that there is a degree of exaggeration in his claim that he has felt “violated” by these publications and by the cross-examination of Mr Campbell SC. Mitigation of damages148. Senior counsel for the defendant put a number of matters to me in mitigation. The first is the delay in commencing proceedings over the first and second publications, asserted to have occurred in 2000 (in fact in 2001) and 2002.149. A letter requesting an apology was sent in relation to the second publication, and claims of delay in relation to this publication are understandable. However, the first publication was not the subject of proceedings until after my judgment of September 2006. That tends to suggest that any hurt to feelings caused by this publication was minimal. I have taken this into account in relation to the first publication.150. Secondly, senior counsel for the defendant submitted to me that these were slanders to one person and that the recipient of the slander fell within the exception referred to in Jones v Sutton. I do not accept this submission. The fact that Mr Hasler knew the truth did not stop there being a doubt in his mind, as he said in his evidence. However, with all due respect to Mr Hasler’s evidence, any doubts he had were largely being laid aside by the time of the third publication and the fourth publication, as can be seen by his reports to the plaintiff that the defendant was “at it again”.151. In practical terms, there are few mitigating circumstances for these publications. I now turn to a consideration of the claims for aggravated compensatory damages.Aggravated compensatory damages152. The plaintiff brings a claim for aggravated compensatory damages in relation to the following matters: 
     
     (a) the defendant failed to make any or any proper enquiries as to the truth of the matters complained of; 
      
     (b) the defendant gave the plaintiff no forewarning of the allegations he was about to make and gave no opportunity for the plaintiff to rebut them; 
      
     (c) the falsity of the imputations; 
      
     (d) the defendant’s failure to offer an apology; 
      
     (e) the matters complained of were published with malice and with the express purpose of causing damage and loss to the plaintiff. 
    153. In addition, the conduct of the trial and the pleading (and discarding) of a defence of partial justification are relied upon. I shall deal with each of these in turn.Failure to make proper enquiries154. Failure to enquire may be due to negligence, but such failure may also be evidence of recklessness, especially enquiry would have nailed the lie: Andrew v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd [1980] 2 NSWLR 225.155. Cases about failure to enquire tend to relate to written publications rather than to words spoken in anger on in the course of a dispute: David Simon Co v Mather [1977] VR 516. In Kiam v Neill [1996] EMLR 493 (CA) the Court considered the defendant acted irresponsibly by failing to check the accuracy of a serious charge of insolvency against a prominent businessman.156. The defendant’s failure to enquire was foolish, especially after he was put on notice by the plaintiff’s solicitor’s letter, as to the later publications, that any such claim was false.157. Recklessness in publication, if it has affected the plaintiff, may aggravate the damages (Andrews at 244 per Hutley JA). The failure of the defendant to make proper enquiries in relation to the fourth publication is of greater significance because he had been told in relation to the second publication that what he was saying was false.158. However, in relation to the first and second publication, the failure to enquire would carry less weight. An obligation to enquire into everything one hears in daily life, including rumours circulating throughout the community, is not an expectation that the Courts should lightly impose. Consequently, while of significance for the fourth publication, this is not an issue of significance for the other publications.Failure to give forewarning159. Again, this is a particular more routinely given in relation to written publication rather than words spoken in anger. It is difficult to see what obligation the defendant would have had to give a warning that he was going to say something bad about the plaintiff. In my view, this is not an appropriate matter for aggravation of damages in relation to any of the publications.Falsity of the imputations160. I have heard Mr Fish’s evidence in relation to this issue. In my view, it should be given limited weight at best. While it would appear that the plaintiff was in fact (rightly or wrongly) refused credit on one occasion and later terminated his account with Fish & Sons, that is no justification for the publication of imputations of bankruptcy or denial of credit at other premises. Accordingly, the evidence of lack of falsity of the imputations should be given only limited impact.161. There is no doubt that the imputations in relation to being a bankrupt and a former bankrupt were false. The hurt to the plaintiff’s feelings was increased by reason of this falsity. Accordingly, this is an appropriate matter for aggravated compensatory damages.Failure to offer an apology162. No apology was ever sought for the first publication and the first publication is not referred to in the letter following the second publication.163. In Jones v Sutton (No 2) the Court of Appeal emphasised the need for an apology to be a genuine request. The language in which the apology was couched warned of proceedings being commenced and is minatory in terms. It was nevertheless a warning to the defendant and he appears to have behaved himself for three years thereafter. He may not have apologised, but he appears to have refrained from offending again until the two occasions of the third and fourth publications when, as was the case with the second publication, he had been drinking and was arguing with Mr Hasler.164. No apology was ever sought for the third and fourth publications; instead, proceedings were commenced. This is perhaps unfortunate, as perhaps a reminder letter from the plaintiff's solicitors might have obviated the need for these proceedings.165. The failure to offer an apology following the second publication in my view ought to apply mainly to the second publication, but the defendant could have apologised, even though no further apology was sought, at any time for any of the publications. The period of time and the circumstances of the publication of the third and fourth matter complained of need to be taken into account in assessing whether it is appropriate to regard it as conduct warranting the award of aggravated compensatory damages for repetitions of a libel when the falsity of the libel has been drawn to the attention of the defendant. It is my view that any claim for failure to apologise should accordingly be restricted to the second publication, notwithstanding the fact that there are two further publications following this request.166. It was open to the defendant to apologise for the other publications after commencement of proceedings. He did not do so, and this is a relevant factor to take into account on the issue of aggravated as well as general compensatory damages.Publication of the matters complained of with malice167. Malice or vindictiveness may be a basis for the award of aggravated compensatory damages. The decisions need to be read with some caution, because in some jurisdictions, such as Canada, malice is a pre-requisite for the award of aggravated damages: Hill v Church of Scientology of Toronto (1995) 184 NR 1 (SCC), whereas Australian courts have taken the view that where punitive damages are not permitted by statute (as is the case in New South Wales) malice is not relevant to the assessment of aggravated damages except insofar as the malice affects the harm suffered by the plaintiff: Carson v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1993) 113 ALR 577; s.46A Defamation Act 1974. In addition, there is a requirement that the plaintiff be aware of the defendant’s state of mind: Waterhouse v Broadcasting Station 2GB Pty Ltd [1985] 1 NSW 58.168. It is clear from the facts in this case that the plaintiff and defendant detested each other. Prior hostility and ill will is evidence of malice. There is evidence of malice in relation to each publication.Filing and then withdrawing a defence of truth; conduct of the litigation169. Filing a defence of truth recklessly will inflame the damages: Herald and Weekly Times Ltd v McGregor (1928) 41 CLR 254 at 262. Withdrawing the defence does not cure the problem. Conduct of the litigation, including excessive or prolix cross-examination, can be evidence relied upon for aggravation of damages.170. The filing of a defence of partial justification in these proceedings was foolish, because the truth of these lesser imputations would never outweigh imputations of bankruptcy. There was, however, some evidence of the truth of the imputations about Fish & Sons, in that Mr Hasler agreed that the imputation about Fish & Sons was true. Again, while that may be an appropriate matter to raise in relation to a claim for aggravated compensatory damages, it did not warrant the filing of a defence of truth. This is an appropriate ground for claiming aggravated damages.171. The conduct of the litigation (excluding the filing of the justification defence) is a more difficult issue. The law concerning whether a claim of aggravated damages entitles a defendant to lead evidence of falsity is settled. I note that in Elliott v The Age Company Ltd [2006] VSC 52 appears to be in contradiction to the explanation of s.47 by McHugh J in Singleton and Anor v Ffrench (1986) 5 NSWLR. Nevertheless, the defendant is entitled to lead such evidence.172. Courts have always been slow to draw inferences from the conduct of proceedings by counsel. Litigation is by definition adversarial in nature in our legal system and parties should be entitled to put and plead their cases without fear of additional claims for damages. Only when a party has crossed the line in some way should such a claim be considered. 173. The conduct of this case by the solicitors and barristers retained on behalf of the defendant has been entirely proper and, in my view, does not warrant any claim for aggravated compensatory damages.Conclusion concerning damages174. I have had regard to the principles of law and the evidence in this case referred to above. I have given particular weight to the competing considerations referred to by Young A-JA and Giles JA in Bristow v Moit. I have also had regard to recent appellate decisions concerning the extent of damages to be awarded in publications of a limited nature.175. Defamation actions about publications to one person only are very rare. In the present case, all four publications were made to the same person, over a period of some years. Three of them occurred in circumstances where the defendant was affected by alcohol and was insulting the recipient of the publication as well as the plaintiff. I appreciate that the plaintiff is upset by these publications, but they must, on any fair minded and objective analysis of the facts in this case, fall at the bottom of the range of damages, particularly when having regard to the comparative degree of seriousness of these imputations.176. Accordingly, it is my view that the assessment of damages should be as follows: 
     
     (a) The first publication 
      – Taking into account the long period of delay prior to commencement of these proceedings and the other factors referred to above, and considering the publication was a few words giving rise to a single imputation, this is an appropriate matter for an award within the range referred to by the Court of Appeal in  
     Jones v Sutton (No 2) 
      and, accordingly, I award $1,000. 
      
       
      
     (b) The second publication 
      – This is a more serious publication in that it contains a number of imputations. In addition, there are aggravating features of a more considerable nature than the first publication. Taking all of the above factors and the circumstances of publication into account, I award $5,000. 
      
      
     (c) The third publication 
      – I have found for the defendant in relation to this publication but I consider, particularly taking into account the three year gap and the circumstances of the defendant’s intoxication and bad language on both sides, that the damages for this imputation would fall at the bottom of the range and, if I were to award damages, I would have awarded damages in the sum of $1,000. 
      
      
     (d) The fourth publication 
      – This is the most serious publication. There are quite substantial aggravating features, including the repetition of the libel in circumstances where the defendant had been put on notice as to the falsity of the imputations and where (unlike the third publication) there was no provocation. The presence of a number of aggravating features would put the damages towards the top end of the range for a publication to one person of imputations of this level of seriousness and I award the plaintiff damages in the sum of $10,000. 
    Interest177. The parties have liberty to bring in short minutes of order reflecting mathematically agreed sums for the calculation of interest.Costs178. The plaintiff has succeeded in three out of four of the publications. The parties may wish to raise some of the costs issues discussed by the Court of Appeal in Jones v Sutton. The defendant’s senior counsel indicated as much in the course of submissions. It is my view that it is preferable for me to make no order for costs for the time being, but to reserve costs, in anticipation of receiving submissions from both parties on this issue. For me to express a provisional view may be considered to be a prejudgment of the matter in circumstances where I have not given both parties adequate notice of my findings and listened carefully to their submissions in relation thereto.Orders(1) Judgment for the plaintiff in relation to the first publication (on or about 6 October 2001) in the sum of $1,000.(2) Judgment for the plaintiff on the second publication (on or about 14 October 2002) in the sum of $5,000.(3) Judgment for the defendant in relation to the third publication (on or about 18 December 2005).(4) Judgment for the plaintiff in relation to the fourth publication (27 March 2006) in the sum of $10,000.(5) Parties have liberty to bring in short minutes of order containing the mathematically agreed interest payable on the judgment of $16,000.(6) Issues of costs reserved, and the parties to have liberty to apply.(7) Exhibits remain with the file for 28 days.

     PARKER v COMPTROLLER-GENERAL OF CUSTOMS 
      
      
     Headnote 
      
    From 1987 to 1989, officers of the Australian Customs Service conducted an investigation in relation to suspected breaches of the Spirits Act 1906 (Cth) and the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The suspected breaches involved certain importers of brandy who had been “extending” the product with locally produced grain-based alcohol on which duty had not been paid. Three main businesses were believed to be involved in the scheme: Lawpark Pty Ltd, an importer and distributor of spirits; Kingswood Distillery Pty Ltd, a maker and processor of spirits; and Breven Pty Ltd, the operator of a bond store at which imported spirits were warehoused. The Appellant, Mr Parker, was a director and shareholder of Lawpark Pty Ltd and Breven Pty Ltd.In March 1990, customs officers attended a number of premises and requested the production of books and documents in relation to the scheme. On forming the view that there had been a failure to comply with the request, the customs officers executed search warrants issued under the Customs Act. Subsequently, the Appellant, amongst others, was charged and convicted of 14 offences under ss 33 and 234 of the Customs Act.The Appellant sought to have certain documents excluded pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). The documents had been seized pursuant to a warrant issued under s 214 of the Customs Act. The Appellant argued that both the issue of the warrant and its execution were either unlawful or improper. A voir dire was conducted and Simpson J gave judgment ruling that the evidence should be admitted. The Appellant was convicted, largely on the basis of an analysis of the seized documents. The present appeal is brought from the interlocutory judgment of Simpson J.On appeal, the issues for determination were:(i) the jurisdiction of the Court in relation to an appeal from a customs prosecution;(ii) the scope of the search powers pursuant to execution of a warrant under s 214 of the Customs Act;(iii) the extent of the improper or unlawful conduct; and(iv) whether the primary judge properly exercised her discretion to admit the evidence.The Court held, dismissing the appeal(per Basten JA, Mason P and Tobias JA agreeing)In relation to (i)1. Under State law, rights of civil appeal are identified not by the nature of the order but by the manner of instituting proceedings, pursuant to the exclusions contained in the Third Schedule of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). As the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) requires that proceedings be commenced by civil process, the right of appeal will arise under the Supreme Court Act: [38].

    2. The appeal was properly instituted in the Court of Appeal: [39].In relation to (ii)3. Subsection 214(3) of the Customs Act is not restricted to the goods the subject of the written information but includes the goods imported or exported during the previous five years: [49].In the matter of O’Neill (NSWDC, 18 August 1988, unrep), not followed.In relation to (iii)4. The primary consideration in deciding upon the admissibility of unlawfully or improperly obtained evidence is whether there has been deliberate disregard for the law as opposed to an accidental or inadvertent contravention: [59]. 
    Bunning v Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54, applied.5. Where the impropriety arises from inadvertence or mistake, the higher the probative value of the evidence and the greater the seriousness of the crime, the greater the public interest in its admission. The weight to be given to these considerations cannot be resolved in the abstract but depends upon the circumstances of the case and the interplay between the different factors: [62]6. It was open to the trial judge to reject the suggestion that there was any dishonourable or dishonest motive on the part of Customs in deciding to pursue the investigation through s 214 of the Customs Act: [76]. There is no basis for holding that reliance on s 214 was inconsistent with advice received from counsel, or that such advice was ignored by Customs: [71].7. The Appellant failed to establish that the purpose of the request for notices was not to obtain the production of documents but to trigger the entitlement to execute the warrant, being an improper purpose: [89].8. The notice to produce documents was insufficiently precise in its identification of the goods in question. The notice was invalid and purported reliance on it engaged s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW): [90].9. Whether there has been a failure to comply with a request to produce documents depends upon whether a reasonable time has been allowed for compliance: [94].

    10. On the basis of the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to find that Mr Parker had failed to comply with the notice in the sense that he had demonstrated no willingness to produce and hand over all of the documents required by the notice: [107].11. There was no deliberate or reckless disregard of an established constraint on the power of Customs officers in executing a warrant. Customs did not act improperly in failing to instruct its officers to adhere to a narrow view of their powers under s 214 of the Customs Act: [118].In relation to (iv)12. In the circumstances, the weighing exercise required under s 138 of the Evidence Act to determine whether evidence should be admitted turned on whether the actions of the Customs officers could properly be described as involving a wilful disregard of legal constraints imposed on their powers: [121].13. The Appellant failed to establish any wilful disregard for the law, dishonest motive or improper purpose on the part of Customs: [123]-[124]. Nor was any error established in the reasons provided by the primary judge with respect to the balancing exercise required by s 138(3) of the Evidence Act: [127].IN THE SUPREME COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESCOURT OF APPEAL

    2 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Basten JA. 
     
      
    3 BASTEN JA: Over a period covering 1987-1989 officers in the Australian Customs Service conducted an extensive investigation in relation to suspected breaches of the Spirits Act 1906 (Cth) and the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). The officers came to the view that certain importers of brandy, prior to bottling and sale, had been contaminating or “extending” the product with locally produced grain-based alcohol on which duty had not been paid. The scheme was understood to involve three main businesses. Lawpark Pty Ltd (“Lawpark”) imported and distributed spirits. Kingswood Distillery Pty Ltd was a maker and processor of spirits in Australia. Breven Pty Ltd (“Breven”) operated a bond store at which imported spirits could be warehoused without incurring a liability to pay duty. The present Appellant, Mr Stephen Parker, was a director and shareholder of both Lawpark and Breven. 
     
      
    4 By March 1990, customs officers had formed the view that all of the bottled stock which had been tested and contained “extended” spirit, came from the bond store operated by Breven. On 6 March 1990 officers attended at a number of premises, requested the production of books and documents and, on forming the view that there had been a failure to comply with the request, executed search warrants issued under the Customs Act. An analysis of documents produced as a result of these searches led to charges being laid under the Customs Act against, amongst others, the present Appellant. 
     
      
    5 Proceedings commenced in 1992 in the Common Law Division against Mr Parker and others laid charges of offences under the Customs Act involving the evasion of duty in an amount exceeding $3 million. The charges relating to Mr Parker came on for trial before Simpson J in April 2005 and, in a judgment dated 8 May 2006, Mr Parker was convicted of 14 offences under ss 33 and 234 of the Customs Act: Comptroller-General of Customs v Parker [2006] NSWSC 390. 
     
      
    6 Mr Parker appealed against his convictions on numerous grounds, but by the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, the scope of the challenges had been drastically reduced. The grounds which were pressed were restricted to the admission of company records seized from Lawpark on 6 March 1990. The records were seized pursuant to a warrant issued under s 214 of the Customs Act. Both the issue of the warrant and its execution were said to be either unlawful or attended by impropriety. Accordingly, the Appellant sought to have the documents obtained in the execution of the warrant excluded by the trial judge pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW).  
     
      
    7 A voir dire was conducted over five days in April 2005, at the conclusion of which her Honour ruled that the evidence should be admitted and the hearing proceeded. Her reasons for so ruling were delivered in a separate judgment of 8 May 2006: Comptroller-General of Customs v Parker [2006] NSWSC 387. It is from that interlocutory judgment that the present appeal is brought. 
     
      
    8 The delay in this matter reaching a trial in the Supreme Court appears to have arisen from a stay being ordered on 10 June 1994 in the Common Law Division for reasons which were described by the trial judge as “not apparent, and no longer relevant”: [2006] NSWSC 390 at [54]. Over the years that have elapsed there have been significant changes to the law. For example, the Spirits Act 1906, in relation to possible contraventions of which the investigation was undertaken, has long since been repealed, as have the provisions of the Customs Act under which the warrant was issued and the search conducted. In relation to the circumstances surrounding the issue of the warrant, the request for production of documents and the execution of the warrant, the relevant law to be discussed below was that in force in March 1990. The Evidence Act, under which questions of admission of evidence arose, was enacted after the commencement of the proceedings, but before the trial. Key laws relating to the jurisdiction of this Court have, fortunately, not changed between the date of commencement of proceedings in the Common Law Division in 1992 and the date of the appeal.

      Jurisdictional and procedural issues 
      
    10 Neither the notice of appeal nor the pre-hearing written submissions considered the source of this Court’s jurisdiction. A question was raised by the Court at the commencement of the hearing as to whether the proceedings should properly have been brought in the Court of Criminal Appeal. Submissions were subsequently made in relation to this question, both parties contending that this Court had jurisdiction, but agreeing to the necessary steps to have the matter disposed of by a Court of Criminal Appeal constituted by the same bench, should that prove necessary. 
     
      
    11 It was not in dispute that the present proceedings were “Customs prosecutions” for the purposes of Part XIV of the Customs Act: see s 244. The proceedings were instituted by the Comptroller in the Supreme Court, as allowed by s 245(1)(a). This provision constitutes a law of the Parliament investing the Supreme Court with federal jurisdiction, pursuant to s 77(iii) of the Constitution. The jurisdiction of this Court for the purposes of an appeal must be identified in a law of the Commonwealth which either expressly confers that jurisdiction or applies the relevant laws of the State in that respect: see, eg, the general provisions in ss 68, 79, 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). 
     
      
    12 Before considering the operation of such general provisions, it is necessary to consider the specific provisions of the Customs Act. Thus, s 247 of the Customs Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Prosecutions in accordance with practice rules 
        
       
       
        
        247 Every Customs prosecution in a court referred to in subsection 245(1) may be commenced prosecuted and proceeded with in accordance with any rules of practice (if any) established by the Court for Crown suits in revenue matters or in accordance with the usual practice and procedure of the Court in civil cases or in accordance with the directions of the Court or a Judge.” 
        
       
      
    13 This provision does not in terms deal with rights of appeal. The words “commenced prosecuted and proceeded with” are apt to cover a trial. There being no rules of practice in respect of Crown suits in revenue matters in the Supreme Court, the practice and procedure of the Court in “civil cases” would apply. This provision may operate differentially in relation to particular issues. Thus, it does not invoke rules relating to the burden of proof in civil cases: see Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Labrador Liquor Wholesale Pty Ltd (2003) 216 CLR 161. 
     
      
    14 Section 248 makes further provision in relation to matters of practice: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        State Court practice 
        
       
       
        
        248 Subject to the provisions of this Act the provisions of the law relating to summary proceedings in force in the State or Territory where the proceedings are instituted shall apply to all Customs prosecutions before a Court of summary jurisdiction in a State or Territory, and an appeal shall lie from any conviction order for condemnation or order of dismissal to the Court and in the manner provided by the law of the State or Territory where such conviction or order is made for appeals from convictions or orders of dismissal, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the law of the State or Territory, an appeal shall lie from an order of dismissal to any court to which and in the manner in which an appeal lies from a conviction.” 
        
       
      
    15 Although the opening words of s 248 invite attention to other provisions of the Customs Act, there are none of consequence for present purposes, with the possible exception of s 247. Thus, to the extent that s 248 purports to pick up “provisions of the law relating to summary proceedings” in force in a State, it may not be effective to pick up procedure in criminal cases inconsistently with the mandate of s 247. However, it is clear from the composite effect of the opening lines of s 248 that it intends to refer to summary proceedings “before a Court of summary jurisdiction” in the particular State. The term “summary jurisdiction”, at least in the context of criminal proceedings, is usually intended to identify a jurisdiction in relation to indictable offences where a trial is to be conducted otherwise than before a judge and jury. The Supreme Court in this State now exercises summary jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 4, Part 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW). However, the fact that s 245(1) distinguishes in par (a) (referring to the Supreme Court of a State) and par (f) (referring to “a Court of summary jurisdiction of a State”) between superior courts and courts of summary jurisdiction indicates that s 248, at least in its first limb, was not intended to apply to the exercise of summary jurisdiction by the Supreme Court. (There appears to be no particular consistency in the manner in which these provisions refer to “Court” and “court”.) Further support for this view may be obtained from s 26 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) which defines “Court of summary jurisdiction” to mean “any justice or justices of the peace or other magistrate … of a State or part of a State … sitting as a court … for the making of summary orders or the summary punishment of offences …”. 
     
      
    16 The next question is whether the reference in the second part of s 248 to “an appeal” from “any conviction” is to be understood as limited to the preceding subject matter, namely proceedings in courts of summary jurisdiction, or whether it should be understood to refer to convictions in proceedings brought in any court. 
     
      
    17 If s 247 applies to every court referred to in s 245(1), the purpose of the first limb of s 248 is obscure. An alternative view is that s 247 applies to superior courts, whereas s 248 was intended to apply to courts of summary jurisdiction. The Comptroller-General noted that that approach accorded with Wollaston’s, (HNP Wollaston, Customs Law of Australia (1904) William Brooks & Co, at pp 161-163). That is true: however, Wollaston was writing at a time when s 247 was expressly limited to Customs prosecutions “in the High Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of any State”. Wollaston was correct when he wrote. Provision for prosecution in the High Court was not removed from sections 245 and 247 until the Jurisdiction of Courts (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1979 (Cth). After that amendment, section 247 was limited to proceedings in a Supreme Court. The variation of section 247 by omitting reference to a Supreme Court and substituting “court referred to in subsection 245(1)” was only effected by the Customs and Excise Amendment Act 1982 (Cth), s 62. No amendment was made to s 248 and the consequence for that provision of the amendment to s 247 may not have been appreciated. However, the result with respect to s 247 is that it now appears to prescribe the procedure to be adopted in a Customs prosecution in all courts: see Labrador Liquor, [27] (Gummow J). 
     
      
    18 The historical coverage of s 248 is more obscure. In 1901 s 245 identified three courts or categories of court in which proceedings might be brought, namely the High Court (par (a)), the Supreme Court of a State (par (b)), or “any County Court, District Court, Local Court or Court of summary jurisdiction”: (par (c)). Section 248, as enacted, picked up the law relating to summary proceedings “before Justices” which was referable to Courts of summary jurisdiction, but would appear not to have applied to a County Court or District Court. Whatever the resolution of that apparent anomaly, the second limb of s 248 has at all stages referred to appeals “in the manner provided by the law of the State”. It would have been inapt for that provision to apply to the High Court, or indeed to the Supreme Court if it were intended thereby to pick up rights of appeal to the High Court, not being a matter dealt with by the law of a State. Nevertheless, the fact that there are on any view anomalies removes some of the force from the contention that the second limb of s 248 must be intended to be limited to the subject matter of the first limb. Rather, it seems likely that it was intended to apply to proceedings brought in the County Court or District Court or a Local Court, as well as a Court of summary jurisdiction, for otherwise there would have been no provision in 1901 permitting an appeal by any party from an order of those Courts. 
     
      
    19 The interrelationship of ss 247 and 248 in their current form was discussed by the Queensland Court of Appeal in Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Powell [2007] QCA 106 (McMurdo P, Holmes JA and Chesterman J). After a careful consideration of the legislative history of the provisions, including the explanatory memorandum for the 1982 amendments, the Court concluded that at least where proceedings were commenced in a Court of summary jurisdiction, the first limb of s 248 permitted proceedings to be commenced either in accordance with the civil rules or with the rules for criminal offences dealt with in its summary jurisdiction: at [14]-[19]. Their Honours concluded that the 1982 amendment was not intended to cause a drastic constriction of the operation of s 248, so as to make s 247 the sole basis upon which a Customs prosecution could be commenced in a State or Territory court. Although s 248 is required to be read subject to the provisions of the Customs Act, s 247 should not be treated as a provision giving rise to inconsistency. The submissions of the Chief Executive Officer that such provisions as s 251 (no objection for informality), s 252 (conviction not to be quashed for procedural defect or want of form), s 253 (protection to witnesses), s 254 (defendant competent witness) and s 255 (averment of prosecutor sufficient) were examples of provisions to which State summary procedure might be subject: at [10]. As their Honours recognised, this approach was contrary to the view of Gummow J in Labrador Liquor: at [19]. The issue does not need to be addressed further in the present case. 
     
      
    20 There remains a question as to whether s 248 operated with respect to appeals from convictions in the Supreme Court. If it did not, it would appear that such appeals must have been covered by s 247, because, in 1901, there was no other general law applying State laws in matters of federal jurisdiction. Prior to the statutory provisions for appeal in criminal matters, there were limited rights of challenge against conviction available under the common law: see generally Conway v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 203. It may have been assumed that such common law rights would apply in relation to a Customs prosecution brought in a State Supreme Court, whereas it was thought to be necessary to provide for the application of statutory provisions relating to appeal from Courts of summary jurisdiction, such as s 9 of the Justices Acts Amendment Act 1900 (NSW). Further, it was well-established by 1901 that the Supreme Court exercised appellate jurisdiction regulated by statute: see, eg, Supreme Court and Circuits Act 1900 (NSW), s 18. 
     
      
    21 Nor can this problem now be resolved simply by reliance upon the general provisions of the Judiciary Act. That is because they operate only to the extent that another law of the Commonwealth does not otherwise provide and because their operation does not resolve the question as to whether State laws with respect to appeals from criminal convictions or from civil judgments are applicable. 
     
      
    22 The Court’s attention was not drawn to any case in which this issue has been addressed. In Stephens v Abrahams (1902) 27 VLR 753 at 756-757, Hodges J held that an order for review available in the Supreme Court of Victoria with respect to a conviction in a Court of Petty Sessions was an “appeal” for the purposes of s 248. A similar conclusion was reached by a Full Court in this State in Ex parte Oesselmann (1902) 2 SR (NSW) 149 (Stephen, Owen and Cohen JJ) in relation to statutory prohibition in respect of a decision of justices. 
     
      
    23 In Evans v Lynch [1984] 3 NSWLR 567, this Court considered an appeal against a decision by a judge in the Common Law Division not to order that proceedings under the Customs Act be tried by a jury. It appears to have been accepted without consideration that an appeal lay in the civil jurisdiction of the Court. 
     
      
    24 More recently, there have been a number of appeals dealt with by this Court, in which comments have been made as to the appropriate characterisation of the proceedings in the Common Law Division, though not for the purposes of considering the right of appeal. Thus, in Evans v Button (1988) 13 NSWLR 57, the Court considered an appeal from a decision by the trial judge to allow an amendment of the summons in accordance with the Supreme Court Rules. Mahoney JA (Priestley and McHugh JJA agreeing) considered that, pursuant to s 247, the trial judge was correct and the appeal was dismissed. 
     
      
    25 In Jack Brabham Holdings Pty Ltd v Button (1988) 94 FLR 278 this Court (Kirby P, Mahoney and Clarke JJA) considered the proper approach to an application for a stay of proceedings on the basis that, as a result of delay, they constituted an abuse of process. All members of the Court noted the difficulty in classifying the proceedings as either civil or criminal; none addressed the question of the classification for the purposes of appeal. 
     
      
    26 Neil Pearson & Co Pty Ltd v Comptroller-General of Customs (1995) 38 NSWLR 443 was concerned with an appeal taken from the Local Court to the District Court with respect to convictions of a number of charges of evading payment of duty. Hosking DCJ in the District Court stated a case pursuant to s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for consideration of the Court of Criminal Appeal. (Although the Court is referred to as “Court of Appeal” in the heading of the report, that is clearly an error, the matter being dealt with by Kirby ACJ, Allen and Dowd JJ, sitting as the Court of Criminal Appeal.) The appropriateness of this course of appeal generally was established in Collector of Customs v Tallerman & Co Pty Ltd [1975] 2 NSWLR 832 (NSW CCA, Street CJ, Nagle and Begg JJ). 
     
      
    27 In Rowling v Murray (1993) 116 FLR 125, Debelle J in the Supreme Court of South Australia heard an appeal from a magistrate challenging the validity of an amendment in the form of an additional charge. His Honour appears to have treated the matter as controlled by s 248 of the Customs Act and applied a section of the Justices Act 1921 (SA) dealing with criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    28 In Labrador Liquor, at [114], Hayne J (in a judgment with which Gleeson CJ and McHugh J agreed) stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Arguments founded on classification of the proceedings as ‘civil’ or ‘criminal’ as determinative of the standard of proof, must fail. As reference to the historical matters mentioned earlier reveals, the classification proposed is, at best, unstable. It seeks to divide the litigious world into only two parts when, in truth, that world is more complex and varied than such a classification acknowledges.” 
        
       
      
    29 Despite the terms of s 247, the Court in Labrador Liquor unanimously held that the criminal burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt applied. However, as Hayne J also noted, where the proceedings did not seek or result in a conviction, a different approach might be required: at [135]. 
     
      
    30 While this Court has exercised jurisdiction in relation to appeals in similar proceedings on a number of occasions without comment, its judges have also sat in the Court of Criminal Appeal and exercised jurisdiction on appeal from similar proceedings in a Local Court. Although there are separate procedural provisions in ss 247 and 248, it might seem curious if appeals were to be brought in the criminal jurisdiction from a conviction in a court of summary jurisdiction, but in the civil jurisdiction where the conviction was in the Supreme Court and, possibly, in the District Court (or County Court) but only when exercising original jurisdiction. It is also curious that such a dichotomy has been accepted without comment. One possible reason for the failure of the Customs Act to make clear the nature of the appellate jurisdiction in relation to the Supreme Court may have been that, in 1901, there were no separate statutory provisions in Australia with respect to criminal appeals. 
     
      
    31 It is at least theoretically possible that two forms of appeal are available, the aggrieved party having the power to choose. However, that result would appear anomalous and was not proposed by either party in the course of argument. Furthermore, it would be inconsistent with the scheme of the Judiciary Act. Both ss 79 and 80, which provide for the application of State laws applicable in relevant proceedings, are qualified to the extent that, in the language of s 79, there must be no Commonwealth law which has “otherwise provided”. Alternative provision may be made by a Commonwealth law which expressly addresses the subject matter of the State law, or it may be made by another Commonwealth law picking up and applying a State law. Sections 79 and 80 may thus be seen as ‘back up’ provisions to ensure that there is no failure of procedural or substantive law available in the exercise of federal jurisdiction: see, eg, The Commonwealth v Mewett (1997) 191 CLR 471 at 522 (Gaudron J); and at 554 (Gummow and Kirby JJ). In the present case, that would require first the application of s 68, in relation to laws of a State respecting the procedure for the hearing and determination of appeals arising out of a summary conviction of a person charged with an offence: see s 68(1). However, the State laws will only operate “so far as they are applicable” and accordingly it is necessary to return to the proper construction of the State law which in this context, will be s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    32 If the order of the trial judge, despite involving convictions, is a civil judgment or order of the Court in a Division, the appeal will lie to this Court pursuant to s 101(1) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW), as applied in federal jurisdiction by ss 79 and 80 of the Judiciary Act. A judgment or order to which s 101 applies will not, however, include one made in proceedings specified in the Third Schedule of the Supreme Court Act. The Third Schedule excludes: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) proceedings in the Court for the prosecution of offenders on indictment (‘indictment’ including any information presented or filed as provided by law for the prosecution of offenders) including the sentencing or otherwise dealing with persons convicted.” 
        
       
      
    33 The concept of an ‘information’ in this context should be understood as extending to the means by which a public prosecution is commenced, seeking a conviction for an offence: see John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 163 CLR 508; Ove Arup Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of NSW [2006] NSWCA 28; (2006) 149 IR 193. Nevertheless, because the exclusion from civil jurisdiction effected by the Third Schedule identifies proceedings by way of the means of their commencement, it is arguable that the present proceedings, commenced by civil process, are not excluded. On the other hand, proceedings in the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court are commenced by application, rather than information: see Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 246. A conviction under Part 5 of Chapter 4 of the Criminal Procedure Act (dealing with the summary jurisdiction of Supreme Court and other higher courts) is “taken for all purposes … to be a conviction on indictment” and attracts the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal, pursuant to s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5AA Appeal in criminal cases dealt with by Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A person: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) convicted of an offence, or 
             
            (b) against whom an order to pay any costs is made, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            by the Supreme Court in its summary jurisdiction may appeal under this Act to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the conviction (including any sentence imposed) or order.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    34 Three factors militate in favour of the view that the right of appeal applicable under State law in the present case is to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The first is that, as noted above, the terms of the Judiciary Act require one to consider first laws of the State respecting the summary conviction of persons charged with offences and the hearing and determination of appeal arising out of any such trial or conviction: s 68(1). By contrast, s 79 of the Judiciary Act, which would pick up civil rights of appeal, if applicable, must give way to another Commonwealth law which otherwise provides and which would include s 68. The opening words of s 80 have a similar qualification to s 79. 
     
      
    35 Secondly, an appeal against a “conviction” naturally falls within the language of Part 3 of the Criminal Appeal Act, but would not ordinarily be seen as falling within the phrase “judgment or order” as used in s 101 of the Supreme Court Act, in relation to civil jurisdiction. 
     
      
    36 Thirdly, consistency would favour treating parties in the same way in whichever court the proceedings were commenced. If the second limb of s 248 operates at all, it would appear to pick up appeal provisions relating to criminal offences by use of the term “conviction”, at least in relation to appeals from courts of summary jurisdiction. If it applies generally, the State law with respect to appeals from convictions should be the law which would operate, either by force of s 248 itself or s 68 of the Judiciary Act. 
     
      
    37 The contrary considerations are twofold. The first is that ss 247 and 248 of the Customs Act, as originally enacted, adopted civil procedures in relation to the superior courts and provisions relating to summary proceedings (a phrase generally associated with the criminal process) in the lower courts. Thus procedural consistency was not intended and it would not be anomalous if appeal rights were to vary depending upon the court in which the proceedings were commenced. Secondly, for s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act to apply, it would be necessary to conclude that the conviction was effected by the Supreme Court “in its summary jurisdiction”. That language is apt to refer to the conferral of summary jurisdiction by s 245 of the Criminal Procedure Act. However, s 247 of the Customs Act does not (and never did) permit the commencement of proceedings in the Supreme Court under the Criminal Procedure Act (or any earlier equivalent), but rather under the civil procedures of the Supreme Court Act (and its predecessors). That, however, was not in terms part of the jurisdiction conferred on the Court of Criminal Appeal with the introduction of s 5AA by the Criminal Appeal (Crimes) Amendment Act 1979 (NSW): in relation to the legislative history of the Court’s summary jurisdiction, see Ove Arup Pty Ltd v Industrial Court of NSW [2006] NSWCA 28; (2006) 149 IR 193 at [48]-[54]. 
     
      
    38 In short, under State law, rights of civil appeal are determined not by the nature of the result (whether a conviction or other form of order) but by the manner of instituting proceedings, pursuant to the exclusions contained in the Third Schedule of the Supreme Court Act. The Customs Act requires that proceedings be commenced by civil process. It follows that, whatever the nature of the orders made in the Common Law Division, the right of appeal will arise under the Supreme Court Act. Although s 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act would in terms appear to cover the kind of orders made in the present case, it was introduced to address other circumstances and with a different jurisdiction in contemplation. 
     
      
    39 The preferable conclusion, on the materials before the Court, is that the appeal was properly instituted in this Court. That conclusion follows practice in this State as revealed in the authorities set out above. However, it is desirable to note by way of reservation that the history of the Customs Act was not fully explored in the course of argument and that neither party contended for a different result. 
     
      
       
      Issues on appeal 
      
    40 Her Honour handed down three judgments, each having the same title, the first being Comptroller-General of Customs v Parker [2006] NSWSC 387 (dealing with the admissibility of evidence following a voir dire); the second Comptroller-General of Customs v Parker [2006] NSWSC 390 (pursuant to which the Appellant was convicted) and Comptroller-General of Customs v Parker [2006] NSWSC 1269, pursuant to which her Honour imposed a penalty of 3.25 times the amount of duty evaded (being an amount a little in excess of $10 million), a penalty of $12,000 in respect of the unauthorised movement of goods and further ordered the defendant to pay the costs of the proceedings. The grounds now pressed all relate to the admissibility of the evidence (being substantially the whole of the evidence upon which the charges were prosecuted) pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW). No separate challenge was pursued in relation to the reasons for conviction or mounted in relation to the penalty, although both would properly be set aside if the evidence were held to be inadmissible. 
     
      
    41 As explained above, the charges against Mr Parker arose out of a major investigation undertaken by customs officers in relation to the “extension” of brandy. That investigation led to the issue and execution of a search warrant pursuant to s 214 of the Customs Act and the seizure of a large quantity of documents from Lawpark. The charges ultimately laid did not relate to offences under the Spirits Act 1906 (Cth) in relation to brandy, but rather 13 charges relating to evasion of duty payable under the Customs Act, and one charge of unauthorised movement of goods subject to customs control, under s 33(1) of the Customs Act. Of the 13 evasion charges, 11 involved duty in an amount of $143,259.26, another involved an amount of $90,457.95 and the final charge involved an amount of $1,447,061.70, giving a total amount of duty evaded as $3,113,371.40. The offences were committed over a period of almost three years between August 1987 and May 1990. The liquor in relation to which duty was evaded was whisky, and not the brandy the subject of the initial investigation. 
     
      
    42 The circumstances of the initial investigation are of relevance for present purposes in specific respects only. At the heart of the Appellant’s case were complaints as to the unlawfulness of the steps which preceded the request for and search and seizure of documents on 6 March 1990. In order to appreciate the nature of the improper conduct alleged and the manner in which it was dealt with by the trial judge, it is convenient to deal first with the search powers conferred by s 214 of the Customs Act; secondly with the proper approach to exclusion of evidence under s 138 of the Evidence Act; and thirdly with the factual findings and application of the principles to the relevant findings. 
     
      
       
      Search powers:  
      Customs Act 
      , s 214 
      
    43 In March 1990, both the Customs Act and the Spirits Act were administered by the Comptroller-General of Customs: see Spirits Act, s 2A. The investigation into the extension of brandy could have given rise to offences under the Spirits Act. Although there was a particular power to enter premises and take samples pursuant to s 22 of the Spirits Act, general powers of investigation were to be found in the Customs Act, the relevant Parts of which were incorporated into the Spirits Act, so far as applicable: Spirits Act, s 4. The incorporation of Parts XI-XV included Part XII (conferring powers on officers) and thus s 214 which read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Production of documents etc in cases of seizure 
        
       
       
        
        214. (1) Whenever information in writing has been given on oath to the Collector that goods have been unlawfully imported exported undervalued or entered or illegally dealt with, or that it is intended to unlawfully import export undervalue enter or illegally deal with any goods, or whenever any goods have been seized or detained, the owner shall immediately upon being required so to do by the Collector produce and hand over to him all books and documents relating to the goods so imported exported entered seized or detained undervalued or illegally dealt with, or intended to be unlawfully imported exported undervalued entered or illegally dealt with, and of all other goods imported or exported by him at any time within the period of 5 years immediately preceding such request seizure or detention, and shall also produce for the inspection of the Collector or such other officer as he may authorize for that purpose and allow such Collector or officer to make copies of or extracts from all books or documents of any kind whatsoever wherein any entry or memorandum appears in anyway relating to any such goods. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           Penalty: $1,000. 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) For the purposes of this section, the Comptroller or the Collector of Customs for a State or Territory may issue to any officer of Customs or officer of police a Customs Warrant, in accordance with the form in Schedule V, marked with a Customs stamp. 
           
           … 
           
          (3) If any person fails to comply with a requirement by the Collector under this section, an officer of Customs or officer of police, having with him a Customs Warrant in the form of Schedule V hereto, may, at any time of the day or night, break open and enter into any house, premises or place in which any books or documents relating to the goods are or are supposed to be, and search: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           (a) the house, premises or place; 
            
           (b) any person therein or thereon; and 
            
           (c) any chests, trunks or packages therein or thereon; 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           and take possession of, remove and impound any of those books and documents which are found.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    44 The first step envisaged by s 214 is the provision of information on oath to the Collector. That officer is defined as “any principal officer of Customs”: s 8(1). The information must relate to some unlawful dealing with goods. The goods and the dealing may be assumed, for present purposes, to refer to such goods and dealings as are dealt with under the Customs Act or the Spirits Act. 
     
      
    45 The second step involves a requirement by the Collector that “the owner” produce and hand over books and documents. The term “owner” in respect of goods is broadly defined to include any person “being or holding himself out to be the owner, importer, exporter, consignee, agent, or person possessed of, or beneficially interested in, or having any control of, or power of disposition over the goods”: s 4. There is no power of delegation in relation to functions of the Collector, so that any requirement made by the Collector of an owner, if not made by the Collector in person, must be made in writing. The Regulations provide for a form of “notice to produce documents under section 214”: Customs Regulations, reg 171. The form of the notice recited the information in writing, or the seizure of goods and stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, therefore, I, the Collector of Customs for the State of , by virtue of the powers conferred upon me by the  
        Customs Act 1901 
        , do hereby require you to produce and hand over to an officer of Customs duly authorized by me on my behalf to receive the same, all books and documents relating to such goods and relating to all other goods imported ( 
        or 
         exported) by you at any time within the period of five years immediately preceding this request, and I further require you to produce for the inspection of the said an officer of Customs duly authorized by me for that purpose or such other Officer as I may authorize for the purpose, and allow such Officer to make copies of or extracts from all books or documents of any kind whatsoever wherein any entry or memorandum appears in any way relating to any such goods.” 
        
       
      
    46 The obligation of the owner required by the Collector to produce and hand over books and documents was to comply “immediately” with the requirement. A failure to comply triggered the power of the officer to execute a customs warrant in accordance with sub-s 214(3). The form of that warrant, found in Schedule V to the Act, recited the giving of information on oath or the seizure of goods and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “You are hereby authorized, in the event of failing to comply immediately with any requirement made in pursuance of section two hundred and fourteen of the  
        Customs Act 1901-1923 
        , to enter into, at any time of the day or night, and search, any house premises or place in which any books or documents relating to the goods are or are supposed to be; and to break open any such house premises or place and search any person therein or thereon and any chests trunks or packages therein or thereon; and to take possession of, remove and impound any of those books and documents which are found: And for so doing this shall be your sufficient warrant.” 
        
       
      
    47 Despite changes in the structure, the Schedule V warrant replicates the powers set out in sub-s 214(3). The powers of search and removal are restricted to “any books or documents relating to the goods”, language which may also be found in s 214(1). However, the words “the goods” appear in four passages in sub-s (1). In the first, the word “goods” are limited to those that have been or are intended to be unlawfully dealt with or seized or detained. This may be identified as the introductory part of the provision. The first operative part, applying to books and documents, is the obligation to produce and hand over books and documents “relating to the goods” which, in its context, is clearly a reference back to the goods which have been the subject of written information or have been seized or detained. The second operative provision appears to pick up another category of books and documents relating to (although the connector is “of”) “all other goods imported or exported by him at any time within the period of five years immediately preceding such request seizure or detention”. These, it seems, are colloquially referred to as the ‘five year documents’ but might more accurately be referred to as documents relating to ‘the five year goods’. 
     
      
    48 There then follows a third category of documents “wherein any entry or memorandum appears in any way relating to any such goods”. The third category appears to envisage a distinction between documents relating to goods and those documents in which an entry or memorandum appears, where the entry or memorandum relates to the goods. (This differentiation was explicit and must have been intentional or the third category of documents would merge into the first.) Books and documents falling into the third category are to be produced for inspection, copying or the preparation of extracts, but, in contra-distinction to the first two categories, are not required to be handed over. The question is whether the reference to “any such goods” in relation to the third category refers only to the goods which were the subject of the written information, or includes the goods imported or exported during the previous five years. The structure of the section, together with the broad language, indicates that both the goods the subject of the written information and the five year goods were intended to be included in the phrase “any such goods”. 
     
      
    49 Subsection (3) is in more confined terms. As already noted, it addresses books or documents “relating to” the goods. To the extent that sub-s (1) distinguishes between books and documents “relating to” goods and those containing entries or memoranda relating to goods, it is the former and not the latter which may be the subject of a customs warrant. However, that does not resolve the question as to whether the warrant is restricted to the goods identified in the written information or extends to all other goods imported or exported within the five year period. One possible point of distinction between the first and second categories of documents identified in sub-s (1) is that the former involves documents relating to the goods identified in the information whereas the second category appears, grammatically, to refer to documents “of” all other goods. This change in terminology is curious, but should not be understood as creating some different category of books and documents. However, once it is accepted that the subject matter of the requirement under sub-s (1) is books and documents relating to one of two categories of goods, it is difficult to see why the reference to books and documents relating to “the goods” in sub-s (3) should not relate to all of the documents (by reference to both categories of goods) identified in sub-s (1). To divide the documents into two categories would have curious results. Thus, an owner who handed over documents relating to the goods referred in the written information, but refused to provide further documents, would fail to comply with the requirement in sub-s (1), thus triggering the right to execute a warrant under sub-s (3). The purpose of sub-s (3) is to ensure that, absent voluntary compliance, the warrant will permit a search by officers to obtain books or documents falling within the requirement which have not been supplied. To construe the category of books and documents in sub-s (3) as more limited than the books and documents referred to in sub-s (1) would be to defeat the purpose of sub-s (3) in circumstances where only a handful of the documents the subject of the requirement had been provided, but sub-s (3) was found to be restricted to that very handful. 
     
      
    50 A different view was taken by Dunford DCJ in In the matter of O’Neill (NSWDC, 18 August 1988, unrep). His Honour held that the only documents which could be seized under the warrant were those relating to the goods which were the subject of the written information: Judgment, p 12. In reaching that conclusion, his Honour expressly adverted to the construction of s 214, set out above, recognising that the argument appeared “valid”: Judgment, p 11. He also accepted that to adopt the more limited construction of s 214(3) suggested “an absurdity”: p 12. However, he thought the alternative construction was compelled by the form of the warrant prescribed by sub-s 214(2) and Schedule V. The form of the warrant requires express reference in its recital to the goods the subject of the written information or which have been seized or detained. Where, in the operative part of the warrant, reference is made to searching the house in which any “books or documents relating to the goods” are supposed to be and taking “those books and documents”, his Honour considered that the reference to documents relating to “the” goods must have been a reference to the goods identified in the recital to the warrant. 
     
      
    51 The force of that argument may be conceded: nevertheless, the warrant also refers to failure to comply with “any requirement” made pursuant to s 214. That requirement would involve documents relating to two categories of goods, namely the goods identified in the written information and all other goods imported or exported within the preceding five years. Although the warrant, in its recital, referred to the justification for the requirement (sometimes colloquially identified as the ‘notice to produce’) it also expressly identified the failure to comply with the requirement as the factor which triggered the obligation under the warrant. That requirement, as already noted, extended to documents relating not only to goods the subject of the written information, but to all goods imported or exported during the preceding five years. The recipient of the warrant would have been conscious of the scope of the requirement and hence the categories of the goods to which the documents sought related. No doubt the warrant could have set out the terms of the requirement in full and thus achieved greater certainty in the terms of its authority. However, the failure to expand the document in that manner does not justify the imposition of an anomalous constraint on the scope of the statute. Nor, as a matter of practical reality, should the recipient of the warrant expect that the warrant would be more limited than the requirement to produce and handover documents, with which he or she has immediately previously failed to comply. 
     
      
    52 The result of this construction is that there is a lacuna in relation to the enforcement mechanism with respect to the third category. However, that category did not involve documents “relating to” any goods, but only documents containing entries or memoranda relating to the goods. The Collector was in any event given more limited powers in relation to those documents. Subsection (3) was confined to documents which could be taken possession of, removed and impounded, in accordance with the requirement under sub-s (1) and did not extend to documents which could only be inspected and copied. In that sense it may be said that a failure to comply with the requirement under sub-s (1) might trigger the execution of a warrant, despite the fact that all the documents relating to the goods had been produced, with the result that nothing further would be seized under the warrant. However, that minor anomaly, if it be seen as such, would not justify the creation, without any substantial justification, of the far greater anomaly of excluding what are likely to be the major part of the documents relating to goods which were required to be produced and handed over under sub-s (1). If the searcher were entitled to inspect and copy documents in the third category, no anomaly would arise. 
     
      
    53 As will be noted below, the trial judge accepted the conclusion reached by Dunford DCJ in O’Neill: [2006] NSWSC 387 at [24], [25] and [39]. In my view that construction was mistaken. 
     
      
       
      Exclusion of evidence:  
      Evidence Act 
      , s 138 
      
    54 Before considering further the factual circumstances relevant to the appeal, it is convenient to consider the basis on which it was sought to exclude the documentary evidence obtained by execution of the warrant. That was sought pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act, which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        138 Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) Evidence that was obtained: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    55 One difficulty in the construction of s 138(1) is the distinction between conduct which is improper and conduct which is unlawful. Apart from some possible variation in the closeness of the causal connection, there does not appear to be any significant distinction between evidence obtained in contravention of an Australian law and evidence obtained in consequence of a contravention of an Australian law, being the second limbs of pars (a) and (b) respectively. The same intention should be attributed to the first limb of each paragraph, so that there is no significant difference between obtaining evidence improperly and obtaining evidence in consequence of an impropriety. The real issue is to identify the scope of an impropriety which will result in the qualified exclusion of evidence where there has been no unlawfulness, in the sense of a contravention of an Australian law. Putting aside confessional evidence, which is dealt with in sub-s 138(2), the best known example of improper conduct, not amounting to unlawfulness, is the action of an agent provocateur or person who induces another to commit a crime through subterfuge or trickery. This situation was discussed in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 and, for the purposes of s 138, in Robinson v Woolworths Ltd (2005) 64 NSWLR 612 at [16]-[38]. 
     
      
    56 There may be circumstances in which it is not the commission of the crime itself, but the obtaining of evidence of an antecedent crime which is attended by trickery or deception, not amounting to a contravention of a legal prohibition. For example, a police officer may induce the occupant of premises to allow a search to be undertaken voluntarily, in the false belief, induced by the officer, that he or she had a warrant which could be relied upon if consent were not forthcoming. Improper conduct may also occur in circumstances where a police officer has a warrant and seeks to exercise a search based on its authority, knowing that the warrant was for some reason invalid. One can envisage variations on the theme: the warrant may in fact have been invalid for reasons which the police should have been aware of, but were not. The warrant may in fact have been valid, but was believed by the officers to be invalid. Further consideration of such examples need not be pursued in the circumstances of this case. 
     
      
    57 The exercise of the discretionary power conferred by this provision involves two steps. The first is to determine whether evidence sought to be adduced was in fact obtained improperly or unlawfully in one of the senses identified in pars (a) and (b). The second step is to consider whether despite that conclusion, the discretionary considerations favour its admission. The importance of giving appropriate weight to the effect of any impropriety or unlawfulness is reflected by means of a qualified proscription – the evidence “is not to be admitted unless”. In carrying out the balancing exercise, the Court is required to take into account the factors identified in sub-s (3) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence; and 
           
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding; and  
           
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject matter of the proceeding; and 
           
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention; and 
           
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless; and 
           
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the  
          International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 
          ; and 
           
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention; and 
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    58 Other factors, relevant to the circumstances of the case, may be taken into account, but the listed considerations are mandatory. No guidance is given in the section as to how the particular matters are expected to affect the outcome. It is clear from the Law Reform Commission report on which the legislation was based that both the policy and the language were derived in significant part from the joint judgment of Stephen and Aickin JJ in Bunning v Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54 at 74-80: Australian Law Reform Commission, Report No 26 (Interim) Evidence, pars 958-964. Their Honours identified the issue as involving two competing requirements of public policy and the need “to resolve the apparent conflict between the desirable goal of bringing to conviction the wrongdoer and the undesirable effect of curial approval, or even encouragement, being given to the unlawful conduct of those whose task it is to enforce the law”: at 74. Often the unlawful conduct involves the collection of evidence in contravention of constraints deliberately imposed by the legislature to protect human rights and freedoms. Their Honours noted at 77-78: 
     
      
       
        
        “These safeguards the executive and, of course, the police forces, should not be free to disregard. Were there to occur wholesale and deliberate disregard of these safeguards its toleration by the courts would result in the effective abrogation of the legislature’s safeguards of individual liberties, subordinating it to the executive arm.” 
        
       
      
    59 In considering the circumstances before them in Bunning v Cross, which involved the admissibility of the results of a breathalyser test where the statutory preconditions for undertaking the test had not been met, their Honours identified the primary consideration as whether the police officers had acted in deliberate disregard of the law or rather as the result of an honest but mistaken belief: at 78. Their Honours noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although such errors are not to be encouraged by the courts they are relatively remote from the real evil, a deliberate or reckless disregard of the law by those whose duty it is to enforce it.” 
        
       
      
    60 This factor is reflected in paragraphs (d), (e) and (f) of s 138(3). Accordingly, a deliberate or reckless disregard of legal constraints, involving a contravention of an internationally recognised human right or fundamental freedom, will undoubtedly weigh against admission. On the other hand, if the contravention were accidental or inadvertent and involved no serious contravention of an internationally recognised right, that would tend in favour of admission. 
     
      
    61 Paragraph (h), concerning the ease with which the evidence might have been obtained without contravening a legal protection, was treated in Bunning v Cross as a third consideration, but is closely related to the first, their Honours stating (at 79): 
     
      
       
        
        “A deliberate ‘cutting of corners’ would tend against the admissibility of evidence illegally obtained. However, in the circumstances of the present case, the fact that the appellant was unlawfully required to do what the police could easily have lawfully required him to do, had they troubled to administer an ‘alcotest’ at the roadside, has little significance.” 
        
       
       
      As in  
      Bunning 
      , it is likely that this factor will often be treated as either neutral or equivocal. 
       
      
    62 The second consideration identified in Bunning v Cross was the effect of the illegality on the cogency of the evidence. This factor does not find explicit recognition in s 138(3), but may be understood as part of the assessment required under pars (a) and (b) of the probative value of the evidence and its importance in the proceedings. The Law Reform Commission, following Stephen and Aickin JJ, noted that the public interest in admitting evidence where other evidence untainted by impropriety is available is weaker than may be the case where there is no untainted evidence. However, the analysis by the Commission in relation to probative value generally, is that the higher the probative value of the evidence the greater the public interest in its admission, in the interests of accurate fact-finding: Report, Vol 1, par 964. However, Stephen and Aickin JJ adopted a somewhat different approach, stating at p 79: 
     
      
       
        
        “To treat cogency of evidence as a factor favouring admission, where the illegality in obtaining it has been either deliberate or reckless, may serve to foster the quite erroneous view that if such evidence be but damning enough that will of itself suffice to atone for the illegality involved in procuring it. For this reason cogency should, generally, be allowed to play no part in the exercise of discretion where the illegality involved in procuring it is intentional or reckless. … 
        
       
       
        
        Where, as here, the illegality arises only from mistake, and is neither deliberate nor reckless, cogency is one of the factors to which regard should be had.” 
        
       
      
    63 The weight to be given to these considerations cannot be resolved in the abstract and is likely to depend not only on the circumstances of the case but on the interplay between the different factors. Thus, the subject matter of the proceeding, identified in par (c), will provide both an independent and a comparative element. As an independent element, as the Commission noted, there is a greater public interest in convicting of a serious crime than of a lesser crime: see also R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284; (2002) 132 A Crim R 169. In the comparative sense, it allows for the nature of the alleged wrongdoing to be weighed against the unlawfulness of the conduct involved in obtaining the evidence: see Bunning v Cross, p 80. Thus the probative value of the evidence and its importance in the proceeding (pars (a) and (b)) if high in each case, combined with a serious criminal offence (par (c)), may militate strongly in favour of admission, particularly if combined with an affirmative finding as to the difficulty of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of the law (par (h)). 
     
      
    64 Paragraph (g) concerns possible disciplinary or other action in relation to the misconduct in obtaining evidence. If a police officer is likely to be disciplined for the impropriety, it may be thought that the “sanction” of excluding the evidence is unnecessary; on the other hand, there may be some incongruity in convicting a person of a criminal offence on the basis of evidence where a disciplinary or even criminal process has been invoked against the officer responsible for obtaining it. Further, it will not always be possible to know whether disciplinary proceedings are likely to be taken: such steps may deliberately have been left until after any criminal proceedings have been completed, so as not to prejudice their outcome. Clear findings in a judgment of contravention of a relevant law may lead to disciplinary proceedings against the offending officer, whether or not the evidence was excluded. No reliance was placed on paragraph (g) in the present case and it need not be considered further. 
     
      
    65 What can be said without equivocation is that obtaining evidence in deliberate, wilful or even reckless disregard of an individual’s civil rights is likely to be a strong factor against the exercise of the discretion to admit the evidence. 
     
      
       
      Exclusion of evidence: factual findings 
      
    66 Against these general comments, it is convenient to turn to the circumstances in which it is contended that s 138 was engaged. They may be addressed chronologically. 
     
      
       
      (a) Decision to pursue investigation through s 214 
      
    67 The first basis of impropriety alleged by the Appellant was the choice of s 214 as the preferred method of obtaining documents from the Appellant, rather than proceeding under s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and obtaining a search warrant for particular documents or things. 
     
      
    68 The availability of an alternative power may well have been relevant to the difficulty or ease with which the evidence could have been obtained without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law for the purposes of s 138(3)(h). However, the existence of an alternative procedure does not of itself demonstrate impropriety in the adoption of the chosen procedure: c.f. Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Gunner (1998) 84 FCR 400, 407-408. The initial question must therefore be whether the procedure chosen was in fact available in the circumstances. The complaint made at this stage is not that it was unavailable, but that Customs had available to it legal advice that it was unavailable. There was thus impropriety, so it was contended, in relying upon a statutory power which, absent contrary advice, should have been understood to be unavailable. 
     
      
    69 The legal advice, dated 27 October 1989, was obtained by the Collector of Customs for the State of New South Wales, in relation to the operation of Kingswood Distillery Pty Ltd (“Kingswood”). As the advice noted, the suspected offences involved claims by Kingswood, thought to be false, as to the volume of spirit which it purchased and subjected to a process of methylation, as a result of which the spirit ceased to be dutiable. The Collector and his officers had reason to believe that the spirit so treated was sold to Breven which used it to “extend” brandy, as described above. In that context, counsel expressed the view that s 214 did not extend to unlawful activities in contravention of the Excise Act. While he specifically referred to the manner in which s 4 of the Spirits Act 1906 picked up particular provisions of the Customs Act, including s 214, and noted the possibility of an offence against s 9(1)(b) of the Spirits Act, he concluded that, on the instructions available to him, it was not possible to say whether there had been a contravention of s 9(1)(b), which required that activities be undertaken in relation to interstate trade and commerce. However, he concluded that “in so far as it is possible to establish an offence under the provisions of the Spirits Act the Collector would be authorised to issue a notice under section 214 by virtue of the provisions of section 4 of the Spirits Act … . The effect of a provision such as section 4 is that the incorporated statutory provisions are treated as being set out in full in the incorporating Act …. Standing in the Spirits Act, the expression ‘illegally deal with’ in s 214 is apt to include dealing with the goods contrary to the provisions of that Act”. 
     
      
    70 On 16 January 1990, a customs officer swore a document providing information to the effect that two bottles of “Cheval Napoleon old French brandy” bearing a label “Imported by Lawpark Pty Ltd” had been purchased in Richlands, Queensland. Chemical analysis demonstrated that the spirit within the bottle included spirit produced from grain or molasses and that the bottle was therefore incorrectly labelled as “brandy”. A contravention of s 9(1)(b) of the Spirits Act was alleged. 
     
      
    71 On the basis of that information, reliance upon s 214 of the Customs Act was entirely consistent with counsel’s advice. Whether he was correct in thinking that s 214 did not extend to a breach of the Excise Act was, in the circumstances, beside the point. The basis for saying that Customs ignored counsel’s advice is therefore not apparent. Any complaint of impropriety on this basis should have been rejected. 
     
      
    72 The trial judge expressed the following view in relation to counsel’s advice: 
     
      
       
        
        “30. Relevantly, the gist of the advice was that an illegality against the  
        Spirits Act 
         would not suffice to permit the use of a Notice to Produce under s 214(1). For present purposes it is unnecessary to explore his reasoning. His advice was given in strong terms, as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘So doubtful is it in my mind that s 214 can in the last resort assist the Collector that it seems to me that the only safe course, that would enable the Collector to obtain documents from the relevant parties before they could be destroyed without substantial doubts as to the legality of his actions, would be to obtain a search warrant under the provisions of s 10 of the  
            Crimes Act 
             …’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        31. It appeared, on the present hearing, to be common ground that this opinion was incorrect. For my part, I can see no reason why an illegality under the  
        Spirits Act 
         would not constitute an illegal dealing for the purposes of s 214. However, it is not necessary to resolve that question.” 
        
       
      
    73 With respect, neither limb of this approach should be accepted. First, the advice clearly envisaged that s 214 would be available on facts which supported suspicion of an offence under the Spirits Act. The information which would support such an offence was apparently not provided to counsel and was only reduced to a sworn instrument on 16 January 1990, well after counsel gave his advice. As explained above, counsel expressly envisaged the use of s 214 where the circumstances established an offence under the Spirits Act. Secondly, it was important, for the purposes of the voir dire to resolve, if not the correctness of the opinion, at least the legality of the reliance on s 214. The Appellant’s position, as explained in this Court, was not that the opinion was incorrect, but that its correctness was immaterial. However, it was not possible properly to apply s 138(3) of the Evidence Act, and in particular consider the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, until it had been established whether there was a mere impropriety or whether there was unlawful conduct, and if unlawful, in what respects. 
     
      
    74 In the course of the voir dire, the Appellant engaged in extensive examination of various customs officers, for the apparent purpose of establishing that counsel’s advice had not been provided to the Collector of Customs for New South Wales before he signed the written request for production of books and documents and before he signed the customs warrant. However, the sting in this attack really depended upon the power being unavailable and being known to be unavailable to responsible officers who then deliberately or recklessly failed to advise their superiors. If the power was in fact available, the complaint that they failed to pass on incorrect advice to the contrary would have lost much of its sting. If the power were available and the advice which was not passed on was to that effect, the whole basis of this challenge disappeared and the extensive cross-examination about the internal processes within the Customs bureaucracy was, to that extent, misconceived and inappropriate. 
     
      
    75 To take an example, the former Collector of Customs for New South Wales, Mr Keith Stilling, was cross-examined at some length on 12 April 2005 in relation to the issue of the documents. He had retired in 1993 and had almost no recollection of the events which had occurred 15 years earlier: Tcpt, p 74(3) and 75(5). Mr Stilling was asked to read counsel’s advice and in particular the passage set out by her Honour at [30], repeated above. He was then asked to confirm, on the basis of that paragraph, that had he read it prior to signing the customs warrant under s 214 in March 1990, he would not have signed the document: Tcpt, pp 77(40)-(55) and 78(30)-(40). 
     
      
    76 The trial judge held that it would quite obviously have been “better” had counsel’s advice been disclosed to Mr Stilling before he signed the instruments: at [35]. However, as her Honour also noted, if the failure to draw the advice to Mr Stilling’s attention was partly caused by the “serious and well-founded doubts about its accuracy” the force of the complaint was, as her Honour held, much diminished. It was open to her Honour, on her understanding of the advice and the evidence given, to reject the suggestion that there was “any dishonourable or dishonest motive on the part of any officer”: at [35]. If the advice were both correct and, when read as a whole, supportive of the course taken by Customs, the scope for any dishonourable or dishonest motive effectively disappears. The Appellant’s case in this respect depended upon selective extracts from contemporaneous documents which, when read in context, provided no basis for the suggested impropriety or unlawful behaviour. 
     
      
       
      (b) Issue of notices: improper purpose 
      
    77 Assuming that the procedures under s 214 were available in the circumstances of the case, the Appellant then challenged the issue of the notices on the basis that the purpose of the request or requirement was not to obtain the production of documents, but rather to trigger the entitlement to execute the warrant. This challenge was linked, in a practical sense, with the complaint that the request having been made, insufficient time was allowed for compliance and that non-compliance was assumed in circumstances where it had not occurred. 
     
      
    78 For the purposes of this argument, the Appellant accepted that customs officers were of the view that their powers of search under the warrant were co-extensive with the obligation to produce documents pursuant to a request or requirement of the Collector. Whether that view was correct or not was not in issue for the purpose of this challenge. 
     
      
    79 Some time was spent in cross-examining customs officers, seeking concessions that they believed it would be beneficial to their purposes if the requests for production were not complied with, so that the warrants could be executed. Some support for the view that such a belief was extant was sought to be obtained from memoranda and file notes prepared by Peter Swinton, a principal legal officer with the Australian Government Solicitor.  
     
      
    80 The first document, dated 31 January 1990, was a file note of an attendance on Jeffrey Locker who was the NSW Director of Investigations within Customs. The passage relied upon stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “They are going to do it over at the end of month on basis of the use of the Interstate Spirits Act breach/s214 Notice. He asked whether a night raid would be preferable but said they have 15 houses they want to raid so had decided on a 9am kick-off so they won’t have to get people up in their pyjamas.” 
        
       
      
    81 On 5 February 1990, Mr Swinton made an attendance note in relation to the same matter, although there is no record of the person or persons with whom he spoke. The substance of the note, as it appeared in evidence, was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Excisable goods are used to extend. (Records) Want to grab all those excisable documents. 
        
       
       
        
        Need to use circumstantial evidence: too many caps, labels, cartons and packaging would like to take all those records. 
        
       
       
        
        (Would not) evidence of bottles purchased for the packaging of imported goods be records of imported goods? The basis for an s214 Notice is that imported goods are extended with local product.” 
        
       
      
    82 Those documents provide no support for any improper purpose. They were notes of on-going discussions between Mr Swinton and customs officers which also covered technical difficulties of reliance upon copies of warrants sent by facsimile. Other legal problems were addressed over the ensuing days. A key file note relied upon by the Appellant was that prepared on 26 February 1990 of a conference with Mr Mutton, Senior Inspector, Investigations and Mr Benson, Chief Inspector, Investigations. Part of the conversation related to the ability to execute a warrant at premises other than those to which the notice related. Mr Swinton’s note recorded under the “Schedule V warrants on non-compliance”: 
     
      
       
        
        “I said: if you go to Kingswood on s214, and non-compliance warrant invoked at Kingswood, can go at any place. (Based on AGS Adelaide opinion.) Ron [Benson] said AGS Adelaide had said you could go to any place suspected. I agree at first sight. But no good if compliance is given and that’s part of the problem. I suggested extra 214 Notices be kept in reserve and used if and only if compliance given.” 
        
       
      
    83 If one leaves out the last sentence of that extract (as did the Appellant’s written submissions) there might be an inference drawn that compliance with a request to produce documents would create a “problem”: however, read in context, it appears that the perceived problem was the ability to search premises other than the premises at which there had been compliance.  
     
      
    84 On 27 February 1990 Mr Swinton had another conversation with Mr Benson at which various problems relating to the statute under which the relevant offences might have arisen and the extent to which one company or person was an agent of another, were discussed. A passage at the foot of the file note, read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Notice to Produce and s214  
        doesn’t 
         ask them, however, to produce all docs relating to goods ‘illegally dealt with’. I said that’s because it’s seeking a total admission thereby – who could comply. Unfortunately he says it could be answered, in absence of importing business, by docs relating to 20% of one 750 ml bottle!!” 
        
       
      
    85 The thrust of this discussion appears to have been a concern on the part of Mr Benson that the request itself did not require the owner of the goods to identify all documents revealing illegal dealings. Mr Swinton provided a lawyer’s explanation. The view expressed by Mr Benson that the notice could be complied with by producing documents in relation to the contents of one bottle was misconceived, for two reasons. The first (which constitutes another part of the Appellant’s case) was the difficulty in identifying the particular bottle. The second was that he ignored the obligation to produce documents relating to goods dealt with during the previous five years. By itself, it is difficult to see any inference of an improper purpose being drawn from this record. Rather, what is conveyed by the file notes as a whole is a picture of customs officers faced with a legally and factually complex situation seeking to resolve a range of potential difficulties with their solicitor. 
     
      
    86 What further assistance could be obtained from the oral evidence of the solicitor, Mr Swinton, was somewhat unclear, but significant reliance was placed on it for the purposes of the appeal and in particular the cross-examination on 13 April 2005 at Tcpt 169-178. At p 170(45) the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now, would it be fair to say that Customs’ desire in these kinds of cases was such that it preferred non-compliance so that it could exercise the warrant and send in its officers to search for the documents which it believed would assist its case? 
         
        A. I can’t be sure exactly what they want, but I can see that would be of advantage to them.” 
        
       
      
    87 There was further questioning along similar lines, in the course of which Mr Swinton said that he could not recall the events without reference to his notes; that he could not now understand his notes in part; that his recollection of the understanding of the scope of a request under s 214(1) appeared to be incorrect; and, consistently over several attempts to obtain a different answer, that he did not know what Mr Benson and Mr Mutton were thinking. 
     
      
    88 The Appellant also relied upon the cross-examination of Mr Locker, the State Director of Investigations, on 14 April 2005, Tcpt, pp 276-277. The submission that “the cross-examination proceeded on the basis that the wide forensic powers afforded by the warrants constituted an advantage” is correct, as was the assumption that there needed to be non-compliance with the request before the warrant could be executed. However, unless the cross-examiner obtained some form of useful concession from the witness, the basis upon which the questions were put is a matter of no relevance. Her Honour was entitled to ignore it. 
     
      
    89 The Appellant took issue with her Honour’s comment: 
     
      
       
        
        “The point of this was that it was suggested that they had engineered non-compliance with the Notice to Produce in order to enliven the warrant powers. As I have indicated, I see no benefit such as to motivate any of the officers to take this course.” 
        
       
       
      As her Honour also noted, “[n]o such advantage was elicited during the course of the extensive cross-examination of all officers”: at [37]. On the basis that the scope of the request and the extent of the search permitted by the warrant were co-extensive in respect of the documents sought, her Honour’s comment is understandable. If there were voluntary compliance, the officers would obtain all the documents which they would be entitled to obtain by way of search (and, in relation to the third category, possibly more). If they believed there had not been full compliance, they would no doubt search for documents not produced. There might of course be a circumstance in which there was the appearance of compliance, but they entertained doubts. In such a situation there might be a desire to carry out a search to check whether there had been compliance, but an inability to do so because they were unable to be satisfied to the appropriate degree that there had been non-compliance. However, that does not appear to have been the point of the cross-examination, or the Appellant’s submissions. No further enlightenment is to be achieved by referring to the pages in the cross-examination of Mr Mutton (Senior Inspector, Investigations) who was the leader of a team of customs officers who visited the Lawpark premises in Wetherill Park on 6 March 1990: Tcpt, 14/04/05, pp 213-219; nor does the cross-examination of Mr Locker: Tcpt, 14/04/05, pp 275-277. The grounds relevant to this challenge should be rejected. 
       
       
      (c) Reference to offence in notice to produce documents 
      
    90 The complaint in this respect was that the notice to produce documents merely identified the goods to which the documents related as a bottle of spirits labelled “Cheval Napoleon Old French Brandy”, illegally dealt with by Lawpark on or before 31 October 1998. Such a notice was incapable of being complied with; Mr Parker could not reasonably have been expected to locate the relevant documents, because the notice was hopelessly imprecise as to the goods in question. The notice was therefore invalid. That element of invalidity was accepted by the Comptroller for the purposes of the proceedings and was sufficient in itself to invoke the operation of s 138 of the Evidence Act, as recognised by her Honour at [22].  
     
      
       
      (d) Non-compliance not established 
      
    91 The fact that the request for production of documents was invalid, meant that there could be no valid trigger engaging the power to execute the warrant. To that extent, the search and seizure which followed were also invalid. However, the Appellant separately asserted that there had been no failure to comply with the request, even assuming it were valid, so as to engage the power to execute the warrant, thereby constituting a separate complaint of improper or unlawful conduct. 
     
      
    92 In circumstances where the invalidity of the warrant depended upon failure to specify adequately the goods thought to be the subject of illegal dealing, failure to comply might not be an independent complaint if the failure were based upon the inability to identify the goods and therefore the relevant documents. In order to evaluate the separate claim, it is necessary to consider the legal principle to be applied, the identity of the officer who was responsible for making the relevant decision and the factual material upon which the decision was based. 
     
      
    93 With respect to the legal principle, the power to execute the warrant will arise in circumstances where a person “fails to comply with a requirement” of the Collector under sub-s 214(1): see sub-s (3). The requirement in question is to “immediately … produce and hand over” all books and documents relating to the goods believed to have been illegally dealt with and those relating to all other goods imported or exported within the preceding five years. Failure to comply with that requirement will involve a degree of evaluative judgment: the first question to be answered is by whom the facts are to be assessed, whether the individual officer, or the Court. 
     
      
    94 The power to execute the warrant is conferred, not on the Collector who requires production, but on the officer of Customs or the police having the Customs warrant. In Ace Custom Services Pty Ltd v Collector of Customs (NSW) (1991) 104 ALR 463 at 471, Davies J in proceedings brought in the Federal Court to review a seizure of documents under s 214, held that the words “fails to comply” refer to “what occurred in fact, not to the Collector’s, or [the officer’s] view as to what occurred”. His Honour referred with approval to what was said by Nagle J in Ganke v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1975] 1 NSWLR 252 (NSWCA, Street CJ, Nagle and Begg JJ). It may be noted that Ganke was concerned with an offence constituted by a failure to furnish information required by the Commissioner in circumstances where the Commissioner had fixed a period within which the information was to be supplied. The Court held that whether or not there had been a failure depended upon whether a reasonable time had been allowed for compliance and that the reasonableness of the time was to be determined by the Court. However, Nagle J also stated that the matter could equally be approached on the basis suggested by Asprey JA in R v Skurray (1967) 86 WN(NSW) (Pt 1) 1 at 8 that “the word ‘fails’ itself bears the connotation of a lapse of time to enable compliance with the obligation of performance”. 
     
      
    95 By contrast, in Holmes v Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1988) 88 ATC 4328 at 4339, Davies J adopted the view that a requirement by the Commissioner that the applicant attend at a particular place on a particular date to give evidence on oath before identified officers could only be set aside if the time allowed was manifestly unreasonable in the Wednesbury sense adopted for the purposes of judicial review of administrative actions. In Ace Custom Services, his Honour referred to his own judgment in Holmes, but appears to have adopted a different approach, albeit also in judicial review proceedings. 
     
      
    96 The circumstances envisaged by s 214 of the Customs Act give rise to a somewhat different question from that which arises in relation to the issue of a notice or a warrant pursuant to a statutory procedure: c.f. Carroll v Mijovich (1991) 25 NSWLR 441. The present issue does not concern the commission of an offence, or the issue of the warrant pursuant to a statutory process, but rather the condition for execution of a warrant presumed, for this purpose, to be validly issued. This may engage the example given by Asprey JA in Skurray (p 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “If a person does not produce a ticket upon the request of an inspector on a railway train, that person can only be said to have failed to produce the ticket if, in the absence of a refusal to exhibit it, he did not do so after the lapse of a period of time to enable him to obtain the ticket from his person or some accompanying luggage.” 
        
       
      
    97 As this example illustrates, separate questions will arise as to whether a person refusing a lawful request has committed an offence or whether the requesting officer will be entitled to execute a warrant. Where compliance with a request is a process, commencement will not necessarily prevent failure, although difficult questions of judgment may arise where there is ongoing production of documents in a dilatory and unreasonable manner. Indeed even a refusal may not involve a failure if, within a reasonable time from the first making of the request, the recipient of the request has a change of heart. 
     
      
    98 In the case of s 214(1) of the Customs Act, failure to comply, sufficient to constitute an offence may be tested differently from a failure to comply sufficient to engage the power to execute a warrant under sub-s (3). However, these questions were not discussed on the appeal. The relevant ground alleged that her Honour should have held that the officers “did not allow a reasonable time for compliance”. If by that it is meant that the warrant was executed before the time which would have been reasonably necessary for the production and handing over of all documents answering the notice had elapsed, that may be conceded. Her Honour’s rejection of the challenge in relation to execution was that “[o]nce the defendant had denied having possession of any relevant documents there was no point in waiting any longer”. 
     
      
    99 There appeared to be some confusion in the written submissions for the Appellant as to the party on whom the burden of proving impropriety lay and whether a subjective or objective test was to be applied. The matter was presented as a question of fact for the trial judge. If the proper test was the reasonable satisfaction of the officer, that was not argued on the appeal or, it would seem, before her Honour. 
     
      
    100 The facts involved two notices, one of which was executed by Mr Mutton at premises occupied by Lawpark at Wetherill Park. The second was executed at premises occupied by Kingswood, by Mr Morrison. 
     
      
    101 The Kingswood search need not be addressed. When Mr Morrison was called, counsel for the Appellant stated (Tcpt, 13/04/05, p 128): 
     
      
       
        
        “[His affidavit] also deals with, in large part, the seizure that took place on the Kingswood Distillery. We don’t make any challenge in relation to any activity of that seizure at Kingswood. We make some criticisms about the notice itself that was issued, but not in relation to Kingswood. Our complaints arise out of the execution of the notice and warrant at the premises of Breven and Lawpark.” 
        
       
       
      Accordingly, to the extent that the Notice of Appeal and the written submissions sought to resurrect some complaint in that regard, that should be rejected. 
       
      
    102 The issues to be addressed arise with respect to the Lawpark search at Wetherill Park. In relation to burden of proof, the Appellant contended that the evidence of Mr Mutton “did not, of itself, establish that sufficient time for compliance had been allowed”: Submissions, par 75. However, it was not for the Comptroller to prove compliance, but rather for the Appellant, as the party seeking to exclude the evidence, to satisfy the court that the evidence was improperly or unlawfully obtained: see Coulstock (1998) 99 A Crim R 143 at 146-7 (Hunt CJ at CL). How the Appellant sought to satisfy this burden is unclear: he gave no evidence himself on the voir dire, nor did he call evidence. No doubt he was entitled to rely upon evidence called by the Comptroller in order to establish his (the Appellant’s) case, but it is not sufficient to complain that the Comptroller’s evidence did not establish a contrary case. 
     
      
    103 In relation to the search at Wetherill Park, Mr Mutton gave evidence that he entered the bond store at 8.55am on 6 March 1990. He met a person who identified himself as Mr Edward Parker and sought to speak with Mr Stephen Parker. Mr Edward Parker apparently telephoned Mr Stephen Parker, who arrived at the premises at 9.26am. A short conversation took place and Mr Parker was given the ‘Notice to Produce Documents’. In an affidavit sworn on 3 May 2004, Mr Mutton gave evidence of a conversation in the following terms (par 39): 
     
      
       
        
        “He said: ‘Is this a special investigation?’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘Yes, you could call it that.’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: ‘Basically what you’re saying is that this is a 214.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘Yes …’ 
         
        … 
         
        He said: ‘Because of only one bottle you’re doing all this – you want all the documents for every importation.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘All documentation relating to the brandy.’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: ‘You’re sure it’s my brandy.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘Yes we’ve had it analysed. It’s not wholly produced from grape spirit. It contains grain spirit.’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: ‘You want all documents due to analysis of one bottle of brandy?’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘We also want documents relating to the extension of the brandy.’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: ‘I don’t know anything about extension – I refute ever knowingly ever having extended brandy.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: “Do you understand the notice?’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: ‘Yes okay. You want all the documents for 5 years.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: “I want the other documents relating to the extension. I believe there are some.’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: ‘Jim I don’t know what you’re talking about – I’m quite happy to give you any documents as long as you specify what they are.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘In relation to the brandy and the extension. Blending records, bottling etc.’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: “I can’t give you any documents relating to the extension.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘So you’re refusing to comply?’ 
        
       
       
        
        He said: ‘I don’t refuse to give you any documents but I can’t give you something I haven’t got.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said: ‘Show me the blending records.’” 
        
       
      
    104 Although the conversation may have suggested that Mr Mutton would have been satisfied with something less than full compliance, as events unfolded nothing turned on that. The conversations with Mr Stephen Parker and another person working with the company continued until sometime after 10am. 
     
      
    105 At that stage Mr Mutton formed the view that the documents he had been shown were incomplete; that information supplied by Mr Parker was inconsistent with other information he had available to him; that a larger quantity of spirit had been dealt with by Breven than the records showed and that there were no records to account for movement of goods from the bottling plant at Wetherill Park to retail outlets. He also affirmed a belief that such records should have existed. At 10.10am he executed the warrant. In doing so, he told Mr Parker that he was “not convinced you are telling the truth”. 
     
      
    106 Mr Mutton was cross-examined on the evidence referred to above. The cross-examination ranged broadly across many aspects of the case. However, in order to establish that there had not been a failure to comply with the notice, it was necessary to demonstrate that Mr Mutton was in error in not believing Mr Parker, presumably by demonstrating that he had been shown the documents he thought were missing, or that no such documents in fact existed or that the anomalies noted by Mr Mutton were otherwise explicable. It does not appear that any such exercise was undertaken. The closest the cross-examination came to that exercise was in the following passage (Tcpt, 14/04/05, p 243): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Let me suggest to you that your position was that, when you attended the premises, you believed Lawpark to be guilty of extending alcohol; is that not so? 
         
        A. I was very suspicious of it, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. No, you believed them to be guilty, didn’t you? 
         
        A. I think I mentioned before, if Mr Parker had have been able to come up with some explanation, a reasonable explanation, I – depending on what it was, I might have been happy with that explanation.” 
        
       
      
    107 There ensued further questions in relation to the explanation which Mr Mutton was given and an attempt was made to have him accept that it was a good explanation. He did not do so and there was no evidence called which established the correctness of the explanation proffered. On the basis of this evidence, her Honour was entitled to find that Mr Parker had failed to comply with the notice in the sense that he had demonstrated no willingness to produce and hand over all of the documents required by the notice. Although that exercise, if attempted, might have taken some time, it was open to her Honour to accept Mr Mutton’s evidence and to infer that Mr Parker was not engaging upon that exercise. His refusal or even unwillingness to do so constituted a failure to comply immediately with the notice. On appeal, no objective reason for disbelieving Mr Mutton was established. Her Honour formed a favourable view of his evidence and, in those circumstances, was entitled to accept it. No error is demonstrated in her conclusion that the Appellant had not discharged his burden of demonstrating that he had not failed to comply with the notice. 
     
      
       
      (e) Failure to train and educate officers 
      
    108 The final complaint pressed by the Appellant related to the failure to train and educate customs officers in relation to the scope of a search permissible in execution of a warrant. 
     
      
    109 As noted above, a proper consideration of s 214 does not support the view expressed in O’Neill’s Case that the search permitted in execution of the warrant did not entitle customs officers to locate and seize documents in relation to goods imported or exported during the previous five years. However, the Comptroller did not dispute the correctness of O’Neill’s Case but rather relied upon the fact that Mr Swinton, who was the solicitor primarily responsible for legal advice in relation to the operation had failed to grasp the significance of the reference to O’Neill’s Case in counsel’s advice. Accordingly, the complaint that the trial judge failed to address the issue must be addressed on that basis. 
     
      
    110 It is important to note that the complaint relates to lack of training in relation to the legitimate scope of the search and seizure of documents permitted by a warrant under s 214(3): it is not concerned with the scope of the search and seizure themselves. That is presumably because, as noted by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Haddad and Treglia [2000] NSWCCA 351; (2000) 116 A Crim R 312 at [67], “The common law has long accepted that a police officer executing a warrant may seize goods and evidence reasonably believed to relate to a criminal offence, even though the offence is not that for which the warrant was granted”. (His Honour identified supporting authority for that proposition including, in this State, GH Photography Pty Ltd v McGarrigle [1974] 2 NSWLR 635 at 645 (Mahoney J).) 
     
      
    111 The complaint that Simpson J did not address this challenge in her reasons is factually correct. However, given the way in which the issue was presented in submissions, her Honour’s failure to address it is at least understandable. Thus, in written submissions dated 18 April 2005 (par 100) the complaint was noted in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “In particular, and notwithstanding that the officers had a copy of the decision of  
        In the matter of O’Neill 
        , it seems perfectly clear that they did not understand the principles summarised in that decision.” 
        
       
      
    112 Those submissions also referred to a letter from the Australian Government Solicitor in South Australia dated 31 July 1989 referring to the “distribution and discussion within your Department” of the correct procedure applicable under s 214. That letter contained a warning that “a submission in any further litigation regarding honest mistakes and ignorance of the legislative provisions would, in my view, not succeed in convincing a court to refrain from excluding illegally obtained evidence”. 
     
      
    113 In oral submissions at trial, the point was made in more florid terms (Tcpt, 18/04/05, p 324); after referring to the passage last quoted from in the AGS advice, counsel continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not a bad assessment from the AGS, and yet your Honour has not been favoured with one piece of evidence from anyone which explains why it was that the AGS in Australia could get it so right and New South Wales could get it so wrong, and could not even afford to provide their officers with some summary of this important decision which, indeed, demonstrates, in part, the very illegal conduct of which we complain.  
        O’Neill’s case 
        , of course, deals with this obligation to seize only those documents relevant to the particular goods.” 
        
       
      
    114 These submissions were a trifle ingenuous. Following the advice of 31 July 1989, a further letter was sent to the Collector of Customs dated 11 August 1989, also from the AGS in South Australia, but over the signature of a different officer. It is clear that the recipient of the first letter, a Mr Buss, had a telephone conversation with Mr Justin O’Halloran of AGS on 11 August. Mr O’Halloran then wrote on behalf of the Australian Government Solicitor, stating that “I have reconsidered my advice concerning the right of customs officers acting under subsection 214(3) … to take possession of, remove and impound books and documents other than books and documents relating directly to the goods” that had been detained or were the subject of information on oath. Mr O’Halloran opined that “the decision of Judge Dunford In the matter of O’Neill … is wrong”. His view, concisely stated, is to the same effect as that addressed above, which had also been raised by Dunford DCJ and rejected. Mr O’Halloran said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It appears to me that the words ‘any books or documents relating to the goods’ used in the subsection 214(3) in fact refer not merely to ‘all books and documents relating to the goods so imported exported entered seized or detained undervalued or illegally dealt with …’ but also to all other goods imported or exported by him at any time in the period of 5 years immediately preceding such request seizure or detention. This interpretation accords with the purpose of the section and accordingly is in my opinion the proper interpretation of that section. The alternative interpretation produces an arbitrary and illogical result. … 
        
       
       
        
        It seems to me that Judge Dunford allowed the terms of the warrant to determine the meaning of subsection 214(3). In my opinion this approach is wrong.” 
        
       
      
    115 The officer whose knowledge of such matters was relevant for present purposes was Mr James Mutton, who was responsible for the operation at Lawpark’s premises. He stated that he had been involved in action taken under s 214 on approximately 12 occasions prior to 6 March 1990 and had undertaken an advanced investigations course in about September or October 1989. He recalled that the decision of Dunford DCJ was discussed in the course but did not recall any reference being made to “anything in the decision concerning the scope of s 214 warrants”. 
     
      
    116 Mr Ronald Benson was the Chief Inspector to whom Mr Mutton was answerable and from whom he took instructions. In his affidavit of 3 May 2004, he stated awareness of O’Neill’s Case when it was being argued but did not recall seeing or reading the judgment prior to his retirement in 1991. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “At some time I was told that Judge Dunford had said in  
        O’Neill’s Case 
         that a s 214 warrant could not be used to seize ‘five year documents’. I do not recall when I was told this. Such a limitation on the warrants power was never suggested to me from any other judicial source up to the time of my retirement. Throughout my time at Customs I was not aware of the seizure of documents ever having been challenged on that basis in any of the cases in which I was involved.” 
        
       
      
    117 He was cross-examined in relation to the first AGS advice of 31 July 1989, but not the second. He stated (Tcpt, 13/04/05, p 105(45)-(55)): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So by about March 1990 you understood that a warrant was exercised, the only documents which could be seized were the goods relating to the actual goods identified in the notice to produce? 
         
        A. That was the opinion in the  
        O’Neill case 
        . 
        …Q. And you understood that to be the position by March of 1990; is that not so?A. I understood that to be the position as described in the O’Neill case. I don’t believe that the law was settled on that issue at that time.” 
        
       
      
    118 Although the real issue was not presented in detail or with great clarity to her Honour in submissions, it may be accepted for present purposes that there was an issue concerning training of officers in relation to the scope of the warrant which needed to be addressed. However, it is clear that Customs did not ignore the decision in O’Neill but obtained their own advice in relation to it. As Dunford DCJ himself explained in his reasons, there were cogent arguments for both the broader and the narrower view of the power. Customs obtained advice from the AGS favouring the broader view, which advice was neither clearly mistaken, nor based on any misunderstanding of the statutory provision in question, nor of the principles of statutory construction. In any case where the scope of a statutory power is doubtful, an authority which adopts a broader rather than a narrower view may later be found to have exceeded its authority. However, at least in the present circumstances, there was no deliberate or reckless disregard of an established constraint on power, nor can Customs fairly be criticised for not adhering to the narrower view and directing its officers accordingly. It had plausible legal advice supportive of its position. It did not act improperly, for the purposes of s 138, in failing to instruct its officers to operate otherwise. 
     
      
       
      Application of discretion to admit evidence 
      
    119 Any assessment of the discretionary factors identified in s 138(3) must be undertaken in light of the statutory purpose, which is to provide a context for the resolution of the conflicting public interests noted above. 
     
      
    120 The first consideration is that the seizure of a large volume of documents without consent and without the authority of a valid warrant involved a major invasion of the rights of Lawpark and Breven to be free of such interference in their affairs, without those responsible having lawful justification for their conduct. In terms of par (d) of s 138(3), the consequence of the contravention was a serious intrusion on the rights of the companies. (It was not argued on the appeal that there was any contravention of a right of a “person” recognised by the ICCPR, for the purposes of par (f).) That factor would weigh heavily against the admission of the documents seized. Indeed, if combined with wilful disregard of the legal requirements of the relevant customs officers, the case for rejection of the evidence would be strong, if not overwhelming. 
     
      
    121 There were, however, significant countervailing considerations. Thus it was properly held by the trial judge, and not disputed on appeal, that the evidence was critical to establishing the unlawful conduct of the Appellant (amongst others); it not only constituted virtually the whole of the prosecution case, but it was compelling. Nor was it established that its probative value was diminished by the unlawfulness attaching to the execution of the warrant. Further, for the purposes of par (c), the purpose for which the evidence was to be used was a prosecution of a criminal offence; the offence was, in its own right, serious, involving a deliberate flouting of the revenue laws for commercial benefit over a considerable period. When those considerations are weighed against the unlawfulness involved in the conduct of the customs officers, the significance of the latter is greatly reduced. Ultimately, the weighing exercise required to determine whether the evidence should be admitted must turn on whether the actions of the customs officers could properly be described as involving a wilful disregard of legal constraints imposed on their powers. It was no doubt in recognition of that factor that much effort was exerted by the Appellant at trial in attempting to establish, if not wilful disregard, at least indifference to the legal requirements of the lawful exercise of the powers under s 214. 
     
      
    122 The seriousness of the intrusion on the rights of Lawpark and apparently Breven, through the seizure of their documents, flowed from the extraordinary breadth of the power conferred by s 214. The seriousness of the consequence for the affected businesses of an unlawful exercise of the power warranted careful scrutiny of the conduct of Customs: however, it did not turn genuine attempts at compliance into deliberate disregard or reckless indifference. 
     
      
    123 While the Comptroller accepted that the notice to produce was inadequate in its specification of the subject matter of the offence, so that non-compliance did not engage the power to execute the warrant, he did not concede that the request for production was a charade having only one purpose, namely to provide an apparent trigger for the execution of the warrant. The Appellant sought to establish that improper purpose and to add a further serious impropriety, namely a search and seizure going beyond the understood limits of the power conferred by the warrant. However, the Appellant failed to satisfy her Honour that at any stage there had been wilful disregard of the law, dishonourable or dishonest motives or improper purposes at play. For the reasons set out above, the challenges to her Honour’s findings in respect of those matters has failed.  
     
      
    124 In the result, the unlawfulness of the conduct of customs officers turned on the failure adequately to identify the bottle of brandy said to have been illegally dealt with pursuant to the Spirits Act. There was no evidence to indicate that it would not have been relatively easy to comply with that obligation of specificity. However, the fact that it was not done was not due to deliberate cutting of corners or disregard of the legal requirements. On one view, the error arose from a failure to reproduce in the notice requiring production of documents the detailed information supplied on oath for the purposes of s 214(1). 
     
      
    125 Furthermore, it was not demonstrated that, in any practical sense, the vagueness in the notice caused the failure to produce documents. Although the specific documents relating to the particular bottle of brandy might well have been impossible to locate and identify, they would almost certainly have been caught up in the broader category of documents relating to goods imported or exported during the previous five years, unless that brandy had been held for more than two years prior to reaching the retail market. If any prejudice had flowed from the acknowledged error, it might have been demonstrated by evidence proffered by the Appellant: none was. 
     
      
    126 In addition to the issues considered above, the Appellant asserted inadequacy in the reasons provided by the primary judge for reaching her conclusion. However, the appeal being governed by s 75A of the Supreme Court Act has involved a rehearing. Although it is true that her Honour made findings in relation to the motives and state of mind of the customs officers in a global way, without considering the evidence of each in detail, no doubt has been cast on her Honour’s conclusions by an analysis of the transcript and the documentary record. The case presented in cross-examination of key witnesses on behalf of the Appellant was simply not accepted by the customs officers, often on the basis that they had no such beliefs, could not speculate about the views of others or could not recall the events in sufficient detail to comment. The documentary record neither demonstrated the Appellant’s assertions of wilful disregard of the legal requirements of s 214, nor provided a substantial basis for contradicting the officers. 
     
      
    127 The Appellant also criticised her Honour’s reasons in that they failed explicitly to weigh the mandatory factors set out in s 138(3). On a reading of her Honour’s reasons, the criticism appeared to have force. However, once the real issues in the case were identified, it is clear that these issues were addressed. Some of the mandatory considerations (such as breach of the ICCPR and the possibility or absence of disciplinary action) simply did not arise on the case as presented at trial. Even if there were deficiencies in the reasons with respect to the balancing exercise required by s 138(3), once the relevant factual basis was accepted, the balancing exercise could as well be undertaken by this Court on a rehearing as by the trial judge. That exercise has now been completed. A challenge to the inadequacy of her Honour’s reasons in that respect was beside the point. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
      
    128 Each of the challenges to her Honour’s judgment addressed on the appeal should be rejected. The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

    JUDGMENT1. Justyn Gaddie is a relatively unsophisticated 20 year old. Prior to this offending conduct which brought him before the Court, he is what is known as “a cleanskin”, that is, he has never been previously charged with or convicted of any offence. He is before the Court having been charged with and pleading guilty to an ongoing supply of ecstasy. There are two further offences which he admits pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1989 and asks that they be taken into account on a Form 1, namely, supplying three tablets of ecstasy at Castle Hill on 16 September and having in his possession a prohibited drug, namely, cannabis seeds totalling 21 grams on 16 February 2007.2. Today begins the process by which he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. In this case there is a real question of whether his level of and reasons for dealing in drugs is such that a full time sentence may be called for. S.5 (1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act seeks to make imprisonment a sentence of last resort. In the spirit of that sub section, I am satisfied full time custody should be a sentence of last resort. 3. The issue for me is whether the claimed intentions of the offender to rehabilitate can materialise. If they could, then a sentence of full time imprisonment, in my view, would not be called for. If, on the other hand, he cannot succeed in rehabilitating, that is a significant factor I would need to take in account in my final task, or my primary task, rather, of ensuring the protection of the community, hence a full time period of custody may well be called for. His capacity to rehabilitate must be an issue when one considers the lifestyle the offender was leading at the time of his offending conduct. His evidence was that he was out at hotels Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights and that whilst out at hotels was consuming ecstasy and one can infer therefore, partying along. 4. It is necessary to set out the offending conduct, make some assessment of its objective criminality, examine the personal circumstances of the offender, and set out in detail the proposed resolution of this matter. Facts5. The facts have been agreed and I will simply recite them as they are contained in exhibit A. On 5 April 2006, Deputy Commissioner Collins authorised a controlled operation authority authorising police to conduct the control purchases of prohibited drugs at Castle Hill Tavern. A special task force was set up for that purpose. One of the suspects identified was this offender. There were four other suspects also identified who, it would appear, were close associates of his also operating at the tavern.6. On 16 September 2006, an undercover police operative for the purposes of these facts identified as UCO “A” attended the Castle Hill Tavern and engaged in a conversation with all of those suspects, or some of them, including this offender. This conversation took place: UCO “A”, “I need some pills”. One suspect, “How many do you need?” UCO “A”, “How many do you have?” This offender, “I only have three left”, UCO “A” “Is that all, oh well, that will have to do for now, how much?” Suspect “$30 each”. UCO “A” “$30 each, that’s a bit steep”, This offender, “Don’t worry, we will look after you at the next one”. 7. The offender then got up and motioned for the undercover operative to follow him. The offender headed towards the car park entrance and shortly thereafter supplied the undercover operative with three cream coloured tablets with the “Hi 5” insignia contained in three clear resealable glad bags for $90. They were of course methylenedioxymethamphetamine of eighteen percent, weighing a total of 0.77 grams. That is the offence, as I understand it, which is the first offence on the Form 1.8. The indicted offence or the offence to which the offender has pleaded guilty, is one of during a thirty day period between 6 December 2006 and 4 January 2007, the offender supplied amphetamine based drugs to an undercover police operative on a total of three separate occasions, all of them occurring on the evening of 7 December 2006. 9. At intervals of about 45 minutes, three undercover police operatives were the purchasers of those various deliveries. When questioned later in an electronic interview, (in fairness, it should be said some four months later), the offender stated that the money he received from the undercover operatives was used by him to purchase drinks throughout that night. The undercover operative B contacted the offender by phone, negotiated a supply of methylamphetamine tablets. There had been previous contact between B and the offender at the Castle Hill Tavern, but there is no suggestion in the evidence before me of any prior dealing.10. During the telephone conversation, the offender directed undercover operative B to the Castle Hill Tavern. At 8 o’clock, undercover operative B attended the Castle Hill Tavern. Contact was made. The offender supplied undercover operative B with two white coloured tablets, with a Chanel insignia contained in two clear resealable bags. The sale price for the two was $50. They were methylamphetamine of five percent purity weighing 0.58 grams. At 9.32 the same night, undercover operative C attended the Castle Hill Tavern, there was renewed contact by undercover operative B, undercover operative B and C then negotiated a supply of methylamphetamine tablets. They were supplied by this offender, that is two were supplied by this offender for $50, again it was it seems from the same source, it had a Chanel insignia. That sale constituted 0.59 grams. 11. The third supply was at about 10.45 and contact on this occasion was made through undercover operative C, but the purchaser was undercover operative D. Much the same mechanisms appears to have been used, and again, two small resealable glad bags each containing a white cream tablet with the Chanel insignia were exchanged for $50. The subsequent analysis and weight of those was methylamphetamine weighing 0.57 grams. Those three transactions constitute the indicted offence. 12. Pursuant to a search warrant executed on 16 February 2007, police located in a bedside table drawer, a small resealable plastic bag containing a number of small seeds with a weight of 0.21 grams. The offender conceded after caution that the seeds belonged to him and that they were cannabis. He was arrested, cautioned and later participated in an electronically recorded interview at the Mount Druitt police station. He was taken back the four months to the supply on 16 September and he claimed that the tablets he had supplied had been earlier handed to him by one of the suspects. The offender claimed that he did not pay for them and used the proceeds of the sale to purchase drinks during the night.13. In relation to the supplies on 7 December, he accepted that he had been approached by two females and a male and had sold tablets two for $50, at a price of two for $50. He agreed to the circumstances of the transactions as I have described them earlier. 14. In relation to those six tablets. he stated that he had been given a total of seven tablets by the suspect and he had taken one himself and supplied the other six on request at a price of $50 for the two. He stated that used the proceeds of the sale of the drugs to purchase drinks during the night and also stated that he did not pay the suspect for the drugs. He agreed that he and that suspect were fairly good friends. That concludes the agreed facts. 15. There was a medical report tendered from Doctor Pickering and a psychological report tendered from Doctor Alex Galandris, both of which sought to make a case for the use of drugs by way of self medication for conditions of post traumatic stress and of depression. What is clear from the evidence before me is that at the time this offender was describing symptoms to Doctor Galandris and Doctor Pickering, If one has regard to the lifestyle that he was living in September when the primary offence I am dealing with occurred, there seemed to be some inconsistencies with the account that he gave to the doctors and the lifestyle that he was living. I say that because I am not comfortable in finding that he was self medicating. Many young men his age use ecstasy as a party drug, as a recreational drug, and I cannot accept the proposition that all of them are in one way or another self-medicating, and I do not accept the proposition that this offender was self-medicating. My view is that he was out there to enjoy himself and was using the ecstasy for that purpose.16. There was evidence in the interview, with which he agreed, that whilst he was using ecstasy, he was partying to such an extent that he needed to take breaks, go downstairs to the car park to cool off, and to re-hydrate by taking water with him. They do not appear to me to be the actions of a person who is seeking to hide from life, but rather, one who is seeking to enjoy it to the fullest. 17. I am satisfied he had been going to and involved with at some level, the distribution of drugs for a period prior to police targeting him as a suspect at the Castle Hill Tavern. The significance of that will be seen shortly, this was not a one-off offence. I should also indicate that I have some real difficulty accepting the proposition of the remarkable coincidence that he claims he was given tablets by one of the suspects on each occasion that a police officer encountered him, particularly in the absence of any explanation for the giving to him of those tablets by the other suspect, and in circumstances where I am satisfied that other suspect was dealing in drugs for profit. It would follow from that, as will be seen a little later on, that I am not entirely confident he has been frank with me whilst giving evidence in the witness box.Objective criminality18. Many dealing in drugs fail to understand why their conduct should be classified as criminal. Firstly, many drugs are addictive. There are many in the community who are psychologically addicted to ecstasy. Drugs, including ecstasy, can also be biologically addictive. Addicts are people whose capacity to function in a community to a greater or lesser extent is impeded by virtue of their addiction. There are other health issues associated with the consumption of drugs, including ecstasy. 19. Money paid for drugs constitutes a huge transfer of wealth without any corresponding valuable, economic productivity. The money so transferred comes in the main from working persons and the unemployed, that is, from people who can least afford to lose their money in this way. Addiction is also associated with crimes such as break and enter, fraud and robbery. 20. Each one of these outcomes is an anti social consequence of drug dealing. It is for that reason that dealing in drugs is regarded by the community, and rightly regarded by this court, as criminal conduct of a serious kind. Dealing in drugs for financial gain requires, other than in exceptional cases, an offender to be incarcerated. 21. In this case, I am satisfied the offender had previously been dealing in drugs. The evidence before me establishes he was attending Castle Hill Tavern for some time before and that people were coming up to him and asking him for ecstasy. My own experience which some might say is not inconsiderable in terms of attending clubs, is that nobody has ever approached me when I was young or when I was old, asking whether I had any ecstasy on me. I can only conclude that this offender’s reputation in the pub was that he would be prepared to supply or deal with ecstasy.22. The evidence does disclose some prior dealing, such as the evidence is I cannot be satisfied he was other than a low level dealer. I am satisfied he dealt for modest or very modest profit. He claims to have received ten tablets from an associate, my own view is that that is probably unlikely, but if the tablets were given to him contrary to my own view, they were given to him as some reward associated with his drug dealing or co-operation with somebody who was drug dealing. Thus, the starting point is to recognise the ongoing dealing before me was not isolated incident. 23. The total drugs on the indicted charge is about 1.70 grams, and constitutes nine tablets. In those circumstances, even though it was for a modest financial gain, it does constitute trading for financial purposes and at least, unless it is an exceptional case, does require full time incarceration. But on any view, it would be towards the very lowest range on the scale of offending, that is to say, if there was to be incarceration, a sentence of nine months imprisonment with a finding of special circumstances would seem to me to be appropriate.Custodial History24. After his arrest, the offender was bail refused for a period of three and a half weeks. He said that he shared a cell with a full on drug addict. He found the experience very bad, he was scared. He noticed what I might call bizarre behaviour in that the drug addict that he was sharing with was rocking back and forth. From my own experience I know that drug consumption and drug history is a very prominent topic of conversation and focus within the prison system.25. Subsequently he was given bail with strict reporting and curfew conditions and his evidence was that he adhered to them rigidly. Subjective Matters26. To his credit, he has been with Big W for a period now of I think about six years. His work puts him outside probably meeting and handling the trucks, unloading produce, is what I am imagining. He says that he has not taken any drugs. He does though still continue to consume alcohol, but acknowledges that as a problem. He is willing to abide by alcohol counselling, he is willing to abide by any conditions that are set in respect of s 11 bail. The other significant important factor is that he has formed a relationship with Alana Walton who also came and gave evidence. I am satisfied a genuine, fruitful and from this offender’s point of view, healthy relationship exists, a relationship that would have, I imagine, a good impact on him, a positive impact on him.27. He sees a career path in his present position that could lead to managerial status and perhaps even the manager. He says that there have been others who have pursued such a path with some success. He has support from one of the assistant managers there, Miss Winfield, who says that she has observed Justyn at work during her time at Big W, has particularly noticed a positive attitude to both his employer and the store customers. Her view is that he is keen and dedicated as an employee, is always prepared to take on extra hours, when offered, is friendly and helpful to his workmates and customers, and her experience is he is very trustworthy, not, you might think, one that I have come to at this point in time. He has taken on extra work that comes with Christmas, and she says,  
     
      
      “gives you a hundred percent to get all his jobs finalised”. 
       
      
     I am satisfied in the workplace he is committed, and is fulfilled, enjoys his work, he says he does and I accept that he does. 28. His general background is that he is single, resides with his mother, and a younger half sister and half brother. He has not known his biological father and so far as I can see is the only man within the household. His mother believes that the absence of stable parental discipline and role modelling tended to attract the wrong type to him because he was not a leader but a follower.29. He obtained his School Certificate in Year 10 but when he was 15 he left school because he was seeking full time employment. He probably does suffer, and I accept that he does, from ADHD, or one of those disorders, which may have made schooling more difficult for him than it would have for others. I noted in the psychological testing that he was assessed as above average intelligence. Watching him in the witness box, I am satisfied that is so. 30. As to drugs and alcohol, he was consuming alcohol when he was 16 and that perhaps is his primary addiction problem, if it be an addiction. There are occasions, I understand, frequent occasions, when he goes on binge drinking. At 17 he was smoking cannabis, his accounting for that was to ease the pain from a prior accident. At 19 he turned to amphetamines, dropping his interest in cannabis, he says, in which case I assume the pain must have abated because his consumption of ecstasy saw him on the dance floor dancing to a point where, as I say, he had to go and seek quiet time, coolness and a drink. He says that other than at work, he stays home most of the time and that he had severed all contacts to other than his family.Rehabilitation Issues31. I suppose now is an appropriate time to deal with one of my concerns having heard his evidence. He said that he left his former associates and strictly adhered to his curfew and had not taken drugs whilst on bail. The evidence from his girlfriend Alana Walton was that she met him at the Castle Hill Tavern, a place where he had been associating with drug dealers, where he had been drinking and where he had been taking drugs. While it was not explored in evidence, the two propositions appear to me contradictory in respect of leaving his former associates, in respect of strict adherence to the curfew, and possibly in respect of his claim to be abstaining from drugs. 32. Doctor Galandris’ report, as I say, puts him in above average intelligence. There is a diagnosis by him and by Doctor Pickering of post traumatic stress disorder. A symptom of post traumatic stress disorder can be forgetfulness. In his ERISP (Electronically Recorded Interview with Suspected Person), and before me, he has claimed a lack of recall frequently, but his lack of recall, whenever it occurs on analysis, appears selective in the sense that it claims a failure to recall when it suits his case to do so. Consequently, I do not have the degree of confidence in his evidence, including his claimed motivation for reform, that I otherwise might have had had his failure to recall been universal rather than specifically directed to unfavourable evidence.33. It is for that reason that I have decided I need to observe him closely for the next nine months to give him a chance, even though he is in a category towards the lower end of the range of criminality, to demonstrate that his rehabilitation is to the extent that it can be assured. I have determined to stand these sentencing proceedings over for a period of nine months from today. I will set that date when I have got my diary.S.11 Bail Given34. The first thing I will need to do in a minute is to convict him of this offence in order to give him the bail, but it will be conditional upon him entering into bail to be of good behaviour for nine months from today and to agree to the further conditions pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Firstly, be of good behaviour; supply present address to the registry; notify the registry of the intended change in address; accept supervision by Probation and Parole and report to the Probation and Parole Office at Mount Druitt by 4.30 tomorrow afternoon; he will comply with all reasonable directions of the Probation and Parole; he would attend courses, treatment and programmes as directed by his case manager, they should be focused on drug and alcohol abuse and counselling. He is to refrain from the consumption of all alcoholic beverages for the period of the bail and he is further to refrain from the consumption of any illicit drug not prescribed. At his own expense or if he can get it on Medibank or whatever, but certainly if there is no other resource, at his own expense, the offender will attend random urinalysis, no more than four times monthly, that works out at least once a week, but it may be four times in the last week, he is not necessarily to know, random, no more than four a month. 35. If that random urinalysis is not oversighted by Probation and Parole, he is to provide proof of random urinalysis otherwise arranged to Probation and Parole on or by 28th day of each month. He will have to set up his own system, work it out with the local doctor’s receptionist, or something like that, but it has got to be outside the family, does it not?LINEGAR: Yes.HIS HONOUR: It should be understood that the purpose of the random urinalysis is to provide urine for screening to analyse the presence of illicit drugs and/or alcohol. Any dirty urine or any failure to provide urine when requested is deemed a breach of the bail, and Probation and Parole is requested to notify me within 48 hours of such a breach coming to their attention, it may end up on 28th day of the month. He is to maintain employment with his present employer and do all he can to advance himself in that employment; he is to demonstrate a commitment to an interest, hobby or recreational pastime of his own choosing at each progress assessment.36. Mr Gaddie, I convict you of the offence that you between 11.30pm on 6 December 2006 and 12.40am on 4 January 07 at Plumpton, in the State of New South Wales, did on three or more separate occasions during that period of 30 consecutive days, supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis, to wit, amphetamine for financial or material reward. Your bail is part of the sentencing proceedings, and for that purpose I acknowledge that I am taking into account in granting the bail also the two matters on the Form 1.37. The bail will be on the conditions that I have just described and you will be required at three monthly intervals to come back to me and to demonstrate with evidence what you have done. Do not go out of the court and forget it.February 22 is a Friday, I am at Parramatta Court at that time, so that will be the first progress report. The next one June 6, I am still at Parramatta, so June 6. The final one will be September 5. The matter will be finalised on that day, assuming it is not finalised earlier. 38. In the event that there is a breach of bail, it would be finalised earlier. 39. I should have recorded in the reasons, and I will just have this added to them, that the way in which I see this finalising, assuming that the offender can establish the requisite essential circumstances by the quality of his rehabilitation is that a period of nine months of imprisonment will be imposed, special circumstances will be found, and the sentence will be suspended, probably without declaring a particular distribution between parole and non parole.CREPALDI: Your Honour, that final date of 5 September, where are we going to be sitting on that date?HIS HONOUR: The court to be advised.CREPALDI: Your Honour, I have a difficulty at this stage on 6 June, your Honour would be amenable to someone else from my office attending?HIS HONOUR: Yes, as long as you retain coverage of the brief.CREPALDI: Yes certainly your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Your bail will be given to you down in the office downstairs, you will get a copy of it, take that copy of it the Probation and Parole office tomorrow, and they will see what I want. They may ultimately get the judgment, but at least they will get some idea of what I want from that. Do you understand that? Anything else?CREPALDI: Yes your Honour, the matters on the 166 could be dealt with today, could be finalised today, couldn’t they?HIS HONOUR: If you wish.CREPALDI: It’s counts 2, 3 and 6 on the 166 certificate, they’re the individual supplies that go to make up the ongoing supply.HIS HONOUR: You want them withdrawn?CREPALDI: They can be formally withdrawn today, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Pursuant to s 166 of the Crimes Trial Procedure Act, leave is given to withdraw counts 2, 3 and 4.40. The formal order I make is I stand this over for finalising on 5 September next, I grant s 11 bail pursuant to conditions. I list for progress reports 22 February 2008 and 6 June 2008. The onus will be on the offender to convince me of rehabilitation. Onus means your task to persuade me, and I am hoping you see that I am a difficult man to persuade.

    2 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Basten JA. 
     
      
    3 BASTEN JA: On 12 December 2001 police belonging to an interagency taskforce, which included the New South Wales Crime Commission (“the Commission”), executed a search warrant at premises known as 12/90 Mount Street, Coogee in the south-eastern suburbs of Sydney. The apartment was let to a Ms Shi Wei and a Mr Guo Qi Guang. Various valuables on the premises were seized by the police, together with a suitcase full of Australian currency totalling $769,300. Prohibited drugs were also found on the premises. 
     
      
    4 Ms Shi Wei was charged with two offences, one being supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and having goods in custody contrary to s 527C of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
     
      
    5 On 15 April 2002 a restraining order was made by the Court in relation to the money, pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (“the Act”). 
     
      
    6 Having obtained a “restraining order” the Commission was entitled to an “assets forfeiture order” pursuant to s 22 of the Act. Such an order is frequently sought in the application for the restraining order, though not made at the same time as the restraining order. The parties agreed that, subject to an application under s 25 of the Act by the Appellant (Mr Liu), the Commission was entitled to the forfeiture order. The application by Mr Liu was for “an exclusion order” which, if made, would exclude Mr Liu’s interest in the money from the forfeiture order and from the restraining order. The respective applications of the Commission and Mr Liu came before Mathews AJ who, on 24 April 2007, rejected Mr Liu’s application for an exclusion order and made the assets forfeiture order sought by the Commission. The present appeal is brought by Mr Liu from that decision. 
     
      
    7 In broad terms, the matters were run before her Honour on the basis that Mr Liu needed to establish on the balance of probabilities that the money was his and had been lawfully acquired by him. (It was common ground that the money was all his, or none was; the evidence did not permit a division.) To that end, he called evidence from a number of witnesses, including some who gave evidence by video-link from Hong Kong. Issues of credibility loomed large in her Honour’s assessment of the evidence, and particularly that of Mr Liu himself. It was accepted by both parties that if the Appellant established error in her Honour’s judgment, occasioning some substantial wrong or miscarriage, the matter would need to go back to the Common Law Division for a retrial. In my view, although error was demonstrated in relation to findings that an intended purchase of a poultry farm had been abandoned, her Honour’s conclusion was independently supported. The appeal should therefore be dismissed. 
     
      
    The statutory scheme8 The power of the Supreme Court to make an assets forfeiture order under s 22 of the Act is dependent upon the relevant interests in property being subject to a restraining order. (The language of the Act differs from similar legislation in other jurisdictions, particularly in its focus on “interests in property” as opposed to “property”: c.f. Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth) discussed in Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions v Hart [2007] QCA 184 (Keane JA, Williams JA agreeing, and Philippides J) and Confiscation Act 1987 (Vic) discussed in Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Le [2007] HCA 52.) A restraining order is made under s 10 of the Act, on the application of the Commission. It is an order which restrains all persons from disposing of or dealing with an interest in property. The application may be made on one of two bases (or on both) as provided in sub-s (2): 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) specified interests, a specified class of interests or all the interests, in property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, … or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) specified interests, or a specified class of interests, in property that are interests of any other person, or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) interests referred to in both paragraph (a) and (b).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 Read in isolation, the scope of this provision is not easy to discern. In relation to an application under paragraph (a), it would appear that an application may be made in relation to any property of a person suspected of having engaged in an activity of the kind described, without the need for any connection between the activity and the property. In relation to paragraph (b), it would appear that an application could be made in relation to any property of any person. In order to make sense of these provisions, it is necessary to read them with sub-s 10(3) which confers power (and indeed an obligation) on the Supreme Court to make the order applied for in specified circumstances. 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) The Supreme Court must make the order applied for under subsection (2) if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (2)(a) — the authorised officer suspects that the person has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in the case of an application in respect of any other interest — the authorised officer suspects that the interest is serious crime derived property because of a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities of a person and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and the Court considers that having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 With respect to the first category of interest, the element which is the subject of the affidavit is the officer’s suspicion that the person has engaged in a relevant serious crime related activity. What remains obscure is whether the officer or the Court is to be satisfied of a particular relationship between the property and the person. Nor is it clear how the interests are identified or indeed how the property is to be identified. In practice, the physical chattel, land or money is described, as it was in the present case, in a schedule to the draft orders accompanying the summons commencing proceedings in the Court. Relevantly, the schedule in the present case was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “$769,300 cash located in a maroon coloured Samsonite travel suitcase which was seized by police pursuant to a search warrant from Shi Wei’s bedroom at Unit A12, 90 Mount Street, Coogee.” 
        
       
      
    11 Paragraph 3(b), in referring to an application “in respect of any other interest” is to be understood as referring to an application under sub-s (2)(b). The use of the phrase “any other person”, in par (2)(b), to identify the owner of the property must be a reference to a person other than the suspect. In this case it is necessary that the officer hold a suspicion that “the interest is serious crime derived property because of a serious crime related activity”. The phrase “serious crime derived property” in this context is defined in s 9(1) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) An interest in property is serious crime derived property if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it is all or part of the proceeds of a serious crime related activity, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it is all or part of the proceeds of the disposal or other dealing in serious crime derived property, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) it was wholly or partly acquired using serious crime derived property.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The language of paragraph (3)(b) appears to adopt only the first limb of the definition in sub-s 9(1), unless the words “because of” are sufficiently broad to incorporate the other two limbs. That matter need not be determined for present purposes; what is notable, however, is again the absence of any requirement to state a basis for believing that a particular person has an interest in the property.  
     
      
    13 The phrase “interest in property” is defined in s 7 and, relevantly for present purposes, includes a reference to “the person’s money”: s 7(2)(a). Further, although no reliance was placed upon the provision in argument, where one person has an interest in property which is “subject to the effective control of another person”, the interest is deemed to be that of the person having control and not of the ‘owner’: s 7(3). Because the matter was not discussed, the potential ramifications of this provision must be put to one side, despite the fact that this case involved cash arguably the property of Mr Liu, but found in premises which he did not occupy and to which he appears to have had no means of access. 
     
      
    14 The effect of these two provisions appears to be that a restraining order can be obtained by an authorised officer on the basis of a reasonable suspicion in relation to any property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity (under par (a)) and in relation to any serious crime derived property, whoever the owner may be (under par (b)). There is obvious opportunity for the property of an innocent person to become subject to a restraining order. Assuming, in the case of the suspected criminal that the authorised officer has some reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property belongs to the criminal, the order will be made ex parte under par (a) and without hearing from others who may have a claim to ownership. In a case falling under par (b), it is likely that the officer will need to have grounds to connect the property with the suspect or else there would be no basis for concluding that it was serious crime derived property. But it will not be the property of the suspect. 
     
      
    15 Whether there is any scope for the innocent owner to recover his or her property absent an application under s 25 (discussed below), was the subject of consideration in New South Wales Crime Commission v Ollis (2006) 65 NSWLR 478, which rejected the availability of such a process: at [35] (Giles JA, Mason P agreeing). The procedural issue does not arise in the present case. However, the substantive issue of ownership does. Thus, Mr Liu was not a person suspected of a serious crime related activity: Ms Shi was. For the purposes of s 10(3)(b), if Mr Liu owned the cash, it should not have been the subject of a restraining order and should therefore not become the subject of an assets forfeiture order. However, to recover his cash, Mr Liu had to establish that he was entitled to an exclusion order under s 25 and thus prove, not merely that s 10(3)(b) did not apply, but that the money was not “illegally acquired property” in any relevant sense. The Commission contended that even if he did establish the money was his, he nevertheless failed because Mr Liu had, on his own evidence, brought at least part of the money into the country without making the relevant report of a transfer of currency under s 15 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). The correctness of this contention is not self-evident but, because the judgment below must stand, need not be determined. 
     
      
    16 The opportunity to apply for an exclusion order arises under s 25(1) of the Act which reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If an assets forfeiture order: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) has been applied for but not made — a person whose interest in property might be subject to the order if made, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) has been made — a person whose interest in property was forfeited by the order,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          may apply to the Supreme Court for an order (in this section called an  
          exclusion order 
          ) excluding the interest from the operation of the assets forfeiture order or any relevant restraining order.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 The present case fell within the first limb, in that the exclusion order was applied for before the assets forfeiture order had been made. The power of the Court to make an exclusion order arises by implication from the terms of s 25. Although sub-s 25(2) is stated in the form of a prohibition, it is clearly intended that an order should be made if the negative factors are excluded. Section 25(2) thus provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The Supreme Court must not make the exclusion order applied for unless it is proved that it is more probable than not that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in the case of an order relating to fraudulently acquired property — the interest in property to which the application relates is not fraudulently acquired property or is not illegally acquired property, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in any other case — the interest in property to which the application relates is not illegally acquired property.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 Subsection (3) requires that an exclusion order must “declare the nature and extent of the interest in property to which it relates”. Before the hearing of the application, the applicant is required to give the Commission “notice of the grounds on which the exclusion order is sought”: s 25(6). If the Commission intends to contest the application, it must give the applicant “notice of the grounds on which the application is to be contested”: s 25(7). However, that need not be done until the Commission has had an opportunity to examine the applicant, presumably as the owner of an interest in property, “concerning the affairs of the owner, including the nature and location of any property in which the owner has an interest”: s 12(1)(b). 
     
      
    19 Finally, in terms of the structure of the legislation, it is necessary to refer to the definition of “illegally acquired property”, being that which must be disproved by an applicant for an exclusion order under s 25(2). The term is defined by replacing the phrase “serious crime derived property” and substituting the phrase “illegally acquired property” and the phrase “illegal activity” for “serious crime related activity” in s 9: sub-s 9(4). As a result, s 9(1) would provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) An interest in property is illegally acquired property if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it is all or part of the proceeds of a [sic] illegal activity, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it is all or part of the proceeds of the disposal of or other dealing in illegally acquired property, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) it was wholly or partly acquired using illegally acquired property.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 The term “illegal activity” is itself defined, relevantly, to mean “an act or omission that constitutes an offence (including a common law offence) against the laws of New South Wales or the Commonwealth”: s 4(1) illegal activity, (b). 
     
      
    Commission’s application21 Before turning to the judgment the subject of this appeal, further reference is required in relation to the form of the application by the Commission for an assets forfeiture order. The summons of 15 April 2002 sought operative orders which fell within three categories. The first group sought separately in relation to each of Mr Liu, Ms Shi and Mr Guo restraining orders with respect to “the interest in property” held by each in the money. The second group constituted orders sought pursuant to s 10(4) that the Public Trustee take control of “all the interest of” each of the three persons in the money. The third sought asset forfeiture orders, again by reference to all the interests of each of the persons in the money. The formulation of orders in this form was somewhat curious: it was the Commission’s case that Mr Liu had no interest in the cash, but that if he did in fact own the cash it was not suspected on reasonable grounds of being serious crime derived property. For the money to satisfy that test, in the circumstances, it would have been the property of Ms Shi or, possibly, Mr Guo, but not Mr Liu. Those basic propositions were reflected in the notice of grounds filed by both Mr Liu and the Commission prior to the trial. 
     
      
    22 Because the affidavit in support of the s 10 application was not before this Court, it is not possible to know on what basis (if at all) an authorised officer asserted a suspicion on reasonable grounds that Mr Liu had an interest in the money the subject of the application. In any event, the restraining order was made on the basis that he did have such an interest. The Commission then maintained a somewhat ambivalent position by continuing to seek an assets forfeiture order in which it nominated Mr Liu as having an interest in the money and at the same time resisting his own attempt to obtain an exclusion order based on his interest in the money, the Commission arguing that he had none. Pursuant to s 22(2), the Court was required to make an assets forfeiture order if satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the person (Ms Shi) whose suspected serious crime related activity formed the basis of the restraining order was, at any time not more than six years before the making of the application for the assets forfeiture order, engaged in a serious crime related activity, relevantly, involving an indictable quantity of prohibited drugs. 
     
      
    23 In substance what happened in the present case at trial was that Mr Liu failed to establish his interest in the money and the money itself became the subject of an assets forfeiture order, despite some ambivalence as to who was the proper owner of it. Nevertheless, none of these matters was the basis of challenge to the order made on this appeal. Rather, the challenges were concerned entirely with the fact-finding exercise undertaken by Mathews AJ and in particular the failure to deal with particular evidence given by Mr Liu and the rejection of other parts of his evidence which were not challenged in cross-examination. 
     
      
    Material factual findings24 Briefly stated, Mr Liu’s account of the circumstances in which the money came to be in Ms Shi’s and Mr Guo’s apartment was that he had left it there on 25 October 2001, shortly prior to departing on a trip to China. The money had been acquired by him, in part from his legitimate business activities involving processing chicken meat in Australia, but mainly as a result of loans obtained from family and friends in China to invest in his business interests in Australia: Tcpt, 19/03/07, pp 14-15.  
     
      
    25 The particular purpose for which the money had been earmarked was the purchase of a chicken farm from a Mr Caruana at Redland Bay, in Queensland. A price had been fixed in July 2001 and Mr Liu said that he expected Mr Caruana to press for completion of the sale whilst he was overseas and hence left the matter, including the money, with Mr Guo to attend to in his absence. Mr Liu was in China between 25 October and 7 December 2001. During that time Mr Guo telephoned him and told him that he had been unable to sign the contract because he did not have, in effect, a power of attorney to act for Mr Liu. The chronology of events was concisely set out by her Honour in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[90] On 30 October 2001 Mr Liu left for China. He returned to Australia on 7 December 2001. At that time, on his own version, he knew that the contract had not been signed in his absence and therefore that the full $770,000 should still be at the Mount Street apartment. Mr Liu said that he tried to contact Mr Guo by telephone but was unable to get through to him. Mr Liu also said that on about 11 December he went to see his solicitor, Equiton, and signed the contract for the purchase of the Queensland poultry farm. For reasons I will mention later, I have real reservations as to whether it was on 11 December or later that Mr Liu signed this contract.  
        
       
       
        
        [91] Mr Liu said that on 14 December 2001 he read in a Chinese newspaper that Mr Guo had been arrested and was being held at an immigration detention centre. That day, 14 December, he went to see Mr Guo at the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre. It was then that he discovered that the $770,000 had been seized by police two days earlier. 
        
       
       
        
        [92] The same day, 14 December, he went to the solicitor who was representing Mr Guo, Rutland Cheung and made a statement setting out the history of the matter and claiming the $770,000 as his own money. 
        
       
       
        
        [93] On 19 December Mr Liu’s solicitor, Equiton, wrote to Mr Caruana’s solicitor enclosing a contract signed by Shi Wei and Mr Liu. The purchase price was $500,000 with a deposit of $25,000.” 
        
       
      
    26 Despite the seeming implausibility of the account, there were a number of aspects of the evidence which were supportive of its truth. If all had been accepted, an apparently implausible account would have been rendered persuasive and would probably have been accepted by the trial judge. However, each was attended by its own element of doubt which required, so far as the evidence permitted, to be resolved. In order to understand how her Honour assessed the evidence, it is necessary to outline briefly its key features. First, when the police searched the Mount Street premises and discovered the suitcase, Mr Guo indicated there was money in it but denied knowing the combination for the lock. He stated, as recorded in the taped record of conversation between Federal Agent Lisa Goodhand and the occupants of the premises (p 13): 
     
      
       
        
        “All this stuff definitely is not ours, its just sitting in the corner, so the number we don’t know, we haven’t written it down.” 
        
       
      
    27 After a further conversation, apparently in Mandarin, which Ms Goodhand spoke, she recorded the following statement (p 14): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Guo has indicated that there is an amount of money in these bags, we previously asked him if there was any other money in the house and he said yes in these suitcases. He said that the suitcase [sic] aren’t his, so we are going to take them into the lounge room and we are going to open them by force because we don’t have a lock number.” 
        
       
      
    28 Although Mr Guo immediately and consistently denied ownership of the money, it was said that he failed, until some time later, to disclose to whom it belonged. This, it might be inferred, followed his conversation with Mr Liu on 14 December 2001 whilst he was in immigration detention. On the other hand, the record of conversation between the police officers and Mr Guo and Ms Shi at the Mount Street apartment do not disclose any questioning as to the identity of the owner. 
     
      
    29 A second element which supported the account given by Mr Liu and Mr Guo as to the purpose for which the money was being held was the location in the apartment of at least the first page of a contract for the Redland Bay poultry farm, including a purchase price of $500,000 and details of the land, the solicitors for both parties and the identity of the purchaser, namely a company known as S&L International Enterprises Pty Ltd. Although there was no company search in evidence, it appears to have been common ground that the directors and shareholders of the company were Ms Shi and Mr Liu, although Mr Liu asserted that the share held by Ms Shi was held on trust for him. 
     
      
    30 There were a number of aspects of the search of the premises which might have been of assistance, but were simply unknown. Although Mr Guo gave evidence that Mr Liu counted the money in his presence when he delivered it, there was no information as to whether any attempt had been made to fingerprint the money. Further, although it was accepted that a copy of the contract was found in the apartment, it is not clear where it was found and no federal or state police officers engaged in the search gave evidence. 
     
      
    31 The fact that such a large sum of money was found in cash might be thought far more consistent with the money having been acquired though an illegal activity than with its presence for the purchase of a property in the ordinary course of lawful business dealings. However, her Honour referred to evidence that Mr Liu had borrowed an amount of approximately A$1.345 million in 2000 and 2001. Her Honour continued (at [17] and [18]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Virtually the whole of this money, he said, was kept in cash in his home. In China, he said, it is normal for people to keep their cash savings at home rather than in a bank. China is very much a cash economy and there is a reluctance to trust the banking system. There is also a strong desire for privacy concerning the level of savings which one holds. 
        
       
       
        
        Virtually all the Chinese witnesses in this case gave evidence to similar effect, and I do not understand it to be disputed by the Commission.” 
        
       
       
      Accordingly, her Honour drew no adverse inference from this circumstance. 
       
      
    32 There were, understandably, numerous subsidiary issues which arose in the course of the proceedings, including questions as to Mr Liu’s credibility. This was not assisted by the fact that he conceded, willingly it would appear, that most of the critical material in his protection visa application, going to establish his status as a person in Australia in need of protection under the Refugee Convention, was false. Similarly, on his own account, much of the money raised in China and brought back to Australia was not declared on entering Australia, although some amounts were declared. 
     
      
    33 The case, as her Honour dealt with it, turned on two issues. As her Honour stated at [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The real question is how much cash Mr Liu had in October 2001, this being relevant to (although not decisive of) the central issue in this case, namely whether the $769,300 seized on 12 December 2001 was in fact Mr Liu’s money.” 
        
       
      
    34 The second important issue was the purpose for which the money was said to be in Mr Guo’s Mount Street apartment on 12 December. Because there was no doubt that Mr Liu had an interest in purchasing the poultry farm at Redland Bay, prior to October 2001, and because Mr Guo also had some involvement in the proposed dealing, it was clear that the proposed dealing was genuine in many respects. Again, that was not in contention, the Commission having obtained a statement from Mr Caruana confirming that he had decided early in 2001 to sell the farm and that in both May and June he had conversations with Mr Liu in relation to the purchase. On one occasion in June 2001 he flew Mr Liu to Queensland to look at the property and on a later occasion in July 2001 Mr Caruana flew to Queensland and Mr Liu drove with others to meet him at Redland Bay. On his return to Sydney, Mr Caruana instructed his solicitor to prepare a contract for sale of the farm. 
     
      
    35 The issue which became critical in her Honour’s assessment of the proposed purchase was settling the date on which Mr Liu signed the contract. He gave evidence that he signed the contract at his solicitor’s office on 11 December 2001. Her Honour found it “most likely that it was not until 14 December or later that this in fact took place”: at [116]. Critically, the later time was after Mr Liu had spoken with Mr Guo and knew of the seizure of the money. Thus at [117] her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view the bulk of the evidence supports the proposition that, when Mr Liu signed this contract, he had already been told by Mr Guo about the seizure of the $769,300. Given the other evidence in the case, an inference can readily be drawn that he was signing the contract for the purpose of bolstering his claim to the seized money.” 
        
       
      
    36 Her Honour returned to that theme at [121] concluding: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the purchase of the poultry farm was thereafter resurrected for the purpose of providing an explanation as to why Mr Liu would leave such a large amount of money with Mr Guo.” 
        
       
      
    Findings in relation to Mr Liu’s financial resources37 Before considering the challenges made to the finding concerning the ‘resurrection’ of the poultry farm purchase, it is convenient to deal with her Honour’s factual findings in relation to Mr Liu’s financial resources. 
     
      
    38 Her Honour gave careful consideration to Mr Liu’s own evidence of his financial dealings, and particularly his borrowings in China, together with the supporting evidence of a number of the Chinese lenders: at [29]-[42]. Her Honour concluded “many if not all of these loans were in fact made to Mr Liu”: at [42]. In reaching that conclusion, she expressed doubts in respect of some of the evidence, but those doubts appear to have been resolved in favour of Mr Liu’s case and need not be revisited. Her Honour continued at [43]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[43] However, that is by no means the end of the matter. For there is a real question, assuming that these moneys were in fact received by him, as to how much he brought back into Australia.  
         
        … 
         
        [45] Mr Temby submits that I should not accept that all Mr Liu’s Chinese borrowings were brought back to Australia. In this regard he relies upon three separate matters, namely: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
           Mr Liu’s failure to make a custom’s declaration for most of these moneys 
           The inconsistencies in Mr Liu’s evidence relating to the dates and amounts which he says he brought into Australia 
           The evidence relating to Mr Liu’s business activities in China.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    39 In relation to the first two matters, her Honour set out briefly the evidence at [47]-[49] and [50], respectively. No specific findings were made in respect of these matters and they may therefore be put to one side. 
     
      
    40 The third matter was addressed in more detail as it involved evidence of the purchase of a factory near Shanghai. This was a matter of some significance, because the borrowings in China amounted to some $950,000, whereas the moneys available to Mr Liu, on his evidence, in Australia (other than the Chinese borrowings) could not have exceeded $833,000: see judgment below at [75]-[76]. As Mr Liu had outgoings in Australia in the order of $1 million, in relation to the purchase of property, plant and equipment, the expenditure of any significant sum on the purchase and establishment of a factory in Shanghai would cast doubt on the suggestion that sufficient Chinese borrowings were available to him in Australia in October 2001. Given that on the most generous arithmetical view, Mr Liu’s Australian borrowings (not being moneys brought in by him or his family between 1990 and 1999) amounted to $383,000, there would be serious doubt as to whether the evidence demonstrated that Mr Liu had cash resources in an amount of $770,000 as at October 2001. 
     
      
    41 It may be noted that although the figures which formed the basis of her Honour’s calculations at [75]-[79] resolved a number of doubts in favour of Mr Liu’s case, she did not take into account any moneys available to Mr Liu at that time from his businesses. However, his evidence was that although in October 2001 he had cash available from his businesses, the bulk of the $770,000 came from borrowings. Both he and his wife gave evidence that, in addition to the $770,000, there was an additional amount of cash in their home to cover the expenses of the businesses, in an amount probably between $30,000 and $50,000: Tcpt, 26/03/07, pp 281-282. 
     
      
    42 A letter from Mr Liu’s then solicitors dated 7 February 2002 seeking return of the cash from the Commission, evidence Mr Liu gave before the Registrar on 21 June 2002 pursuant to an examination ordered by the Court under s 12 of the Act, and affidavits filed in support of the claim in these proceedings, all stated that Mr Liu (with the assistance of his extended family) had established a substantial factory in Shanghai for which, it appeared, he had paid at least RMB1.5 million. (The solicitor’s letter stated a far higher figure.) At the accepted exchange rate, RMB1.5 million would have been equivalent to A$250,000. There was contrary evidence from Mr Liu before the Court to the effect that the cost of the factory had been met by the Chinese government and, although repayment might be needed from the profits of the business in due course, there had been no cash outlay by him. Her Honour dealt with this evidence at [65] in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence about the purported factory near Shanghai is relevant to this case in two respects. First, it is relevant to the question of whether Mr Liu brought back to Australia all of the moneys he borrowed in China. If, as the earlier evidence appeared to indicate, Mr Liu had major outgoings in relation to the purchase and operation of the Shanghai factory, then it would make it much more likely that a significant portion of the Chinese borrowings remained in that country. The second matter of relevance is that it goes to Mr Liu’s credibility. Given the strength of the earlier assertions, made by his solicitors, his sister and his brother-in-law, amongst others, to the effect that Mr Liu had in fact purchased a factory in or near Shanghai, it is very difficult to escape the conclusion that  
        either 
         the original assertion was false, and was designed to bolster Mr Liu’s apparent wealth by falsely claiming that he owned the Shanghai factory;  
        or alternatively 
        , that it was true, but he later wanted to distance himself from this evidence because of the likelihood that, if the Shanghai factory existed, some of the Chinese borrowings would probably have remained in that country.” 
        
       
      
    43 This was a matter to which her Honour did return in her conclusions, stating at [99]: 
     
      
       
        
        “A further piece of evidence which, in my view, reflected badly on Mr Liu’s credibility, related to the purported factory in Shanghai. … In my opinion the move away from the firm assertions that Mr Liu had purchased a factory in Shanghai reflects adversely upon his own credibility as well as that of a number of witnesses called on his behalf. It also supports the likelihood that a significant portion of the Chinese borrowings remained in that country.” 
        
       
      
    44 It appears from this last passage that although the conflicting stories impacted adversely on Mr Liu’s credibility, no clear finding could be made as to whether or not money was spent on a factory in Shanghai. 
     
      
    Conclusions in relation to financial resources45 The uncertainties concerning the amount of the loans available from friends and relatives in China, the amount brought back into Australia and the net amount available in Australia after allowing for known expenses, ultimately provided no more than background to the critical conclusion her Honour reached with respect to Mr Liu’s financial resources in October 2001. The key findings made by her Honour accepted the fact of the various borrowings, but as evidence of Mr Liu’s need for finance, particularly in order to purchase a property at 255 Railway Parade, Cabramatta in June 2000. Her Honour’s conclusions in this respect appear from the following paragraphs of her judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “[100] There is other evidence which supports the proposition that, at least in June 2000, Mr Liu did not have access to the cash reserves which he claimed. It will be recalled that, on 13 April 2000, Mr Liu and his wife entered into a contract to purchase 250 Railway Parade, Cabramatta for $800,000, of which $400,000 was to be financed by way of mortgage. A deposit of $40,000 had been paid, leaving outstanding an amount of $360,000 which Mr Liu needed to provide upon settlement. By June 2000 the matter had assumed some urgency, as a Notice to Complete was served upon him and his wife on 31 May 2000. The settlement in fact took place on 30 June 2000. Four days earlier, on 26 June, Mr Liu travelled to China where he remained for three days. During that time he made no less than seven borrowings, most of them from Zhang Ming Yuan. On 26 June Mr Liu borrowed RMB150,000 from Mr Zhang. The following day, 27 June, in five separate borrowings, he obtained a total of RMB690,000. Finally, on 28 June, he obtained a further RMB260,000 from Mr Zhang. Accordingly, the total amount borrowed during that brief visit was RMB1.1 million. Mr Zhang said that the reason why he made four separate loans to Mr Liu on 27 June was because Mr Liu kept coming back to him saying that he needed more money because he had not been able to raise enough money from others. I take this as a clear indication that Mr Liu’s need for money at that time was urgent. 
        
       
       
        
        [101] When Mr Liu returned to Australia on 29 June he declared that he was carrying with him $US150,000 ($A252,610). On the same day, 29 June, at Star City Pyrmont, Mr Liu converted foreign currency into A$136,099. The following day, as already mentioned, the purchase of 250 Railway Parade, Cabramatta was completed. 
        
       
       
        
        [102] The clear inference to be drawn from all this evidence is that Mr Liu had insufficient funds in Australia to enable him to complete the purchase of the Cabramatta property. Hence his trip to China, and his urgent requests to Mr Zhang for more money. This, however, is inconsistent with Mr Liu’s description of the cash funds which he had at his home, including the Chinese borrowings he had made before 26 June. Taking into account all the relevant outgoings already incurred by Mr Liu, the amount he would have had at home, if his other evidence were to be accepted, would have significantly exceeded the $360,000 he needed to complete the Cabramatta purchase. 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [104] If, as the above analysis suggests, Mr Liu was dependent upon his Chinese borrowings between 26 and 28 June to complete the Cabramatta purchase, it would appear virtually impossible that he could have had an amount in excess of $A770,000 in cash as at October 2001. His only borrowings after June 2000 were RMB500,000 borrowed in China in September 2000, and the Australian borrowings, between May and September 2001, which totalled $130,000 or possibly $230,000 (paras [66]-[75]) above.” 
        
       
      
    46 Four points may be noted in relation to this conclusion. First, the arithmetic is not easy to follow. If the equivalent of the US dollars was A$252,610, that would in turn have amounted to RMB1.5 million, not the RMB1.1 million referred to at [100]. (The difference is A$183,000.) Secondly, in assessing the funds available from Australian borrowings, it appears that her Honour has not accepted that Mr Liu had available to him in October 2001 cash in an amount of $153,000 raised by refinancing his home and the Cabramatta property in September 2000 and January 2001: see [21] and [76], the latter paragraph not being included in the earlier paragraphs cross-referenced at [104]. However, even if this amount were added to the calculation at [104] the total available cash would not exceed $470,000, some $300,000 short of the amount found in the Mount Street apartment. 
     
      
    47 Thirdly, her Honour referred at [103] to other evidence that Mr Liu was short of funds in 2000 and 2001, arising from cheques written in the course of his business which were dishonoured and the suggestion of Mr Caruana in a statement to which further reference will be made below, that Mr Liu was a “bad debtor”. This material tended to confirm the calculations undertaken, but the passages set out above would appear to stand on their own, without reliance on the further matters dealt with at [103]. 
     
      
    48 Fourthly, as will be noted shortly, her Honour spent some little time assessing the evidence relating to the purchase of the poultry farm from Mr Caruana. She had, at [79] identified this as “highly significant” and as “a very central issue in this case”. Despite this characterisation, her Honour’s views in relation to that matter do not appear to have significantly affected the assessment of available funds set out above. Indeed, the assessment of available funds was undertaken before her Honour turned to an assessment of the evidence concerning the purchase of the poultry farm. Accordingly, even if her Honour’s assessment of the poultry farm purchase was flawed, the Appellant faces a difficulty in succeeding on the appeal if her Honour’s finding at [104] cannot be shown to be erroneous.  
     
      
    49 Various challenges were made to her Honour’s assessment of the funds available to Mr Liu in October 2001. Some involved doubts raised by her Honour but not relied upon adversely to Mr Liu. Several seemed to reflect a supposed obligation on her Honour to make the findings most favourable to the Appellant on the available evidence. However, it is clear from reading the statements of witnesses and the transcript of the their oral evidence that locating the kernel of fact amongst numerous inconsistencies and explanations was often a fraught process. That other findings might have been open is insufficient to demonstrate error. More often than not, a reading of the evidence suggests that her Honour’s findings were generous to Mr Liu’s case. 
     
      
    50 In order to give credibility to his account of the affair, Mr Liu had to explain why the amount left with Mr Guo was $769,300, when the purchase price was $500,000; why, if he were anxious to proceed with the purchase and had the cash available he did not sign the contract himself; why, when the contract had not been signed or exchanged, and he expected to be away for no more than a month, he thought it necessary to leave the full purchase price with Mr Guo; why he did not leave full instructions (and possibly the money) with his solicitor; and why, if he were ready to proceed by way of exchange and immediate settlement, he made no attempt to contact Mr Caruana to advise him of that fact. No adverse findings were made in relation to these matters. 
     
      
    51 Another case of apparently incongruous conduct, which arose in relation to the proposed purchase of the poultry farm, concerned a detailed ‘management agreement’ entered into by Mr Liu with Mr Guo. One possible explanation for the written agreement was that it was intended to provide a basis for Mr Guo’s (and Ms Shi’s) involvement in the poultry farm as a counter to any inference that they were the source of part or all of the purchase moneys. That may have been thought important in circumstances where they, rather than Mr Liu, had access to large amounts of cash, but from illicit activities. No adverse finding was made on that basis. 
     
      
    52 One specific complaint which needs to be addressed was her Honour’s apparent failure to recognise that Mr Liu and Mr Guo were not the sole witnesses to the supposed transfer of funds from Mr Liu’s home to the Mount Street apartment. It was put that Mr Liu’s wife, Ms Wei Hou, gave evidence corroborating her husband. Her evidence, contained in an affidavit dated 11 October 2003, was to the following effect (par 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “Around the time Frank told me about buying the chicken farm he said words to the effect ‘I am going to buy the chicken farm with this money’. The money he was referring to was kept in the house in a large red bag made of some kind of fabric. He told me there was $770,000.00 in the bag for the purchase of the chicken farm. Some time later, Frank told me that he had taken the money for the purchase of the farm to Mr Guo’s house. He told me that after I learned that the Police had taken the money.” 
        
       
      
    53 Of that evidence, the Appellant complains that it was “highly significant” and was unchallenged. It was, however, not direct evidence of anything that Mr Liu did. It was evidence of what he told his wife he had done. Ms Wei was apparently not told the proposed purchase price for the poultry farm. It is clear that she did not have any direct knowledge of the amount contained in the bag. When asked about it in cross-examination, she said she could not remember the exact amount in the bag in 2001 but she remembered that there were “large amounts”: Tcpt, 26/03/07, p 282. 
     
      
    54 The trial judge did refer to the evidence of Ms Wei, but in relation to money said to have been brought to Australia by her from China, in the amount of $A350,000: at [13] and [75]. It is apparent that her Honour did not treat the evidence of her conversations with her husband as significantly advancing his claim. Understandably, her Honour gave more careful consideration to such objective circumstances in relation to Mr Liu’s financial resources as could be identified from the evidence. There was no attempt in this Court to suggest that weight had been placed on this particular corroborative statement of Ms Wei in the course of submissions. The fact that her Honour did not refer to it suggests she gave it no significant weight, probably because she was not asked to, an approach which, viewed in the context of the trial, would seem entirely reasonable. 
     
      
    55 Given that Mr Liu had the burden of proving that the cash found in the Mount Street apartment was his, his failure to establish that he had such an amount available to him in October 2001 must, in the absence of alternative evidence that the money could not have come from any other source, be fatal to his claim. In other words, establishing that such an amount was available to him, was a necessary, but not sufficient, condition of success: see [33] above. 
     
      
    The poultry farm purchase56 As noted above, there was uncontroverted evidence that, between approximately May and July 2001 Mr Liu was negotiating with Mr Caruana to purchase the poultry farm at Redland Bay. Further, both Mr Guo and Ms Shi were connected with the project. Mr Guo had visited Queensland with Mr Liu on at least one occasion to see the property. Ms Shi was a director of the company which was to purchase the property, namely S&L International Enterprises Pty Ltd (or possibly S&L Enterprises Pty Ltd). The question was whether any such proposal was still on foot in late October 2001 when Mr Liu was said to have left the money at the Mount Street apartment. 
     
      
    57 There were two aspects of the evidence which her Honour considered highly damaging to the proposition that the proposal was then still on foot. The first was a curiously detailed agreement dated 28 June 2001, purporting to make Mr Guo the manager of the farm and Ms Shi a general sales manager for the company which was to buy the farm. Her Honour thought it curious that, in a case in which significant financial dealings were dealt with on the basis of trust and not written documents, this agreement should have been reduced to writing: at [107]. Secondly, the date was curious because Mr Liu, in a document prepared on 14 December 2001 with Mr Guo’s solicitors, stated that he and Mr Guo had met in or around August 2001. Further, she noted that according to Mr Caruana, he and Mr Liu were still negotiating the transfer of the farm in July 2001: at [110]. Accordingly, her Honour held that it had been “drawn up later and deliberately backdated”: at [111]. 
     
      
    58 There were obvious inconsistencies in the evidence to which her Honour referred; however, they are not satisfactorily resolved by this conclusion. First, there is no doubt that the proposal to purchase the poultry farm was on foot in June 2001. Accordingly, whether the contract was entered into later and backdated to June says nothing, of itself, as to whether the proposal was still on foot in October. Secondly, if Mr Liu did first re-establish his acquaintance with Mr Guo in August 2001, rather than in June, as he said in his affidavit, that would render it more likely, rather than less likely, that the proposal was still on foot in October. Thirdly, it seems unlikely that if the agreement had been prepared later, it was prepared on or about 14 December 2001 when Mr Liu made his statement about meeting Mr Guo in August. If it had been made at that time, the disparity in the dates would probably have been appreciated. If, however, the handwritten agreement was prepared later, to give verisimilitude to the “resurrected” proposal, it would have made much sense to date it 25 October 2001, contemporaneously with the alleged delivery of the money to Mr Guo’s apartment, rather than backdate it to 28 June when, for other reasons, there was objective evidence to support the proposed purchase. 
     
      
    59 Whatever the truth of the matter, the existence of the written agreement signed by Mr Liu and Mr Guo says little about the continued intention of Mr Liu to purchase the farm in October 2001. 
     
      
    60 The second matter is more significant and relates to the disparity between the amount of the cash found at the Mount Street apartment ($769,300) and the purchase price of the farm, namely $500,000. Mr Liu sought to explain the disparity by reference to the need for working capital and because he was “boasting my wealth” in leaving the money with Mr Guo. The former explanation had some credibility, because Mr Caruana stated that he had started to run the farm down from March 2001 and that the plant and equipment then on it was not to be part of the sale. The latter explanation her Honour considered to be inconsistent with Chinese custom of protecting one’s privacy by not revealing the extent of one’s wealth: at [112]. 
     
      
    61 Her Honour’s findings in relation to what happened on or about 14 December 2001, at [117] and [121], have been set out at [35] and [36] above. They are, in effect, that, upon learning of the seizure of the money, Mr Liu set about creating a false basis for claiming the money to be his by resurrecting the proposal for the poultry farm which he had earlier abandoned. This he did by taking a number of steps including signing the contract. Although he gave evidence that he had signed the contract at his solicitor’s office on 11 December 2001, before the police raid at Mount Street and before he learned, on 14 December, of the seizure of the money, her Honour rejected that evidence. However, on the appeal, Mr Liu challenged those findings. 
     
      
    62 At [116] her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Caruana’s account is at odds with Mr Liu’s evidence in a number of respects. Mr Liu said that it was on 11 December 2001 that he went to his solicitors, Equiton, and signed the contract for the purchase of the farm. However, I think it most likely that it was not until 14 December or later that this in fact took place. Mr Caruana said that when he met with Mr Liu in December 2001, Mr Liu already knew about the problems with the police. This must have been on or after 14 December. It was on that day that they agreed upon the $25,000 deposit, which was the deposit specified in the contract signed by Mr Liu.” 
        
       
      
    63 The disparities noted depend on two facts. One was that the contract as signed by Mr Liu contained the amount of the deposit which was 5% of the purchase price. The amount was handwritten. 
     
      
    64 Her Honour’s conclusion presupposes either that Mr Liu would not have signed the contract unless the deposit were specified, or that he would not have entered an amount for the deposit unless it had been agreed with Mr Caruana. These inferences may be correct, but they are by no means self-evident. Further, Mr Caruana stated that, in effect, it was Mr Liu who had proposed the amount of the deposit: statement at paragraph 29.  
     
      
       
        
        “About December 2001 I received a phone call from Frank [Mr Liu]. … Frank said words to the effect ‘I am back in Australia and I want to meet with you’. I said words to the effect, ‘I need money for the deposit otherwise there will be no deal’. Frank said words to the effect ‘I want to go ahead with the deal. I will get a deposit for you, I will give you 5%’.” 
        
       
      
    65 The second discrepancy relied upon by her Honour was that Mr Caruana stated that he had met with Mr Liu on the same day as their telephone conversation at which stage Mr Liu was aware of the seizure of the money by the police.  
     
      
    66 Acceptance of Mr Caruana’s statement as to the concurrence of the telephone conversation and the meeting on the same day might have been subject to some hesitation. The statement was obtained by Australian Federal Police officers, but the Commission did not seek to call the officers or Mr Caruana, nor rely upon his statement. Mr Liu tendered the statement, but no one called Mr Caruana to test its accuracy. The statement was obtained on 18 September 2002. At that stage he was clearly uncertain as to dates and was unable to date the phone call or the meeting. If he addressed the substance of the statement with care, it was not apparent from the content. For example, he stated at paragraph 32: 
     
      
       
        
        “I incurred losses given that because I thought Frank was going to purchase the property I ordered that the stock levels be minimised and the winding down of the business. At no time, however, did I consider pursuing legal costs from Frank for losses incurred by the failure of this contract to proceed.” 
        
       
       
      That attitude was not consistent with earlier passages in his statement that his first conversation with Mr Liu had been in May 2001 (par 14) and that he had already ordered his son who was managing the farm to wind the business down in March (par 13). 
       
      
    67 Further, Mr Caruana’s statement was in other parts supportive of Mr Liu’s case. Mr Caruana said he rang Mr Liu on a number of occasions, without success, but on one occasion was told by his wife that he was in China (par 28). He then called China but the person who answered the phone could not speak English and he failed to make contact with Mr Liu. That must have been in November 2001. Accordingly, Mr Caruana was actively pursuing the proposed sale after 25 October 2001. 
     
      
    68 There is a further basis on which her Honour’s finding was challenged on appeal, namely that it had not been put to Mr Liu that he did not sign the contract on 11 December but only after he had learned of the seizure of the money on 14 December. The Commission’s position at trial appears from the following cross-examination (Tcpt, 23/03/07, p 231): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You signed this contract after you had returned from China on 7 December 2001 didn’t you? 
         
        A. I went to sign a document on 11 November 2001 … . 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You just mentioned the date, 11 November 2001, you meant of course 11 December 2001 didn’t you. 
         
        A. Yes, December … . 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say that you signed a contract relating to the Redland Bay chicken farm on 11 December 2001? 
         
        A. I think maybe this – probably this contract was signed earlier. I remember I signed a contract on 11 December and that the solicitor knew that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And I put it to you that the first contract you signed concerning purchase of the Redland Bay chicken farm was on 11 December 2001? 
         
        … 
         
        Q. I am putting to you sir that the first contract you signed for the purchase of the Redland Bay chicken farm was on 11 December 2001. What do you say? That’s true isn’t it?” 
        
       
      
    69 It was also submitted that the Commission had not suggested to Mr Liu that his evidence in that regard was a concoction. In terms, that also appears to be correct. The closest that the Commission came was in the final three questions and answers in his cross-examination (Tcpt, p 255): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I put to you that the money seized from Guo’s house was not yours, but either his or his wife’s or theirs, what do you say? 
         
        A. What you have said is incorrect. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I put it to you that at least part of the money that was seized from Guo’s place was not yours? 
         
        A. That’s not correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And finally, I put it to you that you have agreed those others wish to recover their money and have therefore brought these proceedings? 
         
        A. That’s incorrect.” 
        
       
      
    70 There is no doubt that the Commission’s case was that the money did not belong to Mr Liu and was probably not intended to be used for purchase of the chicken farm. However, the Court was not taken to any specific suggestion in evidence or submissions that the contract was not signed by Mr Liu on or about 11 December 2001 and in particular prior to 14 December. It may be noted that the contract was at some stage signed by Ms Shi, as a director of the company, although the evidence appears to be silent as to when that occurred. (Ms Shi was taken into custody on 12 December on drug charges and, given the allowance made in her sentencing for four months and three days spent in custody from 12 December 2001, must have remained in that custody until April 2002.) The contract signed by Shi and Liu was sent to the solicitors for Mr Caruana on 20 December 2001. 
     
      
    71 There is, of course, no doubt that the amount of almost $770,000 was found in the Mount Street apartment, as was a copy of the contract (unsigned) for the purchase of the poultry farm. The police had also found in the apartment a copy of a contract, signed and executed, but not completed, for the purchase of premises at Amalfi Drive, Isle of Capri, on the Queensland Gold Coast. There was no evidence that Mr Liu was associated with that purchase, the contract and receipt being in the name of Ms Shi. There was apparently a proposal to buy the property for the purpose of running a brothel, a business with which Ms Shi apparently had some experience. Part of the Commission’s case, though not the subject of any express finding by her Honour, was that the money was the proceeds of drug dealing by Ms Shi and was intended to be used for the purchase of the Almalfi Drive property. Whatever the truth of the matter, based on the cross-examination of Mr Liu and the manner in which the Commission’s case was presented, it was not appropriate for her Honour to conclude, adversely to Mr Liu, that the proposal to purchase the poultry farm had been abandoned by 25 October 2001 and resurrected only on 14 December 2001 as a false basis for Mr Liu to claim ownership of the money. Mr Liu’s claim in respect of the money should not have been rejected for that reason. 
     
      
    Conclusions72 Despite the successful challenge in relation to her Honour’s findings with respect to the poultry farm, it is clear that for the entirely separate reason noted above, namely that he did not have such a sum available to him in October 2001, her Honour was not persuaded that the money was the property of Mr Liu. Accordingly, the exclusion order was properly refused and, for that reason, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    73 It is unnecessary in those circumstances to consider the contention raised by the Commission, namely that if the money located at the Mount Street apartment was indeed that of Mr Liu, part at least had been brought into the country without the completion of an appropriate declaration, and thus in contravention of s 15 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act. The Commission argued that the money was “illegally acquired property” because it was the “proceeds of”, or “acquired by” an illegal activity, namely an omission to declare the moneys, being an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. There is some awkwardness in concluding that the language in the Act is satisfied in those circumstances. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Jeffrey v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (1995) 79 A Crim R 514 at 524 (Cole JA, Handley JA and Giles AJA agreeing), a case in which US currency was obtained in Australia in breach of the then Cash Transaction Report Act 1988 (Cth) and was held to have been “derived” from an illegal activity. The Court also noted that “‘derived’ is different to ‘acquired’” for the purposes of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth) at p 523. Jeffrey may well be distinguishable. However, in the circumstances, Mr Liu not having established that the property was his, there is no need to pursue that issue further. 
     
      
    74 The appeal should be dismissed with costs.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 CK and TS pleaded guilty to the offence of Manslaughter by an Unlawful and Dangerous Act at the Griffith Children's Court on 13 July 2007 and 26 June 2007 respectively. When arraigned at the Supreme Court on 17 September 2007 they each adhered to that plea. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The offenders are to be sentenced on the basis of a statement of facts which has become Exhibit C in these proceedings. On the evening of Sunday 31 December 2006, a New Year's Eve function was held at Lake Wyangan on the outskirts of Griffith. This was a community function which catered for both adults and those under 18. Patrons under 18 were required to wear a wrist band to show that they could not be served alcohol. Security officials and police were in attendance at this function. Buses had been organised to take patrons to the party and to bring them back to the main street of Griffith that night and in the early hours of the morning of Monday 1 January 2007. 
     
      
    3 The deceased, AF, was a 17-year-old youth who lived in a town outside Griffith and attended high school in Griffith. He had gone to the party with a group of friends of the same age. AF and some of his friends travelled back into Griffith by car after they had attended the party. 
     
      
    4 CK and TS also attended the party. They were both aged 15 years as at 1 January 2007. CK resided in Griffith and attended school there so he was well-known to a number of people. TS resided in Narrandera, a town 80 km to the east of Griffith, however he was friendly with people in Griffith and came to the town regularly. 
     
      
    5 TS and CK met with other young people at the home of a friend. They consumed alcohol at this house before they left to catch the bus to the party at Lake Wyangan. Some patrons at the party described CK as acting aggressively while at the party. Others described him at other times during the party acting as a peacemaker. After they had finished at the party, CK and TS caught the bus back into the main street of Griffith with other people in their group and were assembled near the taxi rank in Banna Avenue, the main street of Griffith. 
     
      
    6 AF travelled back from the party into town by car with his group of friends. They parked in Banna Avenue and a short while later AF left with one of the young men, AK, to drive another friend home. AF and AK then returned to Banna Avenue shortly before 3 a.m., parked the car and were walking up towards the taxi rank to meet with others in their group who were standing and sitting in the area of a bench seat. 
     
      
    7 CK and TS were with a group of youths, both male and female near the chain fence dividing Banna Avenue from the park. Witnesses stated that CK was walking up and down in the area of the taxi rank. This was close to the area where AF’s friends had gathered. AF walked past this group with AK towards his friends. AK heard someone say ""look at that cockhead"". He turned and looked and saw that the person who made this comment had a distinctive hairstyle, short at the side and long in the middle with a “rats tail” at the back. AK knew this person by a nickname as they attended the same school in Griffith. The name and a description accords with the offender CK.  
     
      
    8 AF and AK walked past this group towards their friends. CK approached AF and said something to the effect of ""what's your staring problem"". AF replied that he did not have a problem. The offender CK then grabbed AF and head-butted him with some force to the forehead. There are witnesses who stated that CK then head-butted AF a second time, however other witnesses reported only one head-butt. AF then started to stumble backwards and was seen to have blood on his forehead. 
     
      
    9 As CK turned and went to walk away, another young male who was known to onlookers as TS punched AF to the head. There are witnesses who stated that TS punched AF a second time before following CK. A third male was in the vicinity and some onlookers stated that the third male also punched AF to the head. However, the available evidence is not sufficient to allow this person to be reliably identified. 
     
      
    10 AF took a few steps across the road and then collapsed. CK and TS had left the area and were walking away when a witness heard CK say words to the effect of ""this is the way we roll, don’t fuck with me"". Another witness heard him say ""I’m CK, that's how we roll in this town"". 
     
      
    11 Police and ambulance attended the scene in Banna Avenue. AF was unable to be revived and life was pronounced extinct at Griffith Base Hospital at 3:50 a.m. on 1 January 2007. A post mortem revealed that AF had died as the result of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. 
     
      
    12 CK and TS went to the home of a relative and later the next day, they attended Griffith police station voluntarily and were charged on 2 January 2007. Both have remained in custody since that date.  
     
      
    13 I pause to observe that, in terms of the objective gravity of this offence, it matters little that the offenders each inflicted violence upon the victim once or twice. The real gravamen of the offence lay in this entirely senseless, unprovoked, callous assault upon a young man, minding his own business in the company of his friends, in a public place. CK was, in my view, spoiling for a fight and TS joined in. The offenders’ physical size and strength belies their age. That they could deliberately inflict harm upon another young man, who like them, had family waiting at home to see him, a future to look forward to, a life full of promise, for absolutely no reason at all, beggars belief. 14 They will, at some stage, be returning to their families. They will have hopefully productive lives to lead, milestones to reach. The victim’s parents, his family and friends, are forever deprived of the enjoyment and pride that AF’s life would have undoubtedly provided. The victim impact statement provided by AF’s mother and father is eloquent of this loss. As they clearly recognize, “no punishment, no matter how draconian can assuage [that] sense of loss or allay [their] frustration” (Ex F). Some attempt must be made however, to mark the objective gravity of the offence, constituted by the unlawful taking of a human life, with a sentence that reflects the principles of punishment, retribution, deterrence, protection of the community, and the rehabilitation of the offenders. 
     
      
    15 Whilst the starting point in this sentencing exercise is the unlawful taking of a human life, the sentence to be imposed at law is constrained by the basis upon which the plea has been entered. The law demands that the offenders be sentenced for an offence that is, objectively speaking, at the lower end of the available range, the upper limit of which is the maximum penalty. That maximum penalty encompasses a very broad range of manslaughter offences, including manslaughter offences that would otherwise be characterised as murder, but for the presence of a mental illness in the offender, or provocation, or excessive self-defence.  
     
      
    16 It should also be understood that, as juveniles, the offenders are nevertheless to be sentenced according to law. The common law principles that are applicable to proceedings involving juvenile offenders have been the subject of comment by this Court on numerous occasions. They find their statutory expression in section 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 :- 
     
      
       
        
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles:  
         
        (a)  
         
        that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them,  
         
        (b)  
         
        that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance,  
         
        (c)  
         
        that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,  
         
        (d)  
         
        that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home,  
         
        (e)  
         
        that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind.  
        
       
      
    17 As was observed by the Court in R v Voss [2003] NSWCCA 182, these principles do not mandate a lesser sentence than that which would be imposed upon an adult for an offence of the same kind. They do however, justify a greater emphasis upon the rehabilitation of the offenders, than upon general deterrence, although the role that deterrence plays in the sentencing exercise is not to be completely discounted . 
     
      
    18 I turn to the subjective circumstances of each offender. 
     
      
    19 CK has a criminal history commencing in June 2006 with an Aggravated Break and Enter in Company, Larceny and two counts of Escape Police Custody. The offender received a bond (without conviction) for 12 months, conditional upon supervision from Juvenile Justice, including anger management and further education as directed. The offence for which he stands to be sentenced was therefore committed whilst on conditional liberty and manifests a failure on the part of the offender to address his anger management issues. 
     
      
    20 CK is the youngest of two children to parents who are now separated and have both been in further relationships. The offender has regular contact with his parents, although he has not resided with either of them on a full-time basis since he was about 5 years of age. He has at various times lived intermittently with his father and mother, but his principal caregiver has been his paternal grandmother, with whom he enjoys a close relationship. She continues to provide support to the offender and indicated in a letter to the Court that the offender appears to be making gains whilst in detention. The offender is furthering his education and participating in the sporting programs offered by the Baxter Juvenile Justice Centre. The offender has demonstrated a real talent in both football codes and has represented his school at State level. His sporting prowess is well known in the community. 
     
      
    21 The offender has expressed his remorse in relation to the offence in his conversations with his grandmother and with the Juvenile Justice officer responsible for preparing the report, which is before the Court as Exhibit D. He has admitted to drinking alcohol and using cannabis prior to the offence and accepts responsibility for it, although he claims he had never meant to hurt anybody. I take this to mean that he did not intend the consequences of his actions, rather than that he did not intend to cause some harm to the victim. He clearly requires ongoing drug and alcohol counselling and further attempts at anger management. He has undertaken counselling in these areas whilst in custody. 
     
      
    22 CK reports using cannabis a few times a week from the age of 13 years, growing to daily use by Year 9. He claims to have also tried amphetamines, crystal methamphetamine, cocaine and benzodiazepine, although he denies any regular use of these substances. He began consuming alcohol at the age of 14 and generally used alcohol on weekends with his peers. In the opinion of the psychologist responsible for the preparation of a report, being Exhibit 3, the offender has limited insight into his cannabis use, claiming that he can cease at any time. Relevantly, the psychologist expressed the following opinion in relation to the offender's prospects of rehabilitation :- 
     
      
       
        
        in terms of recidivism, [CK's] most significant risk factor is his impulsivity. Furthermore, his immaturity and adverse social circumstances render him susceptible to future substance abuse problems, peer influence and also a likely progression towards more antisocial behaviours. He requires consistent therapeutic intervention for the duration of any custodial term he receives, but also ongoing support to assist with his reintegration into the community. Without the focus of football and consistent support in the community, I believe [CK’s] trajectory will decline, and he will likely progress into the adult jail system. 
        
       
      
    23 TS has no criminal history. This offender is the product of a fleeting relationship between his mother and a man who now resides in Wagga who has never acknowledged his paternity. The offender's mother has since had five other children to different partners. TS considers these siblings as brothers and sisters and demonstrates a high level of support and care towards them. He professes no desire to have any contact with his father. 
     
      
    24 TS's early life was generally stable but periodically traumatic. Shortly after his birth, his mother left the offender in the care of her parents in Narrandera. They raised the offender until his teenage years, when he went to live with an aunt in Griffith. This move followed a motor vehicle accident in which the offender's grandmother was seriously injured. The offender remained with his aunt for a period of six months, then returned to Narrandera to live with his grandparents. At about this time, the offender's mother returned to that town and the offender's behaviour began to deteriorate. He was suspended from high school and went back to Griffith to live with another aunt. Following an incident with a teacher at Griffith High School he was also suspended from that school in August 2006. At the time of the offence, TS was living between Griffith and Narrandera during the school holidays. 
     
      
    25 The offender began drinking alcohol at 14 years of age on weekends with a group of friends and has also experimented with cannabis. On the night of the offence TS had in fact been taken home from the party by security guards, when they saw him with a quantity of alcohol. Despite being told by his auntie to stay at home, TS jumped the back fence and returned to the party. TS also expressed his remorse through the Juvenile Justice officer, the author of a report from Duffy Robilliard, psychologists (Exhibit 1) and a testimonial under the hand of a family friend (Exhibit 2).  
     
      
    26 Since being in custody, TS has adjusted well to the environment, with very few entries reporting any negative or disruptive behaviour. He has received regular counselling from a Department psychologist and seems to be benefiting from that intervention. He continues to enjoy the support of a large family network. His prospects of rehabilitation appear to me to be more promising than his co-offender. 
     
      
    27 Counsel appearing on behalf of the offenders have referred me to a number of comparable cases, the most relevant of which are R v O’Hare [2003] NSWSC 652, R v LAL & PN [2007] NSWSC 445 and R v KT [2007] NSWSC 83. Each of these sentences at first instance involved a juvenile or youthful offender pleading guilty to manslaughter by an unlawful and dangerous act, being the infliction of one or more blows to the victim. Each of them also displayed impulsive acts of violence in circumstances where the victim was unknown to the offenders. I accept the range for full time terms of imprisonment extracted by the Chief Judge at Common Law in R v LAL & PN. 
     
      
    28 For this offence, aggravated as it is by the fact that it was committed in company, I regard a sentence of 6 years imprisonment as appropriate to the objective and subjective features, after the application of a 25% discount in each case for the early pleas of guilty. I accept that a finding of special circumstances is warranted, primarily because both offenders demonstrate a need for ongoing lengthy supervision and counselling after their release from custody. There is very little to distinguish the offenders in terms of criminality, although CK was undoubtedly the instigator and was subject to a bond at the time of the offence. For these reasons, I am of the view that he requires a longer period in custody than TS. 
     
      
    29 CK would you please stand. On the offence of Manslaughter, you are convicted. I sentence you to a non parole period of 4 years, to date from 2 January 2007, to expire 1 January 2011, with a balance of term of 2 years, expiring 1 January 2013. You are eligible to be released at the expiration of the non parole period. Pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, I direct that your sentence be served in a juvenile justice centre. I further direct that your supervision whilst on parole be undertaken by the Probation and Parole Service. 
     
      
    30 TS would you please stand. On the offence of Manslaughter, you are convicted. I sentence you to a non parole period of 3 years and 6 months, to date from 2 January 2007, to expire 1 July 2010, with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months, expiring 1 January 2013. You are eligible to be released at the expiration of the non parole period. Pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, I direct that your sentence be served in a juvenile justice centre. I further direct that your supervision whilst on parole be undertaken by the Probation and Parole Service.

    4 The respondent was charged with the following offences:- 
     
      
       
        
        1. On 7 November 2005 at Fairfield Heights, he maliciously damaged a window with intent to cause bodily injury to Sabah Aziz, by means of explosives, contrary to the provisions of s.196(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 14 years. 
         
         
        2. On 7 November 2005 at Fairfield Heights, he maliciously damaged a window, the property of Sabah Aziz, by means of explosives, contrary to the provisions of s.195(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        3. On 7 November 2005 at Fairfield Heights, he maliciously damaged the door, the property Sabah Aziz, by means of explosives, contrary to the provisions of s.195(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900. 
         
         
        4. On 7 November 2005 at Fairfield Heights, he had possession of an explosive article with intent to maliciously damage the property of another person contrary to the provisions of s.200(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for seven years. 
         
         
        5. On 7 November 2005 at Fairfield, he maliciously damaged a window, the property of another, namely, Alex Abraham, by means of explosives contrary to the provisions of s.195(b) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . 
        
       
      
    5 On 4 June 2007, the jury found that the respondent was not guilty of Count 1 and guilty of each other offence. 
     
      
    6 On 16 July 2007, his Honour sentenced the respondent as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (a) On each of Counts 4 and 5, concurrent non-parole periods of nine months commencing on 7 November 2005 and expiring on 6 August 2006, with a balance of term of nine months commencing on 7 August 2006 and expiring on 6 May 2007. 
       
       
      (b) On each of Counts 2 and 3, concurrent non-parole periods of 12 months commencing on 7 August 2006 and expiring on 6 August 2007, with a balance of term of 18 months commencing on 7 August 2007 and expiring on 6 August 2009. 
       
      
    7 The sentencing judge directed that the respondent be released to parole on 6 August 2007. A finding of special circumstances was made by reason of the accumulation of the sentences. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    8 The factual circumstances were accurately summarised in paragraphs (6) to (8) of the Crown’s written submissions which it is convenient to reproduce:- 
     
      
       
        
        “6. … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          In October 2004 Dr Sabah Aziz who was a dentist, filled a tooth for the respondent at his surgery; on two later occasions in 2004 he performed minor corrective work for the respondent without further charge; the respondent asked Dr Aziz to remove a sound tooth and Dr Aziz refused to do so. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On 19 March 2005, in an aggressive mood, the respondent returned to Dr Aziz’s surgery, opening the door forcefully, and argued with Dr Aziz, complaining about his workmanship and Dr Aziz’s lack of professionalism. He threatened Dr Aziz saying something like ‘You wait and fucking see, you will not get away with this’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Some time before 3 a.m. on Monday 7 November 2005 while Dr Aziz and his family were asleep upstairs, the respondent taped to the window of a downstairs sitting room a mortar device, which was a firework designed for use in the pipe. If set off when not in the pipe, its behaviour was unpredictable, and people nearby could suffer serious injury, including losing a limb, and people within 5 metres would suffer temporary, and perhaps permanent, hearing loss and perhaps damage to their eyes. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Between 2.45 a.m. and 2.55 a.m. that day the respondent lit the device and it exploded, breaking two panes of glass and waking the family. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The police were called, and, because the family feared that someone was downstairs inside the house, they waited in an upstairs bedroom until the police arrived. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Count 5: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The respondent then went to 10 Polding Street North, less than 2 kilometres from Dr. Aziz’s house and taped another mortar device to a bedroom window in a home occupied by the Yurchenko family and at about 3 a.m. or a few minutes past exploded it; no damage was done to the window. The respondent set off the mortar device there as a decoy to allow him time to place and set off a larger device at Dr Aziz’s surgery, and possibly in an attempt to shift suspicion from himself. 
          
         
         
          
          Count 3: 
          
         
         
          
          The respondent then drove to Dr Aziz’s surgery in The Boulevard, Fairfield, about 500 metres from Dr Aziz’s home where he attached another larger mortar, 75 millimetres or larger, to the door and exploded it; the explosion caused damage to the surgery door. 
          
         
         
          
          Count 4: 
          
         
         
          
          The respondent entered his Porsche car and sped off down Station Street, heading towards Sackville Street. Police officers pursued the car and saw it pass through a red light as it turned into Sackville Street; he was stopped in Polding Street. Police officers saw a jerry can in the car and arrested the respondent. During a search of a car police officers found two 65 millimetre mortars in a plastic bag behind the passenger’s seat and next to it a plastic bag containing four drink bottles of petrol. On the back seat police officers found fire blankets and homemade protective devices including a cap lined on the inside with foil and other items made out of foil; he had the fire blankets and protective devices to protect him from the possible consequences of setting off the mortar devices. Police officers also found gloves, which the respondent had for protection and in order not to leave fingerprints. 
          
         
         
          
          When he was searched, police officers found that the respondent was wearing a homemade protective device around his groin, to protect his genitals from damage should anything go wrong while he was committing the offences. 
          
         
         
          
          At a search at the respondent’s home that afternoon, police officers found mortars similar to those found in his car and protective devices, including a vest like device which he had designed to test as a protective device when letting off the mortars at his home. 
          
         
         
          
          About two weeks before the commission of the offences a neighbour had heard explosive like sounds from the respondent’s home and on one occasion saw a flash occur there; the respondent had set off some mortar devices at his home before the commission of the offences. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        7. The offences were committed at a time when the respondent must have appreciated that people were likely to be inside each of the two houses but he chose a time when there would be few people out and about in the streets, in order to avoid detection. 
        
       
       
        
        8. Extensive amounts of debris were found after the explosions; repairs to Dr Aziz’s house and surgery cost over $11,000.” 
        
       
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    9 The respondent was born in France on 20 August 1956. He was aged 50 years at the date of sentence. He had migrated to Australia when he was nine years old. He had had a supportive family and obtained a degree in Civil Engineering from the University of New South Wales. At the time of the commission of the offences he was working as a consultant project manager in the building industry. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge found that, at the time of the offences, there was no credible evidence that he was suffering from any mental illness. His Honour accepted that, during his time in custody, the respondent had learned a salutary lesson and that his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonable and that it was likely that he would not re-offend. 
     
      
    11 The respondent had a moderate criminal history, including a conviction for maliciously destroying property and he was at conditional liberty for that offence at the time of the commission of the offences in question in these proceedings. 
     
      
       
      Crown submissions on appeal 
       
      
    12 The Crown submitted that:- 
     
      
       
      • The offences were of considerable gravity involving explosive devices capable of causing significant damage. 
       
       
      • The offences involved a considerable amount of planning and preparation. 
       
       
      • The explosive devices were described as mortar devices, a form of fireworks (described by senior counsel for the Crown in this appeal as each being in the nature of a salute or large rocket with a wick). The devices could not be purchased legally in New South Wales without appropriate authority. 
       
       
      • The offences were aggravated and rendered more serious by reason of the fact that they were committed whilst the respondent was on conditional liberty: s.21A(2)(j) of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      . 
       
       
      • The respondent’s record of convictions including the conviction for maliciously destroying property. It was said that this demonstrated a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. Retribution, deterrence and protection of society indicated a more severe penalty was warranted (s.21A((2)(d) of the above Act). 
       
       
      • The offences involved planning and organised criminal activity in the respondent having purchased the mortar devices and experimented with such devices at his home. 
       
       
      • He committed the offence at the house occupied by the Yurchenko family as a decoy to allow him time to place and explode a mortar device at the surgery of Dr Aziz. 
       
       
      • The devices were exploded at a time when people were likely to be inside both houses (s.21A(2)(n) of the above Act). 
       
      
    13 The Crown also relied upon the fact that the offences were committed at night and that two of the offences were committed at the homes of the victims who had a right to feel safe, particularly in their own homes at night: Regina v Campbell [2000] NSWCCA 157 at [22] per Dunford J. 
     
      
    14 The Crown also pointed to the motivation for the offences in Counts 2 and 3 as ill-will which was described by the sentencing judge as “irrational”. 
     
      
    15 The Crown submitted that the matters of aggravation meant that the offences were of significant gravity and that his Honour was in error in finding them to fall at the lower end of the range of seriousness. 
     
      
    16 The Crown contended that the sentencing judge gave too much weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances and, accordingly, failed to impose sentences that properly reflected the objective seriousness of the offences: Regina v Hayes [2001] NSWCCA 358 at [51] per Sully J and Regina v Rushby (1977) 1 NSWLR 594, 597D-598E per Street CJ. The objective circumstances were, in the Crown submission, given disproportionate weight to the objective circumstances. 
     
      
    17 Finally, the Crown submitted that the sentencing judge failed properly to fix an appropriate sentence for each of the offences for which the respondent fell to be sentenced or to properly consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45]. It was also contended that his Honour failed to take into account that there were more victims than one and a failure to take into account the total criminality of the offences. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    18 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the sentencing judge was entitled to determine that the offences fell towards the lower end of the range of seriousness. 
     
      
    19 The respondent contended that the sentencing judge had heard extensive evidence concerning the fireworks from specialists during the course of the trial and was aware that no person was likely to have been present at the dentist’s surgery. Further, reliance was placed upon the fact that the actual danger presented by the ignition of the fireworks, given that it was at a time of day when few people, if any, would be likely to be in the vicinity, accordingly, limited the actual danger arising from the timing of the explosions. 
     
      
    20 On the question of accumulation of the sentences, it was submitted that, in all the circumstances and given the two groups of “victims”, that it was open to the sentencing judge to structure the sentences in the way that he did. The overall total accumulation of the first group of offences upon the second, it was said, reflected the appropriate principles and criminality and also reflected appropriately the totality in all the circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    21 The common law principles application to Crown appeals are well known and were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in Regina v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. In general terms, the discretion of the sentencing judge will only be interfered with in a compelling case. It is not sufficient that this Court would have imposed a more severe sentence: Regina v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 78. In the present appeal, it is necessary for the Crown to establish that the sentences imposed by Sides DCJ were outside the permissible range of the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    22 Senior counsel for the Crown on this appeal acknowledged that the sentencing judge had appropriately said in his remarks on sentence that the explosive devices in question were used to frighten, rather than to kill. The jury had clearly found, in relation to the first count, in relation to which they returned a verdict of not guilty, that they did not accept that there was an intention in the respondent to harm any person. 
     
      
    23 The respondent was released to parole on 6 August 2007. Senior counsel for the Crown acknowledged that that was, in itself an issue, or “a hurdle” that the Crown was required to overcome. 
     
      
    24 In relation to the contention by the Crown that there was a lack of accumulation in the sentences, reliance was placed upon the fact that there were different people involved in the premises in Polding Street and the residents at Throsby Street. 
     
      
    25 The Crown contention was, having regard to the maximum penalty in respect of the offence under s.196(b) of the Crimes Act (10 years), that the head sentence was too low and the accumulation was insufficient. 
     
      
    26 In relation to the question of accumulation, it is, as was submitted by Ms Kluss of counsel on behalf of the respondent, the fact that the sentencing judge did wholly accumulate the two groups of charges. 
     
      
    27 I am of the opinion that the approach adopted by the sentencing judge in structuring the sentences in the manner he did was one that was open to him as a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    28 In considering the individual sentences imposed, it is, as Ms Kluss on behalf of the respondent submitted, the case that his Honour identified each of the relevant matters in determining the objective seriousness of the offence, including, in particular, the amount of damage done, the cost of repairing the damage, the means used (explosive materials), the disregard for public safety, the element of planning and the motive of the respondent. Having done so, the experienced sentencing judge made an evaluation which I consider was one well within the range of the discretion available to him. I do not consider that any sentencing error has been identified. Nor do I consider that error should be inferred from the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    29 Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the appropriate order is that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    30 PRICE J: I agree with Hall J.

     Judgment 
      
      
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J. 2 HALL J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence by Timothy Hiron who was sentenced by Viney ADCJ on 8 December 2006 to a total effective sentence of imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of four years commencing on 22 July 2006 and expiring on 21 July 2010 with a balance of term of two years expiring on 21 July 2012. 
     
      
    4 The applicant had pleaded guilty on 16 October 2006 upon arraignment in the District Court to seven offences, namely: 
     
      
       
      Count 1a 
      : On the 25th August 2005 at Kings Langley in the State of New South Wales did assault Karin Anne Hiron thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm. 
       
       
      Count 2 
      : On the 1st October 2005 at Kings Langley in the State of New South Wales did assault Karin Anne Hiron thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm.  
       
       
      Count 3a 
      : On the 1st October 2005 at Kings Langely in the State of New South Wales did assault Karin Anne Hiron thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm. 
       
       
      Count 4a 
      : On the 2nd October 2005 at Kings Langley in the State of New South Wales did assault Karin Anne Hiron thereby occasioning to her actual bodily harm. 
       
       
      Count 5 
      : On the 2nd October 2005 at Kings Langley in the State of New South Wales did falsely imprison Karin Hiron. 
       
       
      Count 6 
      : On the 3rd October 2005 at Kings Langley in the State of New South Wales, did resist Timothy Clifford, a constable of police, while in the execution of his duty. 
       
       
      Count 7 
      : On the 3rd October 2005 at Kings Langley in the State of New South Wales, did resist Garry Adams, a constable of police, while in the execution of his duty. 
       
      
    5 The pleas of guilty were accepted by the Crown in full satisfaction of the indictment upon which the applicant had been arraigned. 
     
      
    6 Counts 1a to 4a are counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. Offences contrary to s 59(1) are punishable by five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    7 Count 5 is a common law misdemeanour with a penalty at large. 
     
      
    8 Counts 6 and 7 are counts of resisting a constable of police while in the execution of his duty contrary to s 58 of the Crimes Act. Offences contrary to s 58 are punishable by five years imprisonment. 
     
      
    9 The Judge imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      Count 1a 
      : a fixed term of nine months imprisonment to commence on 22 July 2006 and expire on 21 April 2007. 
       
       
      Count 2: 
       a fixed term of 9 months imprisonment to commence 22 April 2007 and expire 21 January 2008. 
       
       
      Counts 3a and 4a 
      : on each count to imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months, concurrent, to commence on 22 January 2008 and expire on 21 July 2010, with a parole period of two years to commence on 22 July 2010 and expire on 21 July 2012.  
       
       
      Counts 5, 6 and 7 
      : on each count to a fixed period of six months imprisonment to be concurrent with the non-parole periods on counts 3a and 4a to commence on 22 January 2008 and expiring on 21 July 2008. 
       
      
     The offences 
     
      
    10 An agreed statement of facts was placed before the Judge and may be conveniently summarised. 
     
      
    11 The victim of the offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and false imprisonment was Karin Hiron with whom the applicant had been in a de facto relationship for three years. At the time of the offences she was 23 weeks pregnant. Following the applicant’s release from prison in February 2005, Ms Hiron under questioning had informed him that during his imprisonment she had been involved in a number of relationships, including one with a serving prison officer. This had become a source of tension and dispute between them as did the subsequent pregnancy. 
     
      
       
      Count 1a 
       
      
    12 On 25 August 2005, Ms Hiron inadvertently sent an SMS text message to the applicant saying that she was leaving him. This resulted in the applicant demanding that she tell him about the details of a previous relationship, which she declined. The applicant then flicked her right eyeball with his finger and punched her to the left side of the head. Ms Hiron sustained redness to the white of her eye and significant pain to the head. Later that day, the applicant drove with Ms Hiron on the M2 Tollway at Seven Hills where he stopped the vehicle by the side of the road. He told the applicant to get out of the car which she did. Having taken a tyre lever from the car, the applicant took Ms Hiron down an embankment where he told her to get down on her hands and knees and said, “Right start talking cunt”. He nudged her on the back of the head with the tyre lever which resulted in Ms Hiron urinating on herself. The applicant told her to get up and they returned to the car. The applicant subsequently drove to Parramatta and parked on a vacant block. The applicant held Ms Hiron’s right wrist and twisted it to expose her elbow. He then said “start talking cunt” and held the tyre lever in one hand whilst holding Ms Hiron’s other arm behind her back. He held the tyre lever above Ms Hiron and repeated the demand to start talking. When a stranger walked nearby, the applicant stopped his threats and drove away. 
     
      
       
      Count 2  
       
      
    13 On 1 October 2005, at around 6pm, the applicant began questioning Ms Hiron about two of the men with whom she had had a relationship whilst he was in prison. He kicked Ms Hiron in the chest and punched her to the face, causing redness and soreness. He then grabbed her by the throat squeezing it for a few seconds, making it difficult for her to breath and said “You deserve to die, die, die”. This occurred in the bedroom of their home and ended when their six-year-old daughter entered the room. The applicant contacted his mother who came to the house a short time later and took the child to her home. 
     
      
       
      Count 3a 
       
      
    14 Over the next few hours Ms Hiron was questioned by the applicant about her relationship with the two men. During this time he hit her with a series of “boxing jabs” around the hairline. This caused redness and pain. The applicant continued to threaten her. 
     
      
       
      Count 4a 
       
      
    15 At about 5pm on the next day, the applicant recommenced questioning Ms Hiron about the two men. He told her to lie down on the lounge. The applicant then kicked her to the upper legs/buttock area and on a number of occasions punched her to the head. Ms Hiron was in extreme pain. 
     
      
       
      Count 5 
       
      
    16 The applicant had possession of Ms Hiron’s mobile phone and had connected the internet to the house phone preventing Ms Hiron from using either phone. She was forced to sit on the lounge room for a number of hours while the applicant questioned her. He subsequently took Ms Hiron in the car with him for some time before returning home. Upon returning home the applicant began checking the home computer to ascertain if she had been contacting other men. This continued for some hours. At about 11am the following morning (3 October) when the applicant fell asleep, Ms Hiron ran to a neighbour’s house and asked them to call police. Police officers arrived a short time later and observed that Ms Hiron had extensive bruising to both eyes and face. 
     
      
       
      Counts 6 and 7 
       
      
    17 The police officers entered the house and placed the applicant under arrest. They attempted to handcuff him but he resisted by throwing his arms and body around. The officers took approximately two to three minutes to subdue him.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    18 Evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of a pre-sentence report. The applicant was born on 7 March 1967 and at the time of offending was aged 38 years. He was adopted at the age of two weeks and is the youngest of three siblings. He had a normal upbringing and there were no alcohol or other issues in the family life. He was educated to year 8 leaving school at the age of 15.  
     
      
    19 He commenced cannabis use at the age of 12 graduating from the age of 15 to a serious heroin addiction and cocaine use. He has in the past participated in a methadone program and whilst in custody completed a drugs counselling course and accessed counselling. 
     
      
    20 The applicant’s relationship with Ms Hiron commenced approximately eight years before the present offences. They have two children. He told the author of the probation and parole report that he was very angry that his partner had relationships with other men whilst he was serving his last sentence and he did not want the assaults to happen but they did. He acknowledged that he should not have behaved in this way. The author of the report states that the applicant impresses as having the capacity to achieve at a much higher level than he has in the past and has demonstrated motivation at times to avoid conflict with the law. The need to address anger and relationship issues to appropriately resolve conflict situations is recognised, the author opines, by the applicant.  
     
      
    21 The applicant has a record of previous convictions which the Judge summarised in the following way (ROS p2): 
     
      
       
        
        “He is 36 years old and has a lengthy record for offences, mostly of dishonesty and traffic matters but including assault police and resisting arrest, and in 1994 assault in a domestic violence situation and in 2001 common assault. He has served a number of gaol sentences.” 
        
       
      
    22 At the time of the present offending, the applicant was on parole for the offence of robbery in circumstances of aggravation, that being the infliction of corporal violence under s 95 of the Crimes Act. He had been sentenced on 13 December 2002 to a term of six years imprisonment to date from 13 June 2001 and to expire on 12 June 2007. A non-parole period of three years and eight months was fixed to date from 13 June 2001 and to expire on 12 February 2005. The applicant had been released to parole but as a result of being charged with the present offences, his parole was revoked on 24 August 2006. His sentence for the balance of parole was to date from 3 October 2005 and expire on 21 July 2007. 
     
      
       
      Dealing with the Appeal  
       
      
    23 Ground 1 of the appeal is that his Honour erred in that he did not have proper regard to the maximum penalty for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The applicant’s complaint is confined to counts 3a and 4a for which he was sentenced on each count to a total term of imprisonment of four years and six months. As the Judge stated that he allowed a 20 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas, the length of the sentences imposed bespeak error. The maximum penalty for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm is five years imprisonment and the undiscounted starting point of each sentence if a twenty per cent discount was allowed must have been five years seven months (rounded down). The Judge in his sentencing remarks identified the statutory maximums for each of the offences and it may be that his Honour applied the utilitarian discount to the total sentence imposed for all seven counts. His Honour was, however, required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence before considering whether the total sentence properly reflected the totality of the criminality. The Crown concedes that whatever way the Judge approached the application of the discount the result in respect of these two counts is an error.  
     
      
    24 Ground 2 of the appeal is that his Honour erred in not having proper regard to the principle outlined in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. Ground 3 is that the overall sentence imposed as accumulated is manifestly excessive. As these grounds are related, it is convenient to deal with them together.  
     
      
    25 The applicant submits that the principle of totality was not sufficiently reflected in the aggregate sentence which given the objective circumstances and the subjective case for the applicant is manifestly excessive. The principle of totality applies, the applicant points out, not only where a judge is sentencing for two or more offences but also when he is serving the balance of a sentence when his parole has been revoked. 
     
      
    26 His Honour was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation, concurrence and totality. He was required to impose an overall aggregate sentence that fairly and justly reflects the totality of the criminality involved: see Pearce, R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252. The principle of totality also applies where a sentence is being served: see Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59, Regina v Hajjo (Court of Criminal Appeal, 31 August 1992, unreported). At the time of sentence the applicant was serving the balance of a sentence following the revocation of his parole. The Judge was required to apply the principle of totality to the seven offences for which the applicant was to be sentenced and to the existing sentence being served.  
     
      
    27 His Honour’s approach to the sentencing task indicates that he was mindful of the principle of totality. He expressly referred to the Crown prosecutor’s submission that there had to be some degree of accumulation of sentence in line with Pearce and went on to remark:  
     
      
       
        
        “and of course bearing in mind the principal (sic) of totality”.  
        
       
      (ROS at 7). 
       
      
    28 The Judge recognised that the applicant was serving the balance of parole and backdated the sentence for count 1a so that it commenced on 22 July 2006 although the sentence being served did not expire until 21 July 2007. He did so to avoid what he regarded as the consequence of double punishment as the applicant’s parole had been revoked because of the offences for which he was to be sentenced. This was a matter within his Honour’s discretion: Callaghan v The Queen (2006) 160 A Crim R 145 at [21] which was exercised favourably to the applicant. The Judge was not obliged to backdate the sentence to 3 October 2005. 
     
      
    29 His Honour made some sentences cumulative and others concurrent to arrive at the total sentence. Count 1a was made partially concurrent on the existing sentence, count 2 was cumulative on the preceding count, counts 3a and 4a were cumulative on count 2 but to be served concurrently with each other and counts 5, 6 and 7 were concurrent with counts 3a and 4a. The course adopted by the Judge was open to him and would have been consistent with the principles in Pearce if he had first fixed appropriate sentences for counts 3a and 4a. Indeed the concurrency of these sentences was generous to the applicant as counts 3a and 4a represented separate episodes of violence.  
     
      
    30 Applying to the total effective head sentence of six years a discount of 20 per cent for the plea, the notional starting point of the sentence is seven years and six months. The applicant submits that this starting point is beyond the appropriate range.  
     
      
    31 Judicial Commission sentencing statistics and cases imposing sentences for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm have been included in the written submissions. I have not found the material to be of much assistance as the present case involves repeated acts of violence in a domestic setting.  
     
      
    32 Offences for violent attacks in domestic settings, this Court has emphasised, must be treated with real seriousness. Important factors in sentencing a domestic violence offender are specific and general deterrence, denunciation of the offending conduct and protection of the community: see for example R v Edigarov (2001) 125 A Crim R 551, R v Dunn (2004) 144 A Crim R 180, R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302. As was said by Wood CJ at CL (Studdert and Bell JJ agreeing) in Edigarov at 558 [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished, and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.”  
        
       
      
    33 It is evident that the Judge was mindful of the relevant sentencing principles which were summarised by Johnson J (with whom Hunt AJA and Latham J agreed) in Hamid and recognised that the facts in Hamid involved more extensive episodes of violence and three separate victims. Hamid, however, was a successful Crown appeal and Johnson J when re-sentencing [at 149] acknowledged the restraint of the double jeopardy principle and imposed sentences “at the lower end of the available range”.  
     
      
    34 In the present case, each of the four offences of assault occasioning actual bodily harm involved separate episodes of violence towards Ms Hiron who was then pregnant. The seriousness of the offence of false imprisonment is not to be overlooked as the circumstances of Ms Hiron’s detention were plainly distressful. After each of the individual offences of assault, the appellant was afforded the opportunity to reflect upon his actions and to appreciate that the violent abuse of his partner was wrong.  
     
      
    35 The applicant’s offending was compendiously summarised by the Judge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… on the dates in question, the subject of the charges, he inflicted upon the victim brutal and savage assaults. Photographs of the victim following the final assault indicate to some extent the ferocity of his abuse. It is also clear to me that the prisoner is a man of large and strong physique. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown tendered a Victim impact Statement from the victim and a report from Mariela Occelli, clinical psychologist, which indicates that the victim has continued to suffer on going trauma as a result of these offences. It is clear that the injury and emotional harm caused to the victim is substantial. 
        
       
       
        
        The offences, or some of them, involved the actual use of a weapon, namely a tyre lever. The offences involved gratuitous cruelty, punching and kicking his domestic partner 23 weeks pregnant, and threatening her. The offences were committed while the prisoner was on conditional liberty, that is on parole. He abused a position of trust as a partner of the victim and father of their child and expected child. The victim was vulnerable in the sense that she was a pregnant female of much smaller build totally under the domination of the prisoner”  
        (ROS at 3). 
        
       
      
    36 At the time of the commission of the offences the applicant was on parole for the offence of robbery in circumstances of aggravation. The commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: see for example Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40-42].  
     
      
    37 The circumstances of aggravation of the offence of robbery involved serious acts of violence whereby the victim, a 23-year-old female, was physically assaulted and threatened with injury by the use of a knife, although a knife was not produced. As the Judge remarked in the passage I have quoted at paragraph 21 the prisoner has a lengthy criminal record. Having regard to the applicant’s criminal history, the Judge was entitled to give more weight to considerations of personal deterrence and protection of the community than otherwise would be the case: see R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242, R v M.A.K., R v M.S.K. [2006] NSWCCA 381. 
     
      
    38 It is evident that his Honour gave sympathetic consideration to the subjective case advanced on behalf of the applicant.  
     
      
    39 The repeated episodes of violence committed by the applicant whilst on parole required a deterrent sentence. I am not persuaded that the notional starting point of the aggregate sentence is manifestly excessive. The aggregate sentence to my mind fairly and justly reflects the totality of the criminality of his conduct.  
     
      
    40 The second and third grounds of appeal fail. 
     
      
    41 Although error has been identified, I am not of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. No lesser sentence is warranted and this Court should not intervene other than to impose appropriate sentences for counts 3a and 4a. 42 Whilst it is necessary to re-sentence for counts 3a and 4a the orders that I propose will not impact upon the overall sentence imposed by the Judge as these counts will be partially accumulated.  
     
      
    43 I propose the following orders:  
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (ii) Quash the sentence imposed by Viney ADCJ for count 3a being an offence contrary to s 59(1)  
      Crimes Act 
       1900.  
       
       
      (iii) Sentence the applicant on count 3a to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months commencing on 22 January 2008 and expiring on 21 October 2009 and a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 22 October 2009 and expiring on 21 October 2011.  
       
       
      (iv) Quash the sentence imposed by Viney ADCJ for count 4a being an offence contrary to s 59(1)  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. 
       
       
      (v) Sentence the applicant on count 4a to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months commencing on 22 October 2008 and expiring on 21 July 2010 and a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 22 July 2010 and expiring on 21 July 2012. 
       
       
        
        The total effective sentence of imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of four years commencing on 22 July 2006 and expiring on 21 July 2010 with a balance of term of two years expiring on 21 July 2012 remains unaltered.  
        
       
       
        
        The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole remains 21 July 2010.

     Judgment 
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J 
     
      
    2 HALL J: The Crown, by way of notice of appeal, dated 28 June 2007 gave notice pursuant to s.5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) whereby the Acting Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions indicated his desire to appeal to this Court against a sentence pronounced in the District Court of New South Wales at Sydney on 28 July 2006 (Taylor, DCJ). 
     
      
    3 The respondent was charged with an offence under s.86(2)(a) of the Crimes Act (the aggravated form of the offence of kidnapping). He originally faced trial with two co-offenders, Eric Moefili and Joseph Montinez. The co-offenders were found guilty following a second trial. The respondent was called to give evidence in the first trial by the Crown. The jury were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. On the re-trial, the Crown did not call the respondent to give evidence. This was said to be by reason of a decision by the Crown Prosecutor based upon the respondent’s departure from a statement he gave police dated 30 March 2006 in two particular respects (referred to below) and by reason of a belligerent attitude it was claimed he displayed towards those acting for the Crown at the second trial. 
     
      
    4 In order to understand the ways in which the Crown contended the respondent gave evidence at the first trial which was at variance with his statement, it is necessary, briefly, to refer to the factual matters relevant to the kidnapping offence. 
     
      
    5 The kidnap victim was Sempat Abkarian, also known as “Sam”. The respondent had a son who died on 7 February 2002 aged 19 years from a fatal drug overdose. The respondent claimed that his son’s death had not been properly investigated and he wanted “some answers” from Abkarian who he understood was with his son at the time he died. He said he wanted to know how his son had died. 
     
      
    6 A plan was made by the respondent with Moefili and Montinez whereby Moefili undertook to find the victim for a payment of $10,000. There was much evidence as to the events leading up to the eventual unlawful detention of the victim Abkarian in November 2004. He was ultimately taken to a street in the Blacktown region. On alighting from a car, the victim, according to the respondent, commenced to run away, but was caught by Moefili who brought him back and made him kneel in front of the respondent. At the trial, the respondent departed from the account in his statement to the extent that he said the victim “pretended” to run away. This potentially carried significance for, if accepted, it suggested that Abkarian had not, in truth, been captured and restrained by the respondent’s co-offenders. 
     
      
    7 Mr Purves, in his affidavit sworn 20 August 2007, said (paragraph 5):- 
     
      
       
        
        “During the course of his examination in chief, he referred to the victim, Mr Abkarian, ‘pretending’ to run away from the accused Moefili. This was not in accordance with his police statement of 30 March 2006 …” 
        
       
      
    8 In relation to the second matter concerning the evidence given by the respondent at the first trial of his co-offenders, Mr Purves stated in his last-mentioned affidavit (paragraph 5):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… In cross-examination, he said that he recognised one of the voices in the background of one of the telephone intercepts as Abkarian’s voice … and that he was suspicious that if he paid money to the accused, the victim might receive some of the money. Again, this was not in accordance with his police statement.” 
        
       
      
    9 This last-mentioned matter was said to have raised the issue of “a set-up”, that is, that the victim was, in fact, party to a scheme with Moefili and Montinez. The Crown Prosecutor obtained leave to cross-examine the respondent under s.38 of the Evidence Act. It was put to him that he was mistaken on the voice identification of the victim. The respondent denied that he was mistaken. 
     
      
    10 Eric Moefili and Joseph Montinez were charged that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) on or around 11 November 2004 at Sydney, while in the company of each other, they detained Sempat Abkarian without his consent, with intent to obtain an advantage; and 
       
       
      (b) between 11 November 2004 and 19 November 2004 at Sydney, in the company of each other, with menaces, demanded from Sempat Abkarian money, with intent to steal that property from Sempat Abkarian. 
       
      
    11 The jury were, as earlier noted, unable to reach a unanimous verdict. 
     
      
    12 The second trial was heard in January and February 2007. The jury returned a guilty verdict on 2 February 2007. 
     
      
    13 Mr Purves stated in his first affidavit that he appeared at the second trial of the matter held in January and February 2007. Before the trial on Monday 22 January 2007, he and his instructing solicitor, Ms Jassy, conferred with the respondent. He said the respondent became quite belligerent during the conference and his attitude was abrasive. The respondent claimed that “it was a set up”, by which he explained that he meant a “set up by Abkarian and Moefili”. Mr Purves reminded him of his plea of guilty and asked him to read his statement. The respondent then said words to the effect that the police had pressured him to plead guilty and that he had been given bad legal advice and he should not have pleaded guilty. However, Mr Purves stated he did not say that he wished to withdraw his plea. 
     
      
    14 Mr Purves’ assessment was that he expected the respondent to be a difficult witness and, ultimately, decided that he would not call him as a prosecution witness but simply make him available for cross-examination. However, following discussion, counsel for each co-accused said that they did not want to cross-examine him. Accordingly, the respondent was not called to give evidence. 
     
      
    15 The respondent further stated in his affidavit (paragraph 25) that he gave evidence on 28 September 2006 to the best of his ability and to the best of his memory on the day. He then explained in paragraph 26:- 
     
      
       
        
        “When I gave evidence about Moefili and Abkarian setting the kidnapping up, I had formed this view based on the transcript of conversation 637 between Abkarian and Moefili, which I have referred to above. After reading this conversation, I had reflected about the night of 11 November 2004 to see if there were any signs that it was a set up, and when I gave my evidence I was convinced in my own mind, because of what I read in that conversation, that it was a set up. I told my barrister, Mr Johnson, about my suspicion and he told Judge Taylor about this on my sentence.” 
        
       
      
    16 In relation to the question of Abkarian running from the car, he said in his affidavit (paragraph 28) that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… when I said that he was ‘pretending to run’, I had in my mind the above conversation between Abkarian and Moefili about getting me for $50,000 instead of $10,000. I had assumed that he must have been pretending to run, based on what he said to Moefili in that conversation. I don’t remember anyone asking me in Court why I thought he was pretending to run.” 
        
       
      
    17 The respondent denied that he was rude or aggressive with Mr Purves. He did recall being “a little bit upset”. He said there was no reference to anything about him having pleaded guilty and he did not recall being asked to read his statement. He denied that he had said that the police had pressured him to plead guilty. He claimed that Mr Purves told him what to say when he gave evidence. He said that he never asked him any questions about the evidence that he had given on 28 September 2006. He said that after his conversation with Mr Purves, he waited outside the court for a short time. A short time later he was told by Mr Purves that there was no need for him to give evidence. 
     
      
    18 Finally, the respondent said that he never had the assistance of a Greek interpreter during any conversation he had with Senior Constable Walsh, Ms Campbell (prosecuting counsel) or Mr Purves or anyone else concerning the matter (paragraph 37). He maintained that he was always willing to give evidence against his co-accused, that he had come to court to give evidence each time that he was asked and that he had fully co-operated with police and prosecutors at all times. 
     
      
    19 In relation to the conference held with the respondent in January 2007, Mr Purves stated that he did not discuss his evidence with the respondent and he did not tell him “what to say” when he gave evidence. He stated that he advised him as to the manner in which he should give his evidence. The conference, he said, was conducted in English and there was no difficulty in communication with the respondent. 
     
      
    20 I was not impressed with the respondent in the evidence that he gave in this appeal. He displayed an aggressive and dismissive attitude. Where his evidence conflicts with that of Mr Purves, I accept the evidence given by Mr Purves. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing proceedings 
       
      
    21 On 27 March 2006, the respondent pleaded not guilty to the following charge:- 
     
      
       
        
        On or about 11 November [2004] at Sydney, while in the company of Eric Moefili and Joseph Montinez, he detained Sempat Abkarian without his consent and with intent to hold him with intent to obtain an advantage contrary to the provisions of s.86(2)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        . 
        
       
      
    22 The maximum penalty for an offence under the provision is imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    23 On 20 March 2006, at trial, the respondent was originally re-arraigned and, upon such re-arraignment, he pleaded guilty to the offence. His Honour, as trial judge, accepted the plea of guilty, discharged the jury and adjourned the proceedings for sentence. 
     
      
    24 At the hearing on sentence, a document entitled Agreed Crown Facts dated 9 June 2006 was tendered and admitted as Exhibit A. The evidence also included a statement of Maria Stavropoulos (Exhibit B) and a pre-sentence report dated 9 June 2006. 
     
      
    25 The respondent was sentenced to a non-parole period of 10 months commencing on 28 July 2006 and expiring on 27 May 2007, with a further term of imprisonment for one year and two months commencing on 28 May 2007 and expiring on 27 July 2008 and directed, pursuant to the provisions of s.12 of that Act, that the sentence be suspended and the respondent be released from custody on condition that he enter into a good behaviour bond for the term of two years. 
     
      
    26 The ground relied upon in the notice of appeal is stated to be:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… that Cristos  
        STAVROPOULOS 
         received a reduced sentence because of his undertaking to assist law enforcement authorities and he failed to fulfil that undertaking.” 
        
       
      
    27 In the course of his remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge observed at pp.11-12:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The issue of motivation or purpose is so important on sentence that I set out in detail the offender’s statement which was prepared in conjunction with the police at Chatswood Police Station on 30 March 2006, that is a few days after he entered the plea of guilty.  
        It is important to recall that this is evidence that he is prepared to give in Court 
        . The statement is consistent with the way events unfolded on the evening of the offence, particularly the conduct of the offender in the car in what seems to have been the focus of the detention, that is, the interrogation of the victim at a remote place. The subsequent conduct of the offender, leaving the area when this had been done, is also consistent with what his purpose was in being involved in the offence. I am not persuaded that the evidence suggests that the offender had an expectation that some injury was to befall the victim once he left.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      The Crown’s contentions 
       
      
    28 The Crown, on this appeal, asserted that the respondent did not give evidence in accordance with his statement and he thereby failed to fulfil the undertaking which the Crown alleged he had given. The first trial, as noted earlier, culminated with a failure by the jury to agree upon a verdict and on 6 October 2006, the jury was discharged. 
     
      
    29 The Crown in this appeal relied upon the following facts:- 
     
      
       
        
        “On 22 January 2007, during a conference, the respondent showed Mr Billy Purves of counsel, the Crown Prosecutor briefed to appear for the Crown in the trial in Moefili and Montinez, that he did not intend to fulfil his undertaking to assist the law enforcement authorities. On that date at Sydney District Court, before his Honour Judge Geraghty and a jury, each of Moefili and Montinez pleaded not guilty to each of the charges set forth in paragraph 6 of the submissions. The respondent, having shown that he did not intend to give evidence then in accordance with his undertaking, the Crown Prosecutor did not call him to give evidence at the trial. On 2 February 2007, the jury found each of Moefili and Montinez guilty of both offences and on 4 April 2007, his Honour Judge Geraghty sentenced each of them to terms of imprisonment.”  
        (Appellant’s written submissions, paragraph 7) 
        
       
      
    30 The Crown, in its written submissions, contended:- 
     
      
       
        
        “18. The respondent, having failed to fulfil his undertaking to give evidence against Moefili and Montinez, this Court has power to vary the sentences imposed upon the respondent by his Honour: Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s.5DA(2) and  
        Regina v Bagnall 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 10 June 1994). The reason why the respondent failed to fulfil his undertaking is of little materiality:  
        Regina v El-Sayed 
         (2003) 57 NSWLR 659, paragraph 32, per Simpson J. 
        
       
       
        
        19. No case appearing for the exercise of this Court’s discretion to dismiss this appeal, this Court should increase the sentences imposed by his Honour by the amount by which it was reduced by reason of the respondent’s undertaking, so as to impose a sentence that would have been imposed (had) the respondent not undertaken to give evidence against Moefili and Montinez:  
        Regina v Waqa  
        (2004) 149 A Crim R 143, paragraphs 24-26 per Dunford J.” 
        
       
       
      Affidavit evidence 
       
      
    31 The Crown relied upon the following affidavits:- 
     
      
       
      • Affidavit of Mr Billy Purves sworn on 20 August 2007. 
       
       
      • Affidavit of Mr Billy Purves sworn on 7 November 2007 (affidavit in reply to the respondent’s affidavit sworn on 30 October 2007). 
       
       
      • Affidavit of Pearl Jassy, solicitor, sworn on 20 August 2007. 
       
       
      • Affidavit of Detective Senior Constable Benjamin Paul Walsh sworn on 8 November 2007. 
       
      
    32 The respondent relied upon the following affidavits:- 
     
      
       
      • His own affidavit sworn on 30 October 2007. 
       
       
      • Affidavit of Maria Stavropoulos sworn on 30 October 2007. 
       
       
      • Affidavit of Thi Ngoc Gan Gerg Le sworn on 30 October 2007. 
       
      
    33 Mr Purves was cross-examined on his affidavit by Mr A J Bellanto QC, who appeared with Ms Jehane Ghabrial on behalf of the respondent. The respondent was cross-examined by the Crown on his abovementioned affidavit. 
     
      
       
      Issues arising in the appeal 
       
      
    34 The written submissions for the respondent dated 12 November 2007 identify the following as the issues arising on the application brought by the Acting Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions:- 
     
      
       
        
        Issue 1:  
        Whether the respondent, in fact,  
        gave an undertaking 
         to give evidence. 
         
         
        Issue 2:  
        Whether the sentencing judge in determining the respondent’s sentence,  
        gave him a discount 
         by reason of any undertaking to give evidence. 
         
         
        Issue 3: 
         If the sentencing judge did make such a discount, then what were the terms of the undertaking and were those terms breached by the respondent? 
         
         
        Issue 4:  
        If an undertaking was given by the respondent which he breached, whether the Court had a discretion not to intervene and, if so, how that discretion should be exercised. 
        
       
       
      The issue as to whether an undertaking was given by the respondent 
       
       
      (a) Assistance to authorities 
       
      
    35 At the sentencing hearing on 9 June 2006, the sentencing judge was advised by counsel for the respondent that, in circumstances which would be clarified by the Crown, there was no letter of assistance from police authorities. I note that no such clarification was given to the sentencing judge. The Crown did not suggest that the respondent had given an undertaking by way of future assistance in writing, nor was there any evidence of a memorandum or record of an obligation on the respondent to give evidence at the hearing of charges brought against his co-offenders. 
     
      
    36 The sentencing judge stated (remarks on sentence, p.26):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In considering assistance to authorities, I am required to consider the matters set out in s.23(ss2) of the Act. I have set out the statement of the offender and of the police in detail. In my view, it was of significant assistance to authorities. I do not think this offender is likely to commit any other offences after release. He would, most likely, suffer harsher conditions as a consequence of this assistance. The evidence of the offender is direct evidence and accepting, as I do, his purpose in committing the offence is reliable evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Regina v Sukkar 
         [2006] NSWCCA 92, Howie J discussed the appropriate discount that should be given to an offender for plea and assistance. His Honour expressed the opinion that such discounts of more than 40% should be very exceptional. It is likely that the offender will be called as a Crown witness. In conformity with  
        Sukkar’s 
         case, it was held in  
        Regina v Maka (No 2) 
         [2005] NSWCCA that a ‘rolled up’ discount for plea and assistance is appropriate. In my opinion, a discount for the plea and assistance of one-third from what would otherwise be appropriate as a head sentence is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    37 In the conclusion to the section of the remarks on sentence entitled “motivation”, the sentencing judge recorded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst this conduct, for the purposes submitted by the Crown is suspicious, I have concluded that what Mr Stavropoulos said to the police on 30 March and about which he is prepared to give evidence, represents what is and went through his mind at all material times.” 
        
       
      
    38 I note here that the sentencing judge spoke in terms of a willingness or preparedness by the respondent to give evidence, rather than there being any reference to an undertaking or an obligation by him to do so. 
     
      
    39 Section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 23(1) is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A Court may impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose on an offender, having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted, or undertaken to assist, law enforcement authorities in the prevention, detection or investigation of, or in proceedings relating to, the offence concerned or any other offence.” 
        
       
      
    40 Section 23(2) identifies specific matters which the Court must consider in deciding whether to impose a lesser penalty for an offence and the nature and extent of the penalty. These include the matters set out in s.23(2)(a) to (j). The relevant sub-paragraphs, for the purposes of the present appeal, are those in (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (i). They are in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(b) The significance and usefulness of the offender’s assistance to the authority or authorities concerned, taking into consideration any evaluation by the authority or authorities of the assistance rendered or undertaken to be rendered, 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the truthfulness, completeness and reliability of any information or evidence provided by the offender, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the nature and extent of the offender’s assistance or promised assistance, 
        
       
       
        
        (e) the timeliness of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 
        
       
       
        
        (f) any benefits that the offender has gained or may gain by reason of the assistance or undertaking to assist, 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (i) whether the assistance or promised assistance concerns the offence for which the offender is being sentenced or an unrelated offence.” 
        
       
      
    41 It is clear that the provisions of s.23(1) and (2) distinguish between assistance that an offender has provided and an undertaking to provide assistance (both assistance in the prevention, detection or investigation of the offence concerned or any other offence and, as well, assistance or an undertaking to assist “in proceedings relation to …” the offence or any other offence). 
     
      
    42 It was common ground that the statement provided by the respondent dated 30 March 2006 to police constitutes “assistance” within the meaning of s.23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The issue is whether or not the respondent also undertook to further assist the Crown by having given an undertaking to assist in proceedings against his co-offenders. 
     
      
       
      (b) Submissions at the sentencing hearing on the question of assistance 
       
      
    43 Counsel for the respondent in his submissions on sentence adverted to the fact that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… normally that [referring to the issue of assistance] would be in the form of a letter to the Court and perhaps I’ll let my friend explain where there isn’t or just discuss that if there’s anything she wishes to say … against what I’m submitting.” 
        
       
      
    44 An observation was made during submissions that it may have been difficult for the sentencing judge to assess the assistance without a letter as to its value. Following counsel’s reference to the fact that the respondent had given a statement to police, his Honour observed “I’ve got the statement that he’s prepared to give”. 
     
      
    45 The submissions for the respondent continued that it was “proposed”, so far as counsel for the respondent was aware, that his client and his wife would be called as witnesses for the Crown. He, however, acknowledged that there was an issue in the statement (related to the matter as to whether a threat against the life of a victim was made by the respondent), which indicated that the respondent’s statement was at variance with the victim’s statement in that respect. Reference was made to this as indicating that the Crown may consider a potential difficulty in calling the respondent in the Crown case. 
     
      
    46 In reply, the Crown, in its submissions, stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Finally in relation to the assistance, your Honour, the Crown has the statements from Mr Stavropoulos and his wife. Obviously, it’s (sic) end up being a matter for the trial Crown as to whether this witness will be called. I imagine that the offender will be and as my friend conceded that the only issue that may come up is that the Crown obviously is (sic) concerning that it may not have been as full and frank as what we had wished for.” 
        
       
       
      Analysis 
       
      
    47 Section 5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 provides, so far as is relevant:- 
     
      
       
        
        “s.5DA Appeal by Crown against reduced sentence for assistance to authorities 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence imposed on a person that was reduced because the person undertook to assist law enforcement authorities if the person fails wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) On an appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal may, if it is satisfied that the person has failed wholly or partly to fulfil the undertaking, vary the sentence and impose such sentence as it thinks fit.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    48 The principles to be applied on an appeal under s.5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act have been stated in a number of cases, including Regina v O’Brien (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 June 1993), Regina v El-Sayed [2003] 57 NSWLR 659, Regina v Waqa (2004) 149 A Crim R 143, Regina v KS [2005] NSWCCA 87, Regina v Chaaban [2006] NSWCCA 352 and Regina v Douar [2007] NSWCCA 123. 
     
      
    49 In the latter case, James J, with whom Rothman and Harrison JJ agreed, extracted the following statements of principle from the relevant case law:- 
     
      
       
      •  
      “The purpose of s.5DA is not punitive. The purpose is to enable this Court in an appropriate case, and to an appropriate extent, to intervene to adjust or correct a sentence where the sentencing process can be seen, with the benefit of hindsight, to have miscarried by reason of the circumstances set out in the section” 
       ( 
      O’Brien 
       (supra) per Gleeson CJ at [12]). 
       
       
      •  
      “If the assistance and, in particular, the evidence, is not forthcoming, the discount has been obtained on an expectation which has not been fulfilled and the basis for the reduced sentence is removed. It is in these circumstances that s.5DA allows a sentence to be varied to that which would have been imposed, subject always to the Court’s discretion not to intervene where circumstances justify such a course …” 
       ( 
      Waqa 
       (supra) at 147, [24], per Dunford J). 
       
       
      •  
      “… s.5DA only authorises this Court to review the sentence where there has been a breach of an undertaking to provide the future assistance. In other words, where a discount has been allowed for the provision of past assistance and an undertaking to provide future assistance, and there is subsequently a breach of the undertaking to provide future assistance, this Court can adjust the sentence on account of the breach of that undertaking, but cannot interfere with that part of the reduction that has been allowed on account of the past assistance” 
       ( 
      Waqa 
       (supra) at 147-148, [26], per Dunford J). 
       
       
      •  
      “In the event that the contemplated assistance is not given, s.5DA provides a mechanism that allows the discount to be excised. It does not admit of reviewing the sentence generally …” 
       ( 
      Chaaban 
       (supra) at [52], per Bell J). 
       
       
      •  
      “The ability of the Crown to invoke the section is a very important part of the criminal justice system. Persons who give undertakings and who receive the benefit of those undertakings by way of a discounted sentence can, subject to exceptional circumstances, expect to have their sentences increased if they renege on their undertaking to give evidence. The departure from an undertaking of that kind is not to be regarded lightly and it will normally justify appellate intervention” 
       ( 
      KS 
       (supra) at [19], per Wood CJ at CL). 
       
      
    50 The above dicta emphasise, as relevant to the present appeal, that it is necessary on an application under s.5DA for the Crown to establish:- 
     
      
       
      (a) that a relevant undertaking was given by the offender; 
       
       
      (b) a breach of such undertaking occurred by the offender’s failure to provide the contemplated assistance. 
       
       
      (c) That in consequence, the sentencing process miscarried. 
       
      
    51 The expression “undertaking” is not defined in the Act. Its ordinary English meaning is to “take on (an obligation, duty, task etc); commit oneself to perform … give a formal promise or pledge …” (Shorter Oxford English Dictionary). 
     
      
    52 The sentencing judge referred to the requirement for him to consider the matters set out in s.23(2) following which he stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I have set out the statement of the offender and of the police in detail. In my view, it was of significant assistance to authorities …”  
        (remarks on sentence, p.26) 
        
       
      
    53 His Honour then went on to deal with other issues germane to the sentencing task. 
     
      
    54 The sentencing judge, in due course, turned to the question of, what he termed “the appropriate discount” that should be given to the respondent “for plea in [sic – should read “and”] assistance” (remarks on sentence, p.26). His Honour then referred to the judgment of Howie J in Regina v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92. In that context, his Honour stated (at p.26):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… It is likely that the offender will be called as a Crown witness. In conformity with  
        Sukkar’s 
          
        case, it was held in  
        Regina v Maka (No 2) 
          
        [2005] NSWCCA that a ‘rolled up’ discount for plea and assistance is appropriate. In my opinion, a discount for the plea and assistance of one-third from what would otherwise be appropriate as a head sentence is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    55 It is to be observed in relation to the above remarks on sentence that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) The sentencing judge expressly considered that the statement provided by police dated 30 March 2006 constituted  
      “assistance” 
       within the meaning of s.23 of the abovementioned Act. 
       
       
      (b) The statement was evaluated as being  
      “of significant assistance to authorities” 
      . 
       
       
      (c) So far as future assistance was concerned, the sentencing judge’s references were confined to statements as to the respondent’s preparedness to give evidence and the likelihood that he would be called as a Crown witness. There is, however, no reference in the remarks on sentence to an undertaking or to an obligation arising under an undertaking of the kind referred to in s.23 of the Act. 
       
       
      (d) By the time the sentencing hearing took place, the co-offenders had already been charged. 
       
      
    56 It is plainly desirable that any undertaking or promise for future assistance referred to in s.23 of the Act is framed with a degree of specificity. This is so, firstly, so that the nature and extent of any obligation arising under an undertaking may be identified and, secondly, to provide a proper basis for proceedings under s.5DA of the Criminal Appeal Act in which a question of breach of undertaking arises.  
     
      
    57 An undertaking to give evidence is commonly framed in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I, (NAME OF OFFENDER) hereby undertake to give evidence at any proceedings (including any appeal and re-trial) against (NAMED OFFENDERS) and for the offence of (SPECIFIED OFFENCE OR OFFENCES). 
        
       
       
        
        AND I further undertake to give active co-operation, including the giving of evidence truthfully and frankly in accordance with the statement made by me on (SPECIFIED DATE), a copy of which is attached. 
        
       
       
        
        AND everything that I have said in this statement is true and I have not withheld any information. 
        
       
       
        
        I give this undertaking with the knowledge, consent and advice of my legal representative.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (Witness)” 
        
       
      
    58 In the present case, as I have indicated, there was no record made of an undertaking or a promise of assistance setting out the terms or conditions said to apply to the same. 
     
      
    59 In relation to the statement of 30 March 2006, it has been correctly submitted on behalf of the respondent that there was no evidence that it was an induced statement and that the basis upon which it was given is stated in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. This statement made by me accurately sets out the evidence which I would be prepared, if necessary, to give in court as a witness. The statement is true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing that, if it is tendered in evidence, I will be liable to prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything that I know to be false or do not believe to be true.” 
        
       
      
    60 Accordingly, the position in the present matter is that:- 
     
      
       
      (a) There is no indication in the respondent’s statement of 30 March 2006 of an undertaking by him that he would give evidence or that, if he were called to give evidence, it would be in the terms of his written statement. 
       
       
      (b) There is no evidence given by any witness on behalf of the Crown that the respondent, in fact, gave an undertaking as now claimed. 
       
       
      (c) There is no indication in the remarks on sentence either that an undertaking had been given within the meaning of s.23 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       or that in determining the sentence, the sentencing judge determined the respondent’s sentence upon the basis that some undertaking had been given by him within the terms of s.23. 
       
       
      (d) There was some uncertainty as to whether or not the Crown would call the respondent to give evidence at the hearing of proceedings against his co-offenders. However, the prospect that he would be called was spoken of in terms of it being  
      “likely” 
      . 
       
       
      (e) The evidence at its highest establishes that the respondent was prepared to give evidence, that there was an expectation of him being called to give evidence and of his stated willingness or preparedness to give evidence. 
       
      
    61 In oral submissions, the Crown contended that the Court could infer that an undertaking had been given as the discount given on sentence was, it submitted, something which “bespeaks” the giving of an undertaking. There are two points in relation to that submission. Firstly, a reading of the transcript of the sentencing hearing conveys that there was an expectation that the respondent would more than likely be called to give evidence at his co-offender’s trial. An expectation, however, is not an undertaking within the meaning of s.23 of the Act. Secondly, whilst it is clear that the respondent had provided a measure of assistance in the form of his statement to police and prospectively indicated his preparedness to give evidence, the issue as to whether he was obligated to give evidence was not raised before the sentencing judge. If, in consequence, future assistance was overvalued, that has not, in this appeal, been pursued by way of a contention suggesting sentencing error. Accordingly, there is no requirement for this Court to deal with that question on this appeal. 
     
      
    62 In my opinion, the appeal must fail upon the basis that the evidence does not establish that the respondent bound himself, by way of a promise or undertaking, an essential matter for an application under s.5DA. 
     
      
    63 By reason of the conclusion that I have reached on the first issue identified in paragraph [34], it is unnecessary to consider the further issues including in particular, the contention as to breach of undertaking. 
     
      
    64 I, accordingly, am of the opinion that no basis has been established by the Crown which would warrant this Court re-sentencing the respondent. 
     
      
    65 Accordingly, I would propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    66 PRICE J: I agree with Hall J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      1. This is an appeal by JJH. JJH was born on 30 July 1990, so that he turned seventeen this year. He is appealing against two sentences imposed upon him by the Children’s Court. The sentences were imposed for two offences of armed robbery with an offensive weapon. These are offences against s 97 of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . In each case the magistrate imposed a control order under s 33(1)(g) of the  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
       of twenty-one months comprising a minimum term, so to speak, of fifteen months and an additional term, so to speak, of six months. Both sentences dated from 31 October 2007 and therefore ran together. 
       
       
      2. Briefly, the facts of the offences were these. On 30 July with another person JJH held up a service station at Normanhurst. He was armed with a knife. He stole money and a mobile phone from the attendant. Cigarettes were also stolen. The next day JJH was involved in a very similar robbery. Once again it was a service station but this time at North St Marys. Once again it involved a knife but this time JJH threatened the attendant, demanding that he open the drawer or be cut and in addition he jumped on to the counter and then leapt down to where the attendant was meant to be protected. His co-offender kicked the access door down. Once again money and cigarettes were stolen. 
       
       
      3. Needless to say a description of these two offences demonstrates how serious they were. They must have been terrifying experiences for each of the attendants involved. Attendants at service stations like those perform an important service for members of the public. In each case the robbery occurred at night-time. The fact that people work in those jobs enables members of the public to go about their business and refuel their cars and buy provisions as and when they are needed. But the job exposes them to crimes such as this. It is important for a court such as mine to bear in mind the need for people in those sorts of jobs to be protected. 
       
       
      4. JJH, for a seventeen year old, has a long criminal record. It commenced with an armed robbery with an offensive weapon on 16 December 2003 when JJH was thirteen years old. It includes, amongst numerous other entries, crimes of aggravated break and enter in company, having a knife in a public place and four counts of armed robbery with an offensive weapon.  
       
        
       
      5. When JJH’s personal background is taken into account, the Court has some insight into what has driven him to this behaviour. He was born to a mother who was a drug addict. She was thirteen when she had JJH. His own mother has been in prison for significant periods of time. 
       
       
      6. The report from the Department of Juvenile Justice dated 10 September 2007 details some of JJH’s personal history. He has had trouble at school and although keen on sports, has had difficulty committing himself. He has no visible means of support. He has a history of breaching community based orders. There has been in the past some history of conflict between him and his mother and his grandmother. The report recommends that any period of parole be subject to certain conditions, which I will return to. 
       
       
      7. JJH gave evidence before me at Parramatta on 22 November 2007. He told me how he had a history of alcohol and drug dependency and was a user of a wide range of illegal drugs. His armed robberies were committed to support his drug and alcohol habits. They were often committed on the spur of the moment and the two offences which are the subject of this appeal were like that. He commenced his drug use at the age of about eleven or twelve. Drug usage was part of his household where he lived. Both his parents are in custody. He saw them both taking drugs. He had even been involved with armed robberies with his own mother when he was ten years old. 
       
       
      8. In custody he has completed Year 10. He has undertaken a bricklaying course and has engaged in sport. More importantly, he has been doing a drug and alcohol course and has been seeing a psychologist. Understandably, he does not like being locked up and wants to address his own drug dependency. He is keen to enter a live-in rehabilitation centre. For the future, he is keen to get himself employment and become more involved in sport, including rugby league. He would like to, on release, live with his sisters and his mother’s mother, his own grandmother. 
       
       
      9. Ms Clifford, who appears for JJH, submits that the appeal should be allowed. The order which she is seeking is an adjustment of the non-parole period to the parole period. Her submission is that there has been significant progress considering JJH’s background. This progress has occurred whilst he has been in custody. An earlier release from custody would enable him to carry on with his rehabilitation but in the context of the community. 
       
       
      10. The respondent to the appeal, the DPP, submits through his representatives, Ms Fitzpatrick and Ms Tabone, that there is a basis for adjusting the ratio and there are special circumstances to form that basis but that I need to keep in mind the seriousness of the crime and the fact that it was committed whilst he was on parole. That is a fact which I have not yet mentioned and which aggravates these offences. The fact that any person committing a crime does so whilst they are at liberty from the courts because of bail or parole is an aggravating factor because they have abused the liberty which the justice system has allowed them. 
       
       
      11. In determining whether or not to allow this appeal I have to weigh the seriousness of these two crimes along with the fact that JJH has a bad criminal record and the fact that these were committed on parole against his need as a young person for rehabilitation. The legislation dealing with young people emphasises that priority is to be given to opportunities for a young person to pursue their education and rehabilitation. 
       
       
      12. I have decided to allow the appeal and I propose shortly to formally order that there be an adjustment in the ratio so that the minimum term is twelve months and the additional term is nine months. I regard any minimum term less than twelve months as inappropriately low because of the seriousness of these two offences and because of the fact they were committed whilst JJH was on parole. I also have regard to the need for the Court by its sentence to discourage him from committing these sorts of crimes again. On the other hand, I am impressed by his efforts to rehabilitate himself in custody. A young man with his past and background must be given, in my opinion, every opportunity to pursue his own rehabilitation. 
       
       
      13. Accordingly, the formal orders which I make are these. In accordance with s20(2)(a) of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 
       I determine this appeal against sentence by setting aside the sentence of the learned magistrate. Instead of that sentence and under s 33(1)(g) of the  
      Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 
       for each of the two offences I make an order committing JJH for twenty-one months to the control of the Minister administering the  
      Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987 
      . I specify that that term is to commence on 31 October 2007 and to conclude on 30 July 2009. I specify a non-parole period of one year from 31 October 2007 to 30 October 2008. The balance of the term will be nine months from 31 October 2008 to 30 July 2009. 
       
       
      CLIFFORD: Excuse me, your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      CLIFFORD: Sorry. My friend and I were just - there’s some concern with the date. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      CLIFFORD: As the total sentence has remained the same - sorry, correct me, I may be wrong - but we thought that the end of the total sentence would be 
       
      30 January 2009 as previously stated. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: That makes sense, doesn’t it? 
       
       
      CLIFFORD: Sorry, your Honour, you are correct, sorry. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. I’m right, aren’t I? 
       
       
      TABONE: Yes, you are, your Honour. 
       
       
      CLIFFORD: Yes. 
       
       
      14. The balance of the term will be nine months from 31 October 2008 to 30 July 2009. Under s 50 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
       I make an order directing the release of JJH on parole on 30 October 2008. I impose the following conditions pursuant to s 51 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       on the parole order: that JJH (1) be of good behaviour, (2) accept the supervision of the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice, (3) attend any educational, employment and training programmes as directed by that Department, (4) participate in any programme provided by that Department, (5) attend any appointments arranged by that Department, (6) reside as directed by that Department, and (7) participate in any mentor support programme arranged by that Department. 
       
       
      Now I will explain it to your client in a moment, Ms Clifford. 
       
      Ms Clifford and Ms Tabone, are there any formal orders I have not made which I need to make or correct? 
       
      TABONE: Your Honour, maybe in addition whilst the young person is going to be under the supervision of Juvenile Justice and attend education and employment training programmes perhaps there could be an additional condition about participating in any programmes with respect to an offence or drug related programmes or provisions by Juvenile Justice because the other conditions don’t - there’s nothing specific about drug. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: You’re quite right. 
       
       
      15. So far as condition (4), participating in any programme, I will amend that to participate in any programme provided by or recommended by the Department, especially programmes focused on drug and alcohol rehabilitation. 
       
       
      TABONE: Thank you, your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Ms Clifford, any other conditions? 
       
      CLIFFORD: No, your Honour, if your Honour pleases. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Ms Tabone, nothing else? 
       
      TABONE: No. 
       
      16. Okay. JJH, as I said, I have allowed your appeal and the twenty-one months is still in place. You are still in gaol for one year and nine months - or rather in custody - but I brought down the minimum time to one year so that you will be released on parole on 30 October 2008. Do you understand that? Then you have got nine months on parole and I have listed all those things you heard me list, which somebody will go through with you, to do with your rehabilitation, but basically you are to take the advice of the Department of Juvenile Justice. They are prepared to give you advice and they will help you find the right place for you to continue with your rehabilitation. It sounds as though you are doing well so far and I hope that you continue with that progress once you are released. I have got to keep you in custody for a certain amount of time because what you did, as I said, was very serious and it cannot happen. We cannot have people in the community doing that sort of thing, so that is why there has to be a certain amount of time in custody. 
       
        
         
        Do I need to make any order or direction about juvenile detention centre after he is aged eighteen because he turns eighteen whilst he is still in custody? 
         
        
       
      CLIFFORD: Your Honour, I don’t actually have number 2 with me today, 
       
      your Honour, but it’s my understanding that he remains and serves the sentence out as a juvenile if it is - if it’s a crime that they’ve committed as a juvenile and they have started the sentence as a juvenile they continue. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right.  
       
       
      TABONE: That was my understanding, your Honour, but I don’t have my volume 2 either. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. In case there is any doubt I recommend, and if I have the power I direct, that the whole of the term of custody be served in a juvenile detention centre. 
       
      CLIFFORD: Thank you, your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else? 
       
      TABONE: No, your Honour. 
       
      CLIFFORD: No, your Honour. 
       
      HIS HONOUR: Okay. Thanks. JJH, good luck. 
       
       oOo

    CRIMINAL LAW - Sentencing - Suspended sentence - Bond revoked - Non-parole period previously set - No power to re-set periodRES JUDICATA - Suspended sentence - Amending legislation - Bond revoked - Existing sentence not affected by amendmentThe applicant pleaded guilty to the manslaughter by neglect of her infant daughter who drowned in a bath when left unattended. In February 2006 she was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months but the sentence was suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 upon her entering into a good behaviour bond for 2 years. The bond was revoked after the commencement of the amendments to the Act which took effect in November 2006. The original sentence had not been formally entered. The Judge held that he had no power to reopen the non-parole period which had already been set and ordered that the sentence take effect. The applicant sought leave to appeal against the original sentence and the later order, following revocation of the bond, that it take effect. Held: (1) Since the sentence had not been formally entered the Judge had power to reconsider the original sentence, but a case for its reconsideration had not been established; 
     
      
    (2) The 2006 amendments and the transitional provisions did not give the Court which revoked the bond the power to reconsider the non-parole period originally set in the light of the situation when the bond was revoked; 
     
      
    (3) Amending legislation will not affect sentences which have already become res judicata in the absence of clear provisions to that effect.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HANDLEY AJA: On 12 March 1999 the applicant's 13 month old daughter drowned in a bath when the applicant left her unattended for 5 to 8 minutes. On 23 February 2006 she adhered to her plea of guilty to manslaughter before Sides QC DCJ. The sentencing Judge imposed a sentence of 2 years imprisonment, found special circumstances, set a non-parole period of 12 months, and suspended the sentence pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). He ordered that she be released from custody forthwith conditional upon her entering into a bond to be of good behaviour for two years subject to conditions. 
     
      
    2 On 2 November 2006, following a report from the Probation and Parole Service, the Judge exercised the power under s 98 to call on the applicant to appear before the Court. On 2 March 2007 he revoked the bond but admitted the applicant to bail pending an assessment of her suitability for periodic detention. On 2 April he received a report from the Probation and Parole Service that the applicant, although eligible, was unsuitable for periodic detention. The solicitor for the applicant invited the Judge to review the non-parole period he had previously set but the Judge responded: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I don’t have the power to do that, do I?"" 
        
       
      
    3 The solicitor referred to the amendments made by the Crimes and Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2006 (No 107) (the amendments) and the transitional provisions. The Judge said that since a non-parole period had already been set, s 99, as amended, did not require one to be set when the bond was revoked. The solicitor took the matter no further. The Judge then ordered that the sentence of two years imprisonment commence forthwith and that the applicant be released on parole on 1 April 2008. 
     
      
    4 On 31 August the applicant applied for leave to appeal challenging the Judge's decision that he had no power to reconsider the non-parole period, which was said to be manifestly excessive. There was no challenge to the decision to revoke the bond. During the hearing Ms Burgess, who appeared for the applicant, also sought leave to appeal out of time from the sentence imposed on 23 February 2006. The Crown did not challenge the competency of either application.  
     
      
    5 The power, under s 43, to reopen sentencing proceedings to correct legal error is available after the sentence has been perfected. Until this occurs the Court has an inherent power to reopen the proceedings. The first question then is whether the original sentence was perfected. Part 53 r 12 of the District Court Rules 1973 which was in force at the time provided:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Any judgment, order, sentence, direction or recommendation given or made by a Judge in any proceedings shall be entered on the indictment in the proceedings, and that entry shall, when signed by the Judge, be the record of the judgment, order, sentence, direction or recommendation."" 
        
       
      
    6 There is no definition of indictment in the District Court Act 1973 or Rules, but s 15(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that in Division 2, meaning presumably Part 2 of the Act, indictment ""includes a court attendance notice or any other process or document by which criminal proceedings are commenced.""  
     
      
    7 The relevant document was the court attendance notice filed in the Local Court at Fairfield on 5 August 2004. Inquiries by the Crown established that the sentence had not been entered on the court attendance notice. A typewritten copy signed by the Judge was attached to the cover of the District Court file. This was also endorsed with handwritten summaries of other orders and directions made in the proceedings. Under the new r 12, which came into force on 7 November 2007, entry of the sentence on the Court file, signed by the Judge, constitutes a formal record of the sentence.  
     
      
    8 The original sentence had not been perfected when the matter was before the Judge on 2 April 2007 and the Judge therefore had power to grant leave to re-open the sentencing proceedings: R v Elliott [2006] NSWCCA 305 para [44] and [45] per Spigelman CJ and the cases there cited. He inadvertently erred when deciding that he had no power to do this.  
     
      
    9 The power to reopen a judgment which has not been perfected is a discretionary power. In R v Elliott (above) para [48] the Chief Justice said that the dominant consideration is whether there would otherwise be a miscarriage of justice. In R v Lapa (No 2) (1995) 80 ACR 398, 403 Clarke JA said that the Court will accord great weight to the principle of finality and only grant an application for reconsideration in rare cases, and (at 405) that the need to remedy an oversight would be a proper ground.  
     
      
    10 On 8 November, after this Court reserved its decision, the High Court gave judgment in Elliott v The Queen [2007] HCA 51 paras [31]-[32], [41] and held that the power to reopen should only be exercised where there has been some misapprehension of the facts or the relevant law which was not caused by the neglect or default of the party seeking the rehearing.  
     
      
    11 The nature of the discretion has also been considered in civil cases. In Smith v NSW Bar Association (1992) 176 CLR 256, 265 Brennan, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The power is discretionary and, although it exists up until the entry of judgment, it is one that is exercised having regard to the public interest in maintaining the finality of litigation. Thus, if reasons for judgment have been given, the power is only exercised if there is some matter calling for review."" 
        
       
      
    12 In the present case there was nothing that called for review. The sentence as a whole was lenient, and no error of fact or principle has been established. In its context the non-parole period was not excessive, manifestly or otherwise. Moreover the applicant entered into the bond and took the benefit of the sentence. This weighs heavily against the grant of leave to reopen.  
     
      
    13 The principle of finality requires there to be some error, oversight or miscarriage in the original sentence which existed when the order was made even if it only became manifest in the light of subsequent events: compare Re Harrisons's Share (1955) Ch 260 CA. The power to reopen does not enable the Court to review a proper sentence in the light of subsequent developments. This Court, as a Court of error (Elliott v The Queen [2007] HCA 51 para [35]) can only consider such matters within the narrow limits referred to in R v Munday [1981] 2 NSWLR 177 and R v Ehrenburg NSW CCA (14 December 1990).  
     
      
    14 The subsequent events in this case were not the manifestation of something that was present, but not fully appreciated, at the date of that sentence: R v Ehrenburg (above) at p5. I would therefore grant leave to appeal out of time from the original sentence but dismiss the appeal.  
     
      
    15 The ground in the original application for leave to appeal was that the amendments, which relevantly commenced on 29 November 2006, conferred on the Court which revoked the bond the power to reconsider any non-parole period set as part of the original sentence.  
     
      
    16 Section 12(1) enables a sentence of imprisonment for not more than 2 years to be suspended and for the offender to be released on condition that he or she enters into a good behaviour bond. Subsection (3) originally provided:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Subject to section 99(1) Part 4 does not apply to a sentence of imprisonment the subject of an order under this section except to the extent to which it deals with setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence."" 
        
       
      
    17 In February 2006 the sentencing Judge was bound to set a non-parole period as part of the sentence to be suspended. Section 99(1)(c) then provided: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) If a Court revokes a good behaviour bond;  
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
        (c) in the case of a bond referred to in section 12: 
         
         (i) the order under section 12(1)(a) ceases to have effect in relation to the sentence of imprisonment suspended by the order, and  
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) Part 4 applies to the sentence, except to the extent to which it has already applied in relation to setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence, and  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) subject to the requirements of Part 4 having been complied with, the sentence takes effect.""  
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    18 Prior to the amendments the Act did not enable the Court which revoked a s 12 bond to revisit a non-parole period set as part of the original sentence: Wise v R [2006] NSWCCA 264 and the cases there cited. This Court had suggested, more than once, that the powers of the Court which revoked a bond were inadequate, and legislative reform was needed.  
     
      
    19 Parliament responded in 2006 and s 12(3) was amended by omitting the words ""except to the extent to which it deals with setting the non-parole period and the balance of the term of the sentence"". Section 99(1)(c) was amended by deleting sub-paras (ii) and (iii) and substituting:  
     
      
       
        
        ""(ii) Part 4 applies to the sentence, as if the sentence were being imposed by the Court following revocation of the good behaviour bond, and section 24 applies in relation to the setting of a non-parole period under that Part."" 
        
       
      
    20 In the absence of any transitional provision these amendments would only operate prospectively. Section 12(3) as amended provides that Pt 4 of the Act, including s 44 which requires the Court to set a non-parole period, does not apply to a sentence suspended under s 12. Suspended sentences imposed after the amendments will therefore not include a non-parole period. If a good behaviour bond, entered into after the amendments, is revoked s 99(1)(c), as amended, now requires the non-parole period to be set by the Court which revokes the bond.  
     
      
    21 Under these provisions the question of resetting an existing non-parole period could not arise. Section 99(2), which was not amended, confers, in terms, a power to vary an existing sentence to enable it to be served by way of periodic or home detention. The absence of any other power to vary an existing sentence is of some significance.  
     
      
    22 Parliament could have given the Court which revoked an existing bond the power to reset the non-parole period. Instead it conferred a power to set the non-parole period where it had not been set before, which could not affect suspended sentences where a non-parole period had already been set.  
     
      
    23 This construction of the amendments is supported by the strong presumption that a statutory amendment does not affect completed proceedings which have become res judicata unless it provides for this in clear terms: Lemm v Mitchell [1912] AC 400, 405-6: Day v Kelland [1900] 2 Ch 745 CA; FEDFA v Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (1913) 16 CLR 245, 258-9, 270-1, 272-3, 280; Re A Debtor (1936) Ch 237 CA, 243.  
     
      
    24 Criminal proceedings are completed and become res judicata when they are finally disposed of by sentence or otherwise: Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501, 509, 530. 
     
      
    25 This construction of the principal provisions, as amended, is subject to the transitional provisions inserted in Sch 2. Clause 56 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) The amendments made to sections 12 and 99 by the Crimes and Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2006 … extend to proceedings commenced (but not concluded) before the commencement of the amendments.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) The amendments made to section 99 by the Crimes and Courts Legislation Amendment Act 2006 extend to proceedings in respect of the revocation of a good behaviour bond entered into before the commencement of the amendments, subject to sub-clause (3).  
        
       
       
        
        (3) The amendments to section 99 do not require a non-parole period in respect of a sentence of imprisonment to be set on the revocation of a good behaviour bond entered into before the commencement of the amendments if the non-parole period was set at the time that the sentence was suspended."" 
        
       
      
    26 Clause 56(1) applies to prosecutions pending at the commencement of the amendments on 29 November 2006 and is not relevant. Sub-clause (2) made s 99, as amended, applicable to the proceedings for revocation of the applicant's bond initiated by the sentencing Judge on 2 November 2006, subject however to sub cl (3). The latter removed the duty to set the non-parole period that would otherwise have been imposed by sub cl (2). The transitional provisions did not confer any power to reset a non-parole period set by the Court which suspended the sentence.  
     
      
    27 In my judgment the amendments and transitional provisions did not confer any power on the Court which revoked an existing s 12 bond to reset the non-parole period. Thus the sentencing Judge did not err when he held that the transitional provisions did not confer this power. This Court has no power to review the non-parole period set on 23 February 2006 on an appeal from the Judge's decision of 2 April 2007. The following orders should therefore be made:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (1) Leave to appeal granted from the decisions of 23 February 2006 and 2 April 2007. 
           
           
          (2) Appeal dismissed. 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 HOEBEN J: I agree with Handley AJA and the orders he proposes.  
     
      
    29 SMART AJ: I agree with Handley AJA.
