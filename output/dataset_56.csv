2705410,R v Mason [2014] NSWDC 380,"Sentence


	
	HIS HONOUR: Dwayne Mason appears today for sentence in relation to an offence to which he pleaded guilty on 18 September 2013. An indictment was presented alleging against him that he on 8 January 2013, at Matraville in the State of New South Wales, wounded Courtney Lyons with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. To that charge he pleaded ‘not guilty’, but he pleaded ‘guilty’ to the alternative charge that he on the same day to the same place recklessly wounded the same person. This is a crime contrary to s 35(4) Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of seven years imprisonment, it has a standard non-parole period of three years imprisonment.
	
	
	The offender when he committed this offence, the facts of which I will deal with shortly from an agreed statement of facts, was on parole. He had been released to parole on 20 December 2012 thus he had been on parole at the time of the commission of the offence barely 18 or 19 days, I will deal with the circumstance of his living conditions in that period, but as the Crown has pointed out, and is readily conceded, the commission of an offence whilst subject to parole particularly after recent release with the prisoner giving the parole authorities no practical opportunity to assist him is a significant aggravation of the offending in the context of the provisions of s 21A(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	The matter on the Form 1 which will need to be taken into account is an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This was an offence as the facts reveal committed on the same victim at the time of the commission of the principal offence. This is an offence contrary to s 59(1) Crimes Act 1900 and if prosecuted separately would require fixing of a sentence by regard to a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. This sentencing exercise involves quite a number of technical issues which I have taken into account, some of which I will deal with later in the judgment, some of which I propose to deal with at the commencement of the judgment before I delve into the facts and the evidence available to me.
	
	
	Firstly, the plea of guilty was entered as I have pointed out in discharge of an indictment pleading a more serious offence. The plea of guilty was entered as I understand it after several days of negotiation and was entered two days after the matter was listed for trial. The plea of guilty thus was not entered at the first reasonable opportunity. The accused had been committed for trial but in the context of the accused pleading to a more serious charge and the character of the negotiations as I would understand it from the way in which the matter now comes forward to me, with one matter on a Form 1, and having heard carefully the submissions of both defence and the learned Crown, who was not involved in the negotiations I hasten to say, I have determined that in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton the discount to be accorded to the prisoner for the utilitarian benefit of his plea of guilty is 15%. I must say in that regard, in fairness to the prisoner, my understanding of the matter from the way the agreed facts are drafted given what apparently is some lack of cooperation from the victim who is the prisoner’s life partner, the prisoner’s plea was of considerable value insofar as I said the victim’s cooperation with the prosecution authorities at least at first instance was not complete.
	
	
	In relation to Form 1 matters, I am required to consider the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Attorney General’s Application Number 1 of 2002, (2002) 56 NSWLR 147, and particularly the observations of the learned Chief Justice between paras [18] and [44] but not including all of those paragraphs. His Honour for the Court pointed out that the fact that there are matters to be taken into account on a Form 1 means that greater weight should be given to the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution.
	


“The entire point of the process is (usually) to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of the sentence that would have been imposed if the principal offence for sentence stood alone.”


	
	His Honour pointed out that it was wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small, sometimes it will substantial depending upon the character of the principal offence and the character of the matters on the Form 1. However, the court was prompt to point out that the sentencing process is only concerned with the principal offence not to determine appropriate sentences for the matters listed on a Form 1. But, in fact, to see the principal offence if it is appropriate to do, as it is here, in the context of any matter or matters identified in the Form 1. It is clear on the facts of this matter that the matter on the Form 1 is part of the context of the offending in relation to the principal offence. It is very related in time. It is a separate offence but the criminality involved in it is very much subsumed into the criminality and the moral culpability of the prisoner in relation to the principal offence.
	
	
	That having been said one could not ignore the character of the offending in the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, giving weight to what the Court of Criminal Appeal said in the guideline judgment as to require deterrence and retribution to be given greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. Of course, there are limits to that and I have taken into account in the context of the totality of the offending and the intimate connection of the events. I will deal with the prisoner’s version of events in the psychiatric report shortly as it may be considered in the context of the agreed facts.
	
	
	I earlier mentioned that the prisoner was on parole at the time of the offending in respect of a sentence imposed upon him of three years with a non-parole period of 18 months that non-parole period expiring on 20 December 2012. I have earlier pointed out that that is a very significant aggravating factor.
	
	
	The offence of reckless wounding has a standard non-parole period, of course. The issue the appropriate approach to sentences with a standard non-parole period was made clear by the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock v R (2011) 144 CLR 120. I need not go to that judgment beyond noting the terms of the judgment between [17] and [29]. The High Court in that judgment, of course, was very much concerned with the old provision s 54B(2) that required the court “…. to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter.”
	
	
	Part 4 Division 1A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act was amended by legislation on 29 October 2013. The effects of those amendments are discussed in a discussion paper circulated to judicial officers, at least, in special bulletin 5 of January 2014. The learned author, Mr Donnelly, has pointed out that the amendments that now are reflected in s 54A(2) and s 54B(2) evince an intention that the standard non-parole period is not to have determinative significance in the sentencing exercise as was indicated by the High Court in Muldrock v R. Section 54A(2) provides that:
	


“For the purposes of sentencing an offender the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the Table to this Division that, taken into account only the objective factors affecting the relative seriousness of that offence, is in the middle of the range of seriousness.”


	
	Section 54B(2) states that:
	


“The standard non-parole period for an offence is a matter to be taken into account by the court in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender without limiting the matters that are otherwise required or permitted to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offender.”


	
	Thus, in considering the relevance as of the standard non-parole period to the sentencing exercise as now the legislation requires and the context of whatever can be surmised from the High Court decision of Muldrock, one is concerned with only the objective circumstances in reaching a decision in that regard and, of course, one must then turn to relevant mitigating factors that arise and what might be described as the “subjective” circumstances as well as consideration of s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
	
	
	In this matter, I have made a determination that there are ‘special circumstances’ pursuant to that latter provision for two reasons. One is that the sentence I am to impose will be by definition partly accumulative upon the balance of sentence arising out of the revocation of the accused’s parole after his return to custody on 11 January 2013. The other relevant matter arises from the very helpful report of Mr Simon West, City Community Corrections Office Sydney. Mr West I have known for the best part of 35 years. He is without doubt one of the most experienced Probation and Parole Service’s officers probably still serving who does not hold a senior administrative responsibility. His assessment of the offender in the context of the special circumstances issues that arise is that notwithstanding the revocation of his previous parole order he may benefit from a further period of supervision that would allow his behaviour in the community to be monitored and to give some support to him in helping him to address what will be difficult issues given the pattern of behaviour that he has developed in recent years. This opinion of Mr West in the context of all of the evidence, including the criminal history of the prisoner, persuades me that the offender needs an extended period of supervision in the community to assist him to adjust to community living and to address issues relating to his drug dependency, his drug abuse, his anger management, or his lack of anger management, and his relationship with his partner that in my view can only be provided by professional guidance and advice. The period of the balance of parole that I foreshadowed will be sufficient in my view for him to take up the opportunity if he wishes to take it. Of course, he previously did not take up that opportunity.
	
	
	I have mentioned the fact that I would turn to the objective facts. The agreed statement of facts includes a great deal of material which I need not quote setting out the basis upon which the Crown sought to prove its case in the context of what I understood to be a reluctant complainant particularly in the nature of hearsay representations made by the complainant whilst relevant events were fresh in her memory that would have identified the offender as the person who injured her. The prisoner had, as I said earlier, been released to parole on 20 December 2012. Apparently, at this stage he, originally from the South Coast, had his partner living or she was living at least of her own motion in Sydney. But he did not see much of her it would seem because he went on what he claims to be a two week bender of drug abuse particularly abuse of speed.
	
	
	The complainant went around to the home of a mutual friend, as I understand it, living in Anzac Parade Maroubra. The complainant was then living with the prisoner’s son who is her son in Matraville. She was allowed into the home to retrieve her keys from the offender. She took the offender’s bag and took the keys out of the bag and then she tapped the offender to wake him up. When he woke up the complainant said to the prisoner, “Why do you have to sleep at every cunt’s house?” This clearly was a reference to the fact that the prisoner had not been home after 18 months in custody, establishing a proper relationship with her and her son. The demeanour of the offender is described then to have changed. Apparently, he had a knife in his possession, he hit her and stabbed her left arm with the knife. He held his hands around her throat choking her and stabbed her on the back of her left shoulder during this assault.
	
	
	When she was examined at a nearby medical centre. She walked to the medical centre. She was taken by ambulance to the hospital. She had five reddening marks with signs of early bruising over her throat consistent with what is described as manual strangulation and two wounds, one to the back of her left shoulder area and one on the back of her left upper arm. They were treated at the hospital as I understand it with sutures. She was not hospitalised and she had on ultimate examination a laceration 1.5 centimetres long on her left shoulder with subcutaneous tissue visible and a laceration 2.5 centimetres long on the left upper arm with subcutaneous issue visible and some blood oozing from that wound. There is some suggestion of the fact that the victim had not realised that she was injured. But be that as it may, it is clear from the material contained within the agreed statement of facts and the representations made by the complainant that the offender’s conduct was not planned or deliberate. In fact, the Probation and Parole officer described it in context as “impulsive” or that the offending would have appeared to “occur on impulse.”
	
	
	The prisoner has given a version to the psychiatrist which I cannot accept. It seems to me to be a case of self-justification, although in fairness to the prisoner he is not a sophisticated man. I do not believe it is a fictitious story meant to deliberately put people off the true determination of what occurred. The prisoner had been abusing drugs and had taken some Xanax to calm himself down apparently having not slept for a number of days before being interrupted in his sleep by the victim. He said to the psychologist, “I woke up and was swinging the knife around, I thought it was Max. I was stressing out, I thought Max was coming back to get me, my brain just snapped.” What he is referring to is the fact that a man called Max had abused his host at the residence in Anzac Parade where he was staying and he felt threatened by Max and the knife was there for his self-protection.
	
	
	Even if he had been in a deep slumber and had been woken up and had not quite got his bearings and even when he initially lashed out he may not have appreciated that it was the complainant, although I very much doubt that that was true given that she spoke to him, by the time he got his fingers around her throat he must have known it was her. Self-evidently, that would be so. He was familiar with her. He had lived with her off and on since he was 14 years of age. There could have been no question that this attack upon the victim which occurred over a relatively short period of time did not involve him understanding the victim was his partner. The reports, both the psychiatric and the Probation and Parole report, reflect the fact that the prisoner has a very poor insight into controlling his violent impulses and this is such a case.
	
	
	But having said that when one considers the character of the wounds in the context of dealing with the principal offence, when one considers the minimal degree of consideration before he lashed out, the impulsiveness of it if that is the correct expression, when one considers the victim not being permanently disabled or seriously disabled or disfigured, albeit that she was clearly wounded, this offence was below the middle range of seriousness. But, again, in considering the appropriate sentence for this matter all matters considered not just the objective facts and the subjective matters there is to be factored in, of course, that related to it, intimately involved with it, was a separate offence involving the prisoner placing his hands around the neck of the victim.
	
	
	The prisoner’s criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency. It shows offending as a child back in 2004. The prisoner I point out being born in May 1987 and at the time of the offending he would have been 16 years of age and 17 years of age when dealt with in the Children’s Court. He is now, of course, 26 years of age about to turn 27. He is thus old enough now to take responsibility for himself.
	
	
	He has findings of guilt in the Children’s Court for assault occasioning actual bodily harm and damaging property and since becoming an adult he has been convicted of destroying and damaging property and receiving a community service order; escaping from police custody for which he was fined, it must have been a pretty minor matter; receiving a suspended jail sentence for damage to property which was revoked on call-up and required him to serve a sentence of eight months with a non-parole period of four months that sentence commencing as I would understand it on 4 October 2008. He has been convicted as an adult of possessing drugs.
	
	
	At the Bega District Court in 2009 he was also convicted of aggravated breaking and enter and commit serious indictable offence knowing people therein for which he was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of ten months with various conditions of supervision, and aggravated breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence with the same circumstance of aggravation pleaded for which he received the same sentence. His criminal history also includes driving offences of various types; conviction for common assault at Penrith Local Court for which he received six months imprisonment and a conviction importantly at the Sydney District Court on 14 December 2012 of aggravated entering dwelling with intent to inflict actual bodily harm for which he received a sentence of three years and for which he was on parole when he committed the offences with which I am concerned.
	
	
	He has also been in prison for being carried in a conveyance without the consent of the owner and has convictions for drug possession and the like. Those matters speak for themselves in the context that I have outlined. But in every person’s lifetime and circumstances there is other material to take into account, another side to the story to explain in part where the prisoner now stands.
	
	
	He is an Aboriginal man from the South Coast town of Moruya. His mother had a number of partners and he was a person clearly brought up in a very disadvantaged community with very disadvantaged circumstances dwelling upon him. He may have had an undiagnosed condition of ADD in the opinion of the psychiatrist whose report I will refer to shortly. He witnessed acts of domestic violence as I may have mentioned and he was shovelled around between aunts and grandparents, not uncommon for young Aboriginal people. The dispossession and displacement of Aboriginal people over many many years evidences, itself, most starkly in the circumstances of individuals coming to courts allegedly committing criminal offences.
	
	
	He became a binge drinker in his mid-teens and developed a dependency on various drugs particularly cannabis. He had problems at school with his education and left with his school certificate. He has had some work as a roofer, as an apprentice butcher, he has been involved in the fishing industry. He has also had various periods of unemployment. In the report prepared by the Probation and Probation Service relying not just on the history that he has given them but records that go back to his first supervision by the Service in 2007 when he served community service. His supervision in the past has been assessed as best ‘borderline’ and at worst ‘unsatisfactory’. He has had parole order revoked on two occasions, 2010 and 2013, and as I said his parole was revoked when he was arrested in relation to the current matter and he is now serving the balance of his sentence.
	
	
	I might digress just for one moment to go back to the technical issues that arise here. As has been pointed out by the parties I have got a discretion as to what I should do in terms of “backdating” if at all any sentence I impose. Given the fact that he has been in custody serving the balance of sentence and given the fact that I must take into account as an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2) the breach of conditional liberty.
	
	
	I have given the matter serious consideration particularly in the context of the observations of Simpson J in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal case of Callaghan handed down in 2006. The matter, of course, is constrained by the terms of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and there are some recent decisions which deal with that aspect of the matter. But in the context of not having the power to prospectively commence the sentence and also in the context of an endeavour to avoid the relevant double dipping of which her Honour spoke I have determined, with the revocation of parole effective from 11 January, that I should date the sentence from the date that he pleaded guilty, that is, backdate the sentence from today but to ensure that the sentence commences before today’s orders are made.
	
	
	The psychiatric report also deals with these matters of history. I have mentioned his relationship with the victim. As I said earlier he has known her according to the history that he gave the psychiatrist since he was 14 years of age. She became pregnant to him when she was 16 years of age and she had their child who is seven years old at this point when she was only 17 years of age. They obviously struggled in a range of ways in the context of social dislocation and no doubt great economic pressure. The prisoner should understand, not that he may be listening to anything that I say, but his continual abuse of alcohol and drugs and his violence towards his wife only puts further pressure upon her and on the welfare of his child. He must understand that unless he is prepared to take responsibility for himself and become a responsible parent he can inevitably look forward to a time in 20 years’ time when he might be sitting at the back of this court or some court like this and his son may be sitting in the dock where he currently sits relying upon, as mitigation, the suffering that he had from a father who was a drug abuser and constantly in gaol. He might reflect upon what future he wishes for his son when he is released to parole.
	
	
	Recently, the High Court in Bugmy v R [2013] HCA 37 discussed the relationship of Aboriginality to the sentencing of offenders. I do not propose to get into the rationale of the judgment because it was concerned with particular issues raised on the grant of special leave that do not apply here. The High Court in Bugmy, however, noted a number of matters which are pertinent to this sentencing exercise. It rejected a submission of the appellant that the court should take judicial notice of the systematic background of Aboriginal offenders as it was antithetical to “individualised justice” (at 41). But it also went onto make this observation, in the view of the majority:
	


“Aboriginal Australians as a group are subject to social and economic disadvantage measured across a range of indices but to recognise this is to say nothing about a particular offender. In any case in which it is sought to rely on an offender’s background of deprivation and mitigation of sentence it is necessary to point to material tending to establish that background.”


	
	One might have thought ultimately that was a matter of common sense. Their Honours, however, in Bugmy reaffirm what had been said by Wood J in the 1992 decision of Fernando, and also reflected upon the fact that, as their Honours expressed it in the judgment, that the disadvantages of Aboriginal people was a matter to be relevantly taken into account if the evidence was available that the court in sentencing an offender must provide individualised justice to that offender.
	
	
	Many years before the decision in Bugmy and the related decision of Munda concerning an appeal from the West Australian Full Court, Chief Commissioner Elliott Johnson QC concluded in the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody:
	


“It is important that we understand the legacy of todays’ history as it helps to explain the deep sense of injustice felt by Aboriginal people their disadvantage status today and the current attitudes towards non-Aboriginal people in society.

In this way it is one of the most important underlying issues that assist us to understand the disproportionate detention rates of Aboriginal people.”


	
	In Munda the Court approved what Justice Eames had said in the Victorian decision of Fuller Cust (2002) VR 496, that the application of the principles enunciated by Justice Brennan in the earlier decision of Neal v The Queen that a factor relevant to sentencing which arises from an offender’s Aboriginality is not:
	


“overlooked by a simplistic assumption that equal treatment of offenders means that differences in their individual circumstances related to their race (I am using the word in the judgment) should be ignored.”


	
	On the other hand in Munda the Court went on to point out that mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, but they must not be allowed to lead to the imposition of penalty that is disproportionate to the gravity of the incident offence. It is also worthwhile pointing out of course in Munda that that was a very very serious case of domestic violence where the High Court was very keen to point out that the victim was an Aboriginal woman and Aboriginal women are entitled to the same protection of the law as Aboriginal offenders. However, in particular communities it might be argued the High Court held that:
	


“General deterrence is little rational claim on the sentencing discretion in relation to crimes which are not premeditated. That argument has special force where prolonged and widespread social disadvantage has produced communities so demoralised and alienated that it is unreasonable to expect the conduct of individuals within those communities to be controlled by rational calculation of the consequences of this conduct. In such cases it may be said that heavy sentences are likely to be of little utility in reducing the general incidence of crime, especially crimes of passion.”


	
	Now I hasten to say of course in this matter I have not been given particular evidence about the prisoner’s community. Although I am familiar with South Coast Aboriginal Communities in a range of ways. But what I do accept relevant to this offender is that he is a young Aboriginal man, he has grown up in Aboriginal communities and he has lived a life of considerable disadvantage which has in many respects fashioned his attitude to his partner, has influenced his dependency upon drugs and may well given that the sense comprising effect of being a witness to domestic violence influenced his approach to anger management and the like.
	
	
	With regard to Dr Furst’s report, he does not diagnose any history of mental illness and there is no evidence of any major mental illness, putting aside the possibly undiagnosed condition of ADD which has no doubt if it existed impacted upon the capacity of the prisoner to achieve any form of decent educational standard. He determines from the history of offending and behavioural problems and the like that the offender meets the criteria for a ‘childhood conduct disorder’ and he probably has met the criteria for a diagnosis of ‘anti-social personality disorder’. His heavy drinking and cannabis and amphetamine abuse is consistent with a substance use disorder.
	
	
	His counsel in his helpful submissions, all of which I have taken into account, sought to see these matters in a more positive manner than perhaps they might likely be assessed. These matters as diagnoses of conditions that are available under ‘DSM 5’ criteria are all pointers to an incapacity of the offender to control himself socially and in other ways and a likelihood of acting out violently and in other ways contrary to the law.
	
	
	He states in his opinion that his offences are more likely a product of his general propensity to be easily angered and become violent. His lack of positive role models, his impulsivity and the effects of chronic substance abuse including methylamphetamine. He also felt that his sleep deprivation, his ingestion of Xanax and his emotional upset on the day he accepting as I would understand the doctor’s report the version given by the prisoner, were also contributing factors to his violent outburst with stabbing his partner.
	
	
	Even though I do reject the account given by the prisoner of his realisation of the victim being his partner rather than somebody else, that gives me no basis for rejecting other aspects of the history given by the prisoner, nor does it in the context of the agreed facts permit me to reject his account of acting impulsively without planning as I have pointed out.
	
	
	The problem however in relation to the prisoner is that in the context of having committed offences whilst on parole and in the context of the ‘purposes of sentencing’ under s 3A of the Act, making full allowance of his disadvantaged background, issues of general and personal deterrence, denunciation and making the prisoner accountable are important matters for the Court to take into account in sentencing.
	
	
	On the other hand the prisoner is still relatively young and there are some aspects of his presentation to the doctor pointed to by his learned counsel which give some indication that the prisoner is taking responsibility for his conduct and may be better amenable to the assistance of the Probation and Parole Service in a range of ways, particularly in addressing his drug and alcohol dependency and his anger and violent offending, both in custody before his release to parole and when he is released to parole.
	
	
	Dr Furst’s opinion was that with his significant drinking and substance abuse issues and his background of family dysfunction and anti-social attitudes the prisoner was generally immature and impulsive. The prognosis must be guarded and I think that is a very fair assessment. His best prospects of remaining abstinent in the future in reducing the risk of re-offending would be through engagement in suitable drug and alcohol counselling and/or residential drug and alcohol rehabilitation. Also, of course, addressing domestic violence and the need for the prisoner to take responsibility for himself and anger management, as well as parenting courses, would probably also be of benefit.
	
	
	I have already pointed out to the prisoner, and I mean no offence or insult to him, that the burden of raising his son clearly over recent years with him being in prison so often has fallen to his partner and it sets no example for his child for him to be in prison.
	
	
	The other aspect of this matter, in the context of issues relating to domestic violence, is for the prisoner to hear the words and heed the words of people such as Pat Dodson and his brother Michael Dodson, leaders of the Aboriginal community across Australia, concerning the need for Aboriginal men to take responsibility for themselves to stop blaming other people or other things for the inability to control aggression towards their partners. It is not the Aboriginal way to be violent to one’s partner and it is not part of Aboriginal culture to do that. Nobody has reasonably suggested that is so, either in this case or any other case. Ultimately, the matter comes back to a question of personal responsibility and I would hope the prisoner will take heed of the need for personal responsibility on his release.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept by reference to s 21A(3) mitigating factors that the injury suffered by the victim in the context of the type of injury contemplated by the legislation were not substantial. Clearly there was no planning in this offending. The plea of guilty is itself a mitigating factor under s 21A(3) and although the prisoner did not give evidence I am mindful of the account given by the psychiatrist and what the prisoner has said to the Probation and Parole officer.
	
	
	I am prepared to accept the prisoner has taken responsibility for his actions and reflects remorse or contrition which could be regarded as a mitigating factor. His plea of guilty is some evidence of that as his counsel pointed out.
	
	
	I have earlier referred to the various submissions were made by his counsel, many of them I have specifically addressed in the course of dealing with the facts in relation to this matter either expressly or implicitly. Material from the bar table suggesting the prisoner would wish to go back to the South Coast, perhaps his partner will follow him there. But the issue of her forgiveness of him or not with respect is neither here nor there. The prisoner should understand that his actions towards the victim required her to go and get medical treatment, to be picked up by an ambulance, to be taken to a hospital, to cause police to go looking for him, for him to be arrested, for the Parole Authority to meet and determine his fate. All these matters impose a burden upon services available to the community and impose a burden upon service providers which the prisoner I am sure does not fully appreciate. If he is able to behave himself which is a simple request of the community of him, and that includes the Aboriginal community, funds that are spent on such matters might be diverted to other people or other services that would better assist the prisoner and his community.
	
	
	In respect of his prospects of rehabilitation, as I said to his counsel, I would need a crystal ball to be able to make a prediction of that on balance in his favour. His past history is not encouraging. But, on the other hand, he is getting to the point now where given the period of time that he has been in custody he must be seriously reflecting upon what he needs to do when he is released to avoid coming back to custody. He has got to understand the reality of the matter that if he wants to get out and continue offending courts will just get sick and tired of providing any form of leniency or mercy or consideration to him and he will just face longer and longer terms of imprisonment with less and less likelihood of finding some special circumstances being made in his favour.
	
	
	I have had regard of course to the brief submissions of the Crown. I have addressed those I believe expressly in my remarks. In considering the appropriate disposal of the matter I have naturally, as I have pointed out, taken into account the report of the psychiatrist and the report of the Probation and Parole Service officer in the context of the principles that I have outlined. I trust that I have covered the feel to deliver this judgment ex tempore shortly after the conclusion of the submissions.
	
	
	Thus in relation to the matter to which the prisoner has pleaded guilty, you can stand up please Mr Mason.
	
	
	In respect of the principal offence, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of 16 months which commences on the date that you pleaded guilty 18 September 2013 and will expire on my calculation, I will get the Crown to correct me if I am wrong, or Mr Oates to correct me if I am wrong, on 17 January 2015.
	
	
	I fix in relation to that sentence a balance of sentence of 20 months. That sentence will expire on 17 September 2016. I direct that the offender be released to parole on 17 January 2015. I do not propose to fix conditions of parole, the Parole Authority will ask for and will be provided with my remarks on sentencing as will the Department of Corrective Services. I would encourage the prisoner to have the opportunity of undertaking such courses as are available in custody but I accept the submission of his counsel that the opportunity for him to engage in appropriate courses may be greater outside of the custodial setting.
	
	
	Are there any technical matters from you Mr Crown?
	
	
	LEE: No your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Any matters from you Mr Oates?
	
	
	OATES: Will your Honour consider ordering a transcript of the remarks on sentence?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you want me to ask?
	
	
	OATES: It has been my experience that they are not always transcribed.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR I will request that I be sent the draft remarks and I will revise them but they will come to me in the normal course anyway. Corrective Services insist I have never known of a sentence where I have not revised the remarks to tell you the truth, particularly if there has been a term of imprisonment imposed because Corrective Services ask for it.
	
	
	OATES: Unless I be misunderstood there are certain aspects of what your Honour has said I wish to bring home to my client with correct reference to the remarks that have fallen from the bench today.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: That’s very kind of you certainly if they revise them, if they come to me I will revise them as soon as I can. Now Mr Mason do you understand the sentence I have imposed.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Do you understand the commencement date and the non parole period.
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Mason I want you to clearly understand, I am not talking down to you, do you understand, I’m just trying to encourage if that’s the correct word. You may not care for a single thing that I’ve said but at the end of the day your partner is left with the care of your son and your relationship with her cannot continue if you continue to assault her and frankly and this is the bottom line, if you want to use methylamphetamine and cannabis well regrettably you will find yourself back to these courts I am sure very quickly.
	
	
	The only way that you’re going to avoid coming back to these courts is to address one of the significant issues that you’ve got and that is your dependency upon drugs. Lots of people in your circumstances and I know that there are many temptations and many pressures but the bottom line you went straight to drugs as soon as you got out last time, I know that. Your counsel tells me that and he gave some detail that I didn’t know from the other material about that and it boils down to you just taking responsibility for yourself.
	
	
	If you don’t want to take responsibility for yourself well just expect to spend a lot more time in prison. Anyway thank you very much I wish you well, thank you to the Corrective Services officers you are excused.

		24 March 2016",2014-03-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705416,R v Kelly [2014] NSWDC 34,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: In this matter, it was the disclosure by the offender of what he had done, in particular the criminal offences he committed, which led to the complainant going to police and him now facing a significant period in gaol. Offenders who voluntarily disclose their wrongdoing are rare and substantial leniency is often accorded them, but it remains a fundamental rule of sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of an offender's conduct. Here the offender's conduct was serious indeed.

2He took advantage of the vulnerability of the complainant on one occasion and then created vulnerability on another so that he could sexually assault her. Despite his voluntarily disclosure of the latter offences which led the complainant revealing to police all offences, it remains the case that the offender must go to gaol for a significant period of time.

3The offender met the complainant whilst they were both living in New Zealand in 2009. A friendship developed. It was clearly a close friendship but not as close as the offender desired. In particular, he wanted there to be a sexual component to their relationship but the complainant made it clear, apart from on one occasion which I will shortly mention, that she did not want such a relationship with the offender.

4At various points of time since 2009, the offender and the complainant have lived in the same premises often sharing the same bed. Whilst there has been physical contact, it has not been sexual apart from incidents I will now describe. In 2009, whilst they were sharing premises, the offender suggested to the complainant that she was treating him like a boyfriend but not having sex with him. He then asked the complainant to move out. At this point, the complainant agreed to have sex with the offender and a consensual sexual encounter took place. Following that, the complainant made it clear to the complainant that this was not something that she desired to recur.

5They moved to Australia separately but have regularly shared premises. In 2012 the offender was sharing a house in Glebe. There was a party held there in May 2012. After the party the complainant slept in the bedroom of the offender as was common practice. They did not share a bed but sometime in the morning the complainant woke to feel someone stroking her right side. She asked, ""What are you doing?"". He said, ""Sorry"" and returned to where he was sleeping. She went back to sleep but woke up a few hours later to see the offender standing next to her bed breathing heavily. He had his hand pressed against his penis outside his underwear. Once again she remonstrated with him and he returned to where he was sleeping.

6A short time later she again awoke. This time she could feel breath against the back of her neck. She turned around and saw the offender kneeling next to her bed. She said, ""What's going on, what the fuck is wrong with you?"" before the offender again went back to where he was sleeping.

7Not surprisingly in the morning the complainant confronted the offender about his actions. He said:

""It's because of what happened before, because we've had sexual contact before. I'm drawn to you. I don't know what it is but I'm just attached"".

8No charges arise out of that conduct.

9We now move to an unknown Sunday evening in June 2012. The offender and the complainant attended the Hillsong Church together. He took her home to Penrith where she was living at that time. They agreed that they would spend the night in the lounge room. They went to sleep fully clothed under blankets on separate couches. She woke to find the offender running his hands up and down the sides of her body before cupping her buttocks with his hands. She forcibly removed his hands and said, ""God, what the fuck"". The offender said, ""I'm sorry"". In no uncertain terms the complainant told the offender what to do, ""Get back on your fucking couch and go to fucking sleep"".

10Despite this, despite the complainant making it abundantly clear to the offender that his physical advances were unwelcome in the extreme, the complainant woke up again a short time later to find that the offender had placed his hands on her breasts and began cupping them with his hands. Once again she forcibly removed his hands and told him to ""fuck off"". The offender replied, ""I can't help it"" and the complainant said:

""Get the fuck away, get the fuck on your side, stay the fuck there, we'll talk about this shit in the morning"".

11When she woke up next ,still during the night, she discovered that the offender was lying on the floor next to her. She formed the impression that he had been standing over her and had lain down on the floor as she stirred. She asked him what he was doing and he replied, ""I don't know"". In the morning the complainant confronted the offender about his actions. He claimed he could not help it.

12It appears that the offender was of the belief that the pair were a couple. They engaged in another discussion about this and not having sex. The complainant declined to have sex with the offender. It appears that the offender then took matters into his own hands.

13On 11 October 2012 the complainant began staying at the offender's home in Glebe on a permanent basis. She slept in the lounge room. The offender lived at that address with two other housemates, one of whom he knew through the Hillsong Church.

14A couple of weeks later after the complainant moved in there was a Halloween party held at the Glebe address. The complainant remembers having about five cups of wine. She recalls asking the offender to get her a drink. The next morning she had a strong headache and was feeling queasy. She attributed this to her alcohol consumption and did not think much of it but a few days later the offender told the complainant what he had done. He said this:

""There's something I've got to tell you since we're being all open and honest. I've actually done some things to you. The night of the party I put sleeping pills in your drink.""

15He pointed to his penis and said, ""I put it in your mouth"". He said:

""I tried anal with you but I don't know if it was in or not. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, I'm going to work on it"".

16He began to cry and said:

""I can't go to gaol, I'm scared of gaol, I don't want to be branded a rapist"".

17The complainant began to cry when she was told of this. This of course is not at all surprising. The complainant did not immediately go to police. Other people were told. The complainant commenced a relationship with another person living in the Glebe address and moved into his room. Representatives of the Hillsong Church were made aware of what occurred and eventually on 20 November 2012 the complainant attended Glebe Police Station and reported what had happened.

18Some representatives of the Hillsong Church telephoned the offender on 29 November and asked him to come in for a chat. During the conversation which ensued, the offender admitted that he would go to where the victim was sleeping and feel her up, that is touch her breasts and vagina, that he would masturbate while standing over her while she was sleeping, that at the Halloween party on 27 October 2012 he put sleeping tablets in her drink and while she was drugged he got the complainant to perform oral sex on him and tried to have anal sex with her but he was not sure if he penetrated her.

19Later still police intercepted a number of telephone conversations between the complainant and the offender. At one stage he said this:

""You know I had, it wasn't just the whole feeling you up, that I'd actually put sleeping pills in your drink once and yeah, I had like oral sex with you and yeah, and maybe anal, that's, I don't know, I couldn't tell and that's it"".

20He then apologised to the complainant. He was arrested the same day.

21The offender has no prior convictions. He has no real excuse for his conduct. It appears that he was obsessed with having a sexual relationship with the complainant and when she would not agree to this he took advantage of her vulnerability when she was sleeping and actually brought about her vulnerability by drugging her so that he could sexually assault her in two serious ways indeed.

22He suggested to the author of the pre-sentence report and the author of a psychological report tendered today that his upbringing was less than ideal, but there is little in what he complained about to explain why he would do what he did to the complainant in this manner. 

23As far as his work history is concerned he has had no problems getting a job in the past. He reported some learning difficulties but has nevertheless been able to complete training with the Hillsong Church and plans to pursue further tertiary studies. His IQ is in the normal range.

24He has a history of drug use and alcohol abuse but there is no suggestion that any of his misconduct occurred in the context of him being intoxicated or that he was otherwise acting out of character. He told the author of the pre-sentence report that the basis of his relationship with the complainant stemmed from him providing a caring and protecting role as opposed to a sexual relationship. He acknowledged that this was an underlying source of tension in the relationship and he considered his offending to have occurred in this context.

25It should not need to be said but it must be: People are entitled to refuse sexual contact with friends just as much as they are entitled to refuse sexual contact with strangers. Nothing in the relationship between the complainant and the offender could in any way justify his repeated offending. 

26The first two offences of indecent assault occurred in the complainant's home and the second occurred after she had made it abundantly clear that what he did on the first occasion was most unwelcome. Then on the next occasion he used a sleeping tablet which had been prescribed to him, because of difficulties that he had had sleeping, to place the complainant in a position where she was completely unable to defend herself against his unwanted sexual activities.

27The offender now faces sentence for two offences of indecent assault, an offence of using an intoxicating substance to commit an indictable offence, that carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, and two offences involving sexual intercourse without consent, one an attempt. They both carry 14 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years. I have taken into account in all cases the maximum penalties and where appropriate the standard non-parole periods in determining the appropriate sentences to impose in this case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period appear in these remarks on sentence.

28Consistent with the offender's voluntary disclosure of his guilt in relation to the offences committed at the Halloween party, he pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. The sentence I impose upon him will be thus 25% less to reflect the utilitarian value of his pleas.

29As well, his pleas of guilty and his voluntary disclosure say a great deal about his remorse. Although he did not give evidence before me, I nevertheless accept that he was remorseful for what he has done because he voluntarily admitted to the complainant what he had done to her after he had drugged her, recognising that there was a significant risk that he would to gaol because of his revelations.

30Notwithstanding the seriousness of his conduct, in other areas he has a good character and has good prospects of rehabilitation. It is to be hoped that these offences arose out of unique circumstances and will thus not ever be repeated. Despite that, personal deterrence is not irrelevant in this case and of course general deterrence remains of prime importance.

31Ms Sten who appeared for the offender today recognised that a sentence of imprisonment was required. She submitted that if the sentence I chose was two years or less, then an intensive corrections order may be appropriate. I regret to say that a sentence of two years would be wholly inadequate given the objective gravity of the offender's conduct, even recognising that it was the offender's voluntary disclosure of what he had done at the Halloween party which has led to him facing these charges.

32I impose sentence as follows. For the two offences of indecent assault, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months to date from 6 March 2014. For the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 6 September 2014 with a head sentence of five years. The offence of attempting sexual intercourse without consent, I impose a non-parole period of two years with a head sentence of five years, also to date from 6 September 2014. For the offence of using an intoxicating substance to commit an indictable offence, I impose a non-parole period of three years to date from 6 September 2015 with a head sentence of six years. The non-parole period will expire on 5 September 2018 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole. The overall sentence I have imposed is one consisting with an effective non-parole period of four and a half years and a head sentence of seven and a half years.

		16 April 2014",2014-03-05 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705422,R v Ryan [2014] NSWDC 53,"Sentence


1HIS HONOUR: Family feuds can arise from the most minor issues. What led to the offender bashing his nephew with a cricket bat, and assaulting a security guard as well, with the necessary result that the offender must spend a very long time in gaol, was the inadvertent failure to repay of a debt of a mere $100. 

2Michael Ryan and his girlfriend, Catrina Lee, borrowed $500 from Michael Ryan's uncle, Matthew Ryan, the offender in this case, and his girlfriend, Christy Melcham. There was an agreement that it would be repaid at $100 per fortnight. Because those repaying the loan miscalculated, the final payment was missed. Rather than this being sorted out amicably things were said, tempers were raised, and threats were made. The Ryan family split in two, yet both families lived in Muswellbrook, a relatively small country town, where one side of the family crossing paths with the other was inevitable. It appears that Michael Ryan may well have been involved in damaging the offender's home, certainly the offender believed that he had been. And so it was that on 18 November 2011 the two sides of the family came together in a very violent way. 

3The offender approached his sister at the Royal Hotel in Muswellbrook; he threatened her and left. Michael, the son of the lady who had just been threatened, saw his younger brother, Brody, outside the hotel and was concerned for his welfare. He therefore left the hotel and circumnavigated it trying to find Brody. He was unsuccessful, but as he was running back towards the hotel he noticed the offender and Christy Melcham up ahead of him. His evidence at trial was that the offender stood in front of him with a knife in his hand and that when he, Michael Ryan, raised his hands to protect himself, they were slashed. The offender was charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, as a result but he was acquitted of this charge and the alternative. The defence case at trial was that it was Christy Melcham who had been in possession of the knife and who had caused the injuries to Michael Ryan's hands. Consistent with the jury's verdict, I will sentence the offender on the basis that that is what occurred.

4After his hands were slashed, causing very deep wounds which later required him being transported to Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney and undergoing surgery there, Michael Ryan ran away. One of the security guards from the hotel, attracted by the commotion, was outside. Michael Ryan ran behind the security guard, Mr Pemberthy, using him as a shield. Matthew Ryan had brought a cricket bat with him to the hotel. He pulled it out of his tracksuit pants and began to use it, firstly on Mr Pemberthy, the unfortunate security guard being used as a shield, and then after Mr Pemberthy collapsed to the ground, chasing after Michael Ryan so that he could bash him with the cricket bat as well.

5The offender pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm relating to his attack on Mr Pemberthy and was found guilty by a jury of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm relating to his bashing of his nephew. The plea of guilty concerning the assault on Mr Pemberthy was entered fairly late but the offender had indicated a willingness to plead to that offence to the Director of Public Prosecutions at an earlier time. The sentence I impose upon him for that matter will be reduced by approximately 15% as a result.

6I also note in this context that he pleaded guilty to the alternative charge relating to the bashing of Michael Ryan with a cricket bat. That limited the issues at trial and that plea had a utilitarian benefit, which I will reflect in the sentence for the wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm upon Michael Ryan.

7Although what happened when Michael Ryan's hands were slashed at the front of the hotel was not captured on closed circuit television, the attack on Mr Pemberthy at the side of the hotel and the attack upon Michael Ryan at the rear of the hotel, were. Recordings of the CCTV footage were played in Court during the trial. Those recordings revealed in a graphic and truly horrible way the manner in which the offender used the cricket bat on the completely innocent Mr Pemberthy and the significantly injured Michael Ryan. Fortunately and perhaps even miraculously, Mr Pemberthy was able to get up after he was attacked by Matthew Ryan, the offender, but Michael Ryan was not so fortunate. It is to be remembered that he was scarcely in a position to defend himself. His hands had suffered serious wounds but nevertheless while lying on the ground he attempted to fend off the blows which were raining down upon him. The CCTV footage shows the offender raising the bat above his head, holding onto the handle with two hands and hitting Michael Ryan with considerable force indeed. It is apparent also, from the footage, that the offender moves around the body of Michael Ryan as he attempts to find a way to strike Michael Ryan to the greatest effect. In all, the offender used the bat upon Michael Ryan something in the order of ten or 12 times, each time appearing to use as much force as he possibly could. He only stopped when a further security guard intervened. Again it is something of a miracle that Michael Ryan was not more severely injured or even killed. He suffered a wound to his head which required suturing and a number of other injuries. Although he is left with scar on his scalp there are no other residual effects, at least in physical terms, from the beating he received from his uncle. 

8The maximum penalty for the offence involving Mr Pemberthy is imprisonment for five years. The maximum penalty for the offence involving Michael Ryan is 25 years with a standard non-parole period of seven years. I have taken the maximum penalties and standard non-parole period into account in determining the appropriate sentences in the present case. My reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period are to be found in these remarks on sentence.

9The offender is 30 years of age. Since leaving school he has had some employment as a labourer and before that in the upholstery industry with his father. But for the last six years he has been unemployed. That was, so he told the author of a pre-sentence report, because he had sole care for his two youngest children. He also has an older child from a previous relationship who is a ward of the State in Queensland and at the time the pre-sentence report was prepared, had a partner who was then pregnant with the offender's child. His two youngest children live with his mother and have done so since I refused the offender bail after his conviction by the jury.

10He has a criminal history but not for offences of violence. Given the nature of the offences on his criminal history it is no surprise to learn that the offender has had problems with alcohol and drugs for many years. He has tried to deal with these problems in the past, entering detoxification on three occasions, in 2005, 2006 and 2007. Clearly that has been largely unsuccessful. While on a good behaviour bond in 2011 it was proposed that he would enter rehabilitation again but he committed the offences for which I must sentence him before he could enter that program. 

11At the time of this offence he was on a s 12 bond for a drink driving matter. Given the circumstance that he relies on the fact that he was caring for two of his children before I refused him bail, it is important to note that at the time of his high range PCA matter, when he had a blood alcohol level over 0.15, his two youngest children were in the car with him. The conviction as a result of the events of 18 November 2011 clearly represent breaches of the s 12 bond. With the offender's consent I will deal with the consequences of that breach. It is important to note that I will not double count . As will be made clear when I impose sentence, the offender will do some time in custody solely related to the PCA matter. It would be double counting to regard breach of the s 12 bond as an aggravating factor in addition.

12Somewhat surprisingly, despite the horrific assault which the offender perpetrated upon his nephew, and the assault on Mr Pemberthy, the presentence report notes that the offender continued to direct anger towards the victim in regards to the events that led to the current offence. Although it was said that he expressed remorse, that was apparently only for the impact his actions had on his immediate family. There is nothing at all in the presentence report to suggest that the offender has taken responsibility for his actions. Today, a report by psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, was tendered. In that Mr Watson-Munro says that the offender continues to profess his innocence, consistent with the presentence report. But in giving evidence today the offender explained that both the author of the presentence report and the author of the psychological report had made mistakes. He said that he was remorseful, saying that he was sorry for the injuries suffered by the victim. In circumstances where both the presentence report and the psychological report expressed similar things about the offender's attitude towards the offence, in circumstances where how such mistakes could be made by those authors was not explained, and in circumstances where the offender's expressed remorse comes very much at the 11th hour, I do not accept that what he said in the witness box was genuine. I do not accept that he is sorry for the injuries suffered by, at the least, Michael Ryan.

13The offender's upbringing has involved some recent sad circumstances. His father, who had been ill for some time, died shortly before this trial and the family had earlier suffered from the tragic suicide of the offender's older brother. It is perhaps understandable, given such tragedies, that the offender might resort to an excess consumption of alcohol, especially given the circumstance that drinking was relatively commonplace as he grew up. The offender is depressed; part of that, of course, will be a reaction to the circumstances in which he finds himself in custody while his mother, now 63 years of age and suffering from arthritis, has been left to bring up his children. 

14The offender says he was also using large amounts of amphetamines at the time of this offence. I do have to say that it is difficult to see that that is a mitigating circumstances. The offender's consumption of ice was entirely voluntary and, after all, it cannot be overlooked that each time he consumed ice he was committing an illegal act. 

15Although a submission was not made that I would find hardship to third parties such that I could reduce the sentence accordingly, I will say this: it is terribly sad for the offender's children that he is in gaol and must remain there for some time. It is terribly sad for the offender's mother that she, after having lost one of her sons to suicide now finds the offender in custody. It is terribly sad for her too, that she must shoulder the burden, a burden I understand she willingly accepts but it is a burden nevertheless, of bringing up the offender's children. Unfortunately, consequences such as these are commonplace. Nevertheless, I accept that the offender will do his time in custody harder knowing that it is his misconduct which has caused harm, directly, to his mother and his children. I also note that he will do his time in custody harder because of the mental health issues which have been raised in the psychological report.

16The offender retains a great deal of family support. As I mentioned earlier he has worked in the upholstery industry for a number of years. His father was an upholsterer and from the age of eight the offender assisted him. He plans upon release from custody to enter that trade after completing appropriate TAFE courses. It is to be hoped that he might be able to do some of those courses and gain considerable experience whilst in custody. I recommend to the prison authorities that if work and courses involving upholstery are available in prison that upon the offender's request he be incarcerated in an institution where such courses and work are available. 

17It is true that the offender's actions on this night appear to have been out of character. The absence of any other offence of violence on the offender's criminal history is testament to that. But it was not out of character for him to be intoxicated. He clearly has a great deal of trouble dealing with his addictions. The lack of any lasting benefit from his various rehabilitative efforts in the past suggests that he will have trouble upon release from custody in staying drug free and in not abusing alcohol to excess. Whilst I am satisfied that he has good prospects of rehabilitation as far as offences of violence are concerned, I cannot say the same thing about offending of every kind given the relationship between his prior criminal history and his drug and alcohol use. 

18There are clearly special circumstances in this matter. They relate to issues of accumulation, his mental health issues, in particular his troubles with addiction to alcohol and drugs, and it is in both the community's interests and the offender's interests that he be offered an extended period of supervision upon parole in order to maximise that chance that he will not commit further offences. Nevertheless, a lengthy non-parole period is required to reflect the objective gravity of the offender's most violent conduct on 18 November 2011.

19I make the following orders. In relation to the s 12 matter I revoke the order for suspension and impose a non-parole period of nine months to date from 18 November 2012. For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm upon Stanley Pemberthy I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to date from 18 February 2013. For the offence of wounding Michael Ryan with intent to cause grievous bodily harm I impose a non-parole period of four years to date from 18 November 2013 and a head sentence of seven years. 

20The overall sentence will thus be one consisting of an effective nonparole period of five years and a head sentence of eight years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 17 November 2017.

		14 May 2014",2014-03-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705424,R v Clarke [2014] NSWDC 35,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: The offence to which Joshua Jack Clarke has pleaded guilty carries with it a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard nonparole period of ten years. The parties today have reminded me of what I earlier said about sentencing for offences of this type. In R v Le [2010] NSWDC 229 I said that from information available to me, sentences imposed upon those convicted of cultivating a large commercial quantity of cannabis by enhanced indoor means do not appear to have reflected the seriousness with which the legislature says such offences should be treated. Nothing I have seen since handing that decision down in October 2010 has caused me to alter my view. 

2Nevertheless, as I noted in Le, it is not for me to take an idiosyncratic view, different from those of my judicial brethren, and more importantly it is not for me to take a view inconsistent with that of the Court of Criminal Appeal when it has considered appeals regarding sentences for offences of this type. 

3It is important to note, however, that I should not simply pay lip service to two significant matters which I must bear in mind in determining the appropriate sentence, the maximum penalty of 20 years, and the standard nonparole period of ten years. I have taken both of those into account in determining the appropriate sentence. My reasons for not imposing the standard nonparole period appear in these remarks on sentence. 

4The offender worked as an employee in a very large scale commercial cannabis growing operation. For reasons I gave in an earlier judgment, it is impossible to be accurate about the precise number of plants that were growing when police appeared at the premises where the offender was working and seized cannabis material, however I can say that the number of growing cannabis plants was close to 2,000 and anything that was not a plant, because it did not have a root, would probably have shortly become a plant. It is to be borne in mind that the commercial quantity of cannabis plants for this offence is 200. This is enough to indicate the scale of the operation. 

5During the course of an issue regarding disputed facts, a search video was played to me. It demonstrated in graphic terms just how large scale this operation was. It confirmed other evidence, particularly photographs tendered by the prosecution and the descriptions contained in the statement of facts and the statement of an officer who went to the premises, that this was not some mere backyard operation or even an operation in a suburban house, this was an operation which had as its object the cultivation and thus distribution of a large amount of cannabis. 

6When comparing the sentence I impose on this offender with the sentences imposed on other offenders, the scale of this operation has to be borne in mind. That is not, of course, to suggest that the number of plants involved in this case is determinative of the sentence, but it is to say that the scale of the operation is important in assessing the offender's objective criminality, which in turn is a very important matter in selecting the appropriate sentence to impose upon him. 

7Police went to rural premises on 8 November 2012. The property they went to is 100 acres with a Colorbond shed on it, as well as other sheds. Within the main shed police found a bedroom with closed-circuit television equipment, enabling someone inside the bedroom to see what was happening outside. Also within the shed they discovered a large number of cannabis plants, as I said earlier something in the order of 2,000. They were in various stages of growth, ranging from small plants of about 10 centimetres in height, up to plants of a metre in height. In another shed concealed by hay bales were a further nine cannabis plants. 

8Of course it is not only the plants that were discovered. The growing equipment was also there, growing beds, electricity transformers, fans, humidifiers, lights, ducting, hoses, growing medium and fertilisers. Whoever set this up must have spent a lot of time and a lot of money, clearly intending to make a lot of money in return. 

9The offender, as I have said, was at the premises and was arrested by police. Other things were found, indicating the likely nature of his role. The Crown does not suggest that he was involved in setting up the operation or financing it. The Crown accepts, and so does Mr Turnbull, that he was acting as an employee, receiving instructions as to what to do and carrying them out. 

10The evidence suggests that he had been there for a significant period of time. He says four weeks to the author of a psychological report. Of course the precise time that he was involved in this operation and the precise amount of money that he expected to receive is difficult to determine. I will sentence him on the basis that he was paid to do what he did and he did it for about a month.

11The offender said that he got involved in this after he lost his job due to a downturn in work. He was a drug user and his drug supplier suggested this as a means of making some money. He accepts now that he should not have done that. 

12Expressions of remorse are to be found in various documents tendered to me, although I do have to say that it would have been better for the offender had he been prepared to express his remorse in evidence before me and perhaps if he had indicated his remorse was based more on the wrongfulness of his conduct rather than the effect of his behaviour on himself and his loved ones.

13The offender has had a very difficult background. He is now 26 years of age, but, of course, the impact of his background remains with him. His parents had something of a disharmonious relationship which ended when his father died when he was about eight years of age. His mother appears not to have been able to adequately cope with that sad event. The offender's grandmother reports that the offender was brought up after his father died in somewhat squalid circumstances. In those circumstances things changed again when his mother died when he was about 14 years of age and he was informally adopted by a family friend where he lived for about five years.

14At one stage the offender was associating with an outlaw motorcycle group. He went along to a clubhouse for a drink, met some people who knew his father and it was not long before he was involved in their activities, including illegal activities. It was in these circumstances that the offender committed a most serious offence for which he was sent to gaol - an offence of discharging a firearm at a dwelling house with disregard for public safety. Upon his release from custody he was supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and apart from one driving offence did well on parole. 

15There is another aspect of the offender's childhood, which no doubt affected him deeply. He was sexually assaulted by an employer when he was 13 years of age. Not surprisingly, therefore, given what has happened to him, losing his father, being raised in squalid circumstances, being sexually assaulted and then losing his mother, the psychologist reports that he displays symptoms of depression. Since going into custody he has been prescribed anti-depressants. He has had the insight to seek the advice and assistance of a psychologist while in custody, but unfortunately given that he has been bail refused on remand access to such services is limited. It is to be hoped that things will improve after I sentence him today.

16He has a great deal of support available to him. That is made clear both in writing and by the presence in court of many people who wish him well and will assist him upon his release from custody. 

17There are prospects for his rehabilitation. I cannot say that they are good, but I can say that with the assistance of the Probation and Parole Service upon his release from custody and with the assistance of those who are willing to support him there are prospects that he will be able to once again begin leading a productive life, as he was after his release from custody on the earlier occasion until he lost his job and got involved in this most serious criminal activity.

18The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Ordinarily that would almost automatically entitle him to a reduction on the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by 25% to reflect the utilitarian value of his plea. There was, however, a disputed facts hearing which required the attendance of an expert from Goulburn and a small amount of court time. Ultimately that matter was resolved in a way which did not significantly assist the offender, but given the finding I have made the effect on the utilitarian value of his plea was marginal. I will discount the sentence I would have otherwise imposed by 25%. 

19There is also a Form 1 attached to the offence for which the offender must be sentenced. I can say that there is such an overlap between the offence on the Form 1 and the offence for which I must specifically sentence him that there will be no extra punishment as a result of the Form 1 matter.

20It remains, of course, a fundamental rule in sentencing that a sentence must reflect the objective gravity of the offender's conduct and it remains also the case that in determining the objective gravity of an offence of cultivating cannabis the size of the operation is a significant factor. This is not only because of the potential harm that is caused by the offending with significant quantities of drugs being distributed if the operation is successful, but also because a person who is cultivating cannabis is fully aware of the scale of the operation, as it was it this case. The offender well knew what he was doing. He well knew the size of the operation and he thus well knew how seriously criminal his behaviour was. 

21The sentence I am about to impose has a non-parole period of significantly less than ten years. Were it not for the matters with which I began these remarks on sentence I would have chosen a much longer non-parole period. 

22There are special circumstances in this case. The offender's background is such that, its effects will last for sometime. The assistance of the Probation and Parole Service for an extended period will assist him to stay out of trouble, which, of course, will be of benefit to the community. I thus make a finding of special circumstances in his favour.

23Taking into account the matter on the Form 1 I impose a sentence as follows: There is to be a non-parole period of four years to date from 8 November 2012 and a head sentence of seven years. The non-parole period will expire on 7 November 2016, on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.

		16 April 2014",2014-03-06 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705428,State of New South Wales v Phillips [2014] NSWSC 205,"JudgmentINTRODUCTION1By summons filed on 28 February 2014 the plaintiff seeks the following orders pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (""the Act""):
Preliminary hearing
1 An order pursuant to section 15(4) of the Act:
a. Appointing two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations by a date to be fixed by the Court;
b. Directing the defendant to attend those examinations.Interim orders
2. An order pursuant to section 18B of the Act that the defendant be subject to an interim detention order from 9 March 2014 for a period of 28 days. 
3. An order pursuant to section 20(1) of the Act that the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the duration of the interim order referred to in paragraph 2 above.
4. In the alternative to paragraphs 2 and 3 above, an order pursuant to section 10B of the Act that the defendant be subject to an interim supervision order from the date of the order for a period of 28 days, and pursuant to section 11 of the Act direct that for the period of the interim supervision order, the defendant comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule to this Summons.
Final relief
5. An order pursuant to the section 17(1)(b) of the Act that the defendant be the subject of a continuing detention order for a period of 12 months from the date of the order, or for such time as the Court may deem appropriate.
6. An order pursuant to section 20(1) of the Act that the Court issue a warrant for the committal of the defendant to a correctional centre for the period specified in paragraph 4 above.
7 In the alternative to paragraphs 5 and 6 above, an order that pursuant to section 17(1)(a) of the Act, the defendant be subject to an extended supervision order for a period of 5 years from the date of the order, or for such time as the Court may deem appropriate, and pursuant to section 11 of the Act direct that the defendant comply with the conditions set out in the Schedule to this Summons.
2At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing on 7 March 2014, and because of the urgency of the matter, I made the orders set out in paragraph [50] below but I was not, at that time, in a position to set out my reasons for doing so.  Those reasons now follow.  
EVENTS LEADING UP TO THE PRESENT APPLICATION3Before dealing with the application itself, and consistent with what I said to the parties at the commencement of the preliminary hearing, it is necessary for me to make a number of observations about the events leading up to the making of the present application.  
4On 24 April 1991 the defendant was found guilty by a jury of the murder of Irene Glanville.  On 21 May 1991 he was sentenced by Mathews J to a minimum term of 15 years imprisonment to date from 10 March 1990 and to expire on 9 March 2005, with an additional term of 9 years imprisonment to date from 10 March 2005 and to expire on 9 March 2014.  The defendant has not, at any time, made an application for parole.  Indeed on the evidence before me he has, on more than one occasion, expressed a desire to serve the entirety of the sentence which was imposed.  
5In these circumstances, the fact that the defendant was due for release at the expiration of his sentence on 9 March 2014 could hardly have come as a surprise to anyone.  Notwithstanding that, the evidence before me establishes that the Attorney-General's Department did not seek advice from the Crown Solicitor about the merits of an application under the Act until 27 November 2013.  Having regard to the provisions of s. 6(2) of the Act, if an application under the Act were thought appropriate it could have been brought as early as September 2013.  In circumstances where the imminent release of the defendant was obvious, no explanation has been forthcoming as to why it was that advice was not sought from the Crown Solicitor until some months after that.    
6That unexplained delay in seeking advice was then compounded by what occurred, or more accurately what did not occur, when instructions were received by the Crown Solicitor.  For the reasons to which I have already referred, the imminent release of the defendant, and the resultant necessity to deal with matter urgently, must have been obvious.  However on the evidence before me, and instructions having been received in the Crown Solicitor's office on 27 November 2013, no step was taken by anyone on behalf of the Crown Solicitor until 8 January 2014, at which time orders were issued pursuant to s. 25 of the Act.  In other words, in circumstances where it was obviously urgent, the matter lay completely dormant in the office of the Crown Solicitor for a period of almost 6 weeks following the receipt of instructions.  
7Between 10 January 2014 and 13 February 2014 the Crown Solicitor's Office received a number of documents, reports and other information in response to the orders issued pursuant to s. 25.  A risk management report was received on 3 February 2014.  Following receipt of that material counsel was briefed to provide advice on 14 February 2014.  Advice was provided by counsel on 27 February 2014.  On the same date, the Crown Solicitor received instructions from the Attorney-General to commence the current proceedings.
8Those instructions having been received, the matter came before Garling J on 28 February 2014.  On that occasion, his Honour made a number of orders, one of which required that the summons, affidavit and notice of motion be served on the defendant on or before 4:00 pm the following day, 1 March 2014.  According to the record of the proceedings on that day, that order was made with the consent of the plaintiff.  It is therefore to be assumed that the plaintiff had come to the view that service could be effected within the time ordered by his Honour.  Notwithstanding this, I am given to understand that service of the material was not effected on the defendant until Monday 3 March 2014, in circumstances where a preliminary hearing had been listed to take place on Friday 7 March 2014.
9At the time of service of the various documents the defendant was in custody in Junee.  He was obviously required to be in Sydney for the preliminary hearing.  The necessity for him to travel from Junee to Sydney over the ensuing days rendered it impossible for him to speak with his legal representatives and provide instructions about the orders being sought by the plaintiff.  It was for this reason that when the matter came before me on the morning of 7 March, I delayed its commencement for a short period to provide counsel with an opportunity to confer with the defendant.  This was the very first occasion on which counsel had been given that opportunity.    10The combination of events to which I have referred gave rise to a situation which was highly unsatisfactory.  The cause of that situation can be traced back to the circumstances surrounding the provision of instructions to the Crown Solicitor, and the events which followed in the weeks thereafter.  
11This is not the first occasion on which I have been forced to express my concerns about delays in the bringing of applications under the Act.  I am also aware that a number of other Judges of the court have expressed similar concerns.  In the context of the present case, a number of specific matters warrant comment.  
12Firstly, an application under the Act in respect of the present defendant could have been brought as early as September 2013.  Advice as to the merits of an application could have been sought even earlier than that.  In those circumstances, and given that the defendant's impending release cannot have been a surprise to anyone, I am not able to understand why it was that advice was not sought from the Crown Solicitor until the latter part of November 2013.  
13Secondly, and in circumstances where there was an obvious necessity to deal with the matter urgently, not a single step was taken in the office of the Crown Solicitor for a period of 6 weeks after instructions were received.  The explanation (such as it was) for that delay was that ""this was a very busy period in the office and the office was closed for Christmas..."".  The fundamental inadequacy of that explanation needs no further comment.   It must (or at least it should) have been apparent to the relevant person(s) within the Crown Solicitors office that the advice sought could not be provided until such time as there had been a response to the orders issued pursuant to s. 25.  It must have been equally apparent that the recipients of such orders would require some time to respond.  All of these matters, as well as the defendant's impending release, highlighted the need to give the matter priority and deal with it urgently.  Allowing a period of almost 6 weeks to elapse without a single step being taken is, in my view, wholly unacceptable.  It is also at odds with the expectation that the Crown will act as a model litigant.  
14Thirdly, and even though the order relating to the service of material upon the defendant was made with the plaintiff's consent, the plaintiff apparently did not comply with it.  As a result, the defendant was served with the relevant documentation only a matter of days before the preliminary hearing was to come before the Court.  The fact that he was in custody in a facility which was a considerable distance from Sydney simply compounded the difficulties which already existed.  
15All of these circumstances combined to place the defendant in a position which was both invidious and unfair, and gave rise to two particular consequences.  Firstly, the various delays to which I have referred resulted in the preliminary hearing coming before the court only 48 hours prior to the defendant's scheduled release from custody, necessitating the making of a decision virtually immediately.  That created a number of difficulties with the court's administration, not the least of which was ensuring the availability of a Judge to hear the application.    
16Secondly, the defendant was placed in a position in which he had, to say the least, a limited opportunity to consult with his lawyers.  I regard the position in which he was placed as one which bordered on being procedurally unfair.    
17Tardiness of the degree which has been exhibited by the plaintiff in the present case is unacceptable.  This is particularly so when the issue which is being litigated bears upon a person's liberty.  As a matter of common sense, the release date of any offender to whom the provisions of the Act might apply is obviously known, or can at least be readily ascertained, well in advance.  In my view, there is no reason why, in a case which is identified as being one to which the Act might apply, instructions cannot be given by the Attorney-General's Department to the Crown Solicitor far earlier than they were in the present case. Moreover, it is imperative that those lawyers within the office of the Crown Solicitor who are responsible for the supervision and carriage of applications under the Act deal with them far more expeditiously than they did in the present case.  It is to be hoped that future applications under the Act will not exhibit similar tardiness in preparation.
18I should perhaps make it clear that none of the observations I have made should be regarded, in any way, as a reflection upon counsel who appeared on behalf of the plaintiff.  On the contrary, had it not been for the diligence and assistance of both counsel, the resolution of the matter would have been rendered even more difficult.  The comprehensive written submissions provided by both counsel have been of considerable assistance in determining the issues.
BACKGROUND19I have already noted the sentence imposed by Mathews J and her Honour's sentencing remarks are in evidence before me.  Whilst I do not propose to recount the entirety of those remarks, it is necessary for me to outline the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence of which the defendant was found guilty.
20In February 1990 the defendant lived with his parents on a property known as ""Pleasant View"" at The Rock.  That property adjoined a property known as ""Timbarra"" at which Mrs Glanville lived with her husband and family.  The defendant had not met Mrs Glanville prior to her death, although he had met her husband on two or three occasions when discussing a problem of straying sheep. 
21On the morning of 27 February 1990 the defendant watched a movie entitled ""Nightmare at Shadow Woods"", which was described by her Honour as ""an unpleasant, violent film in which the major character was a psychopath who roamed the area with a large knife killing a number of people in extremely ghoulish circumstances"".  The defendant then took a knife and walked across to Mrs Glanville's home, where he spoke with her at the front door about straying sheep.  Although he left the premises the defendant did not actually return home, but waited outside Mrs Glanville's property.  Five minutes later he removed a fly screen from a bedroom window and climbed into the premises.  He encountered Mrs Glanville in a hallway.  She ran towards the kitchen in an unsuccessful attempt to reach the telephone.  The defendant killed her by repeatedly stabbing her.  
22The defendant initially denied any involvement in Mrs Glanville's murder when spoken to by police.  However, he later made a number of admissions.  The defence raised at trial, and which was ultimately rejected by the jury, was one of diminished responsibility.  
23The principal evidence in the defendant's case at trial was given by his father, along with a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore.  The evidence of the defendant's father, which was described by her Honour as ""lengthy and compelling"", recounted the defendant, as a 7 year old, being prone to violent outbursts, often lasting some hours.  The defendant's parents sought medical assistance.  A psychiatrist found no sign of mental illness and a neurologist found no evidence of organic damage.  A CAT scan and an EEG were both reported as normal.
24The defendant's family was then referred to an organisation associated with Westmead Hospital known as Redbank House, where an assessment was made that the defendant's problems were behavioural and did not reflect any underlying psychiatric or organic illness.  It was concluded that his outbursts were manipulative in nature.  The family received counselling, along with education in techniques for physically restraining the defendant in the case of an outburst.
25Her Honour found that for a period of time after this assessment, the defendant's behaviour improved.  However, a subsequent EEG demonstrated epileptiform features.  
26Dr Westmore gave evidence that in his opinion the defendant was suffering from an underlying organic condition consisting of an electrical disturbance in the brain.  He expressed the view that the abnormal EEG supported that diagnosis and that the disturbance was likely to be triggered if the defendant became emotionally aroused, at which time he would lose all control over his actions but would be subsequently amnesic as to any events which had occurred during the episode.
27Dr Milton, psychiatrist, gave evidence for the Crown at trial.  He disputed Dr Westmore's diagnosis, although he did agree that it was not inconsistent with the defendant's history.  Dr Milton's opinion was that the defendant had no organic or psychiatric illness and that his problems were caused by feelings of inferiority, combined with fantasies of violence. He expressed the opinion that the defendant resorted to killing Mrs Glanville because it gave him a sense of power and that he enjoyed it because through violence, he was able to overcome feelings of inferiority.
28In circumstances where there was other evidence which supported Dr Milton's assessment her Honour thought that the jury's verdict was unsurprising.  That said, her Honour found that the defendant was significantly more disturbed than Dr Milton's assessment tended to indicate.  Whilst not so disturbed so as to reduce his culpability from murder to manslaughter pursuant to the provisions of s. 23A of the Crimes Act 1900, her Honour concluded that evidence given at the trial clearly indicated that the defendant was a ""very disturbed young man, both before and after he committed this offence"".  She found that there were special circumstances within the meaning of the relevant legislation as it then stood which justified an adjustment being made in terms of the proportion to the minimum term to the overall sentence.  However, as I have outlined below, the defendant repeatedly expressed a desire not to be released on parole, but to serve the entirety of his sentence.


THE RELEVANT LEGISLATION29The summons seeks orders that the defendant be subject to: 
(i)a continuing detention order; or alternatively
(ii)an extended supervision order.
30In her written submissions, counsel for the plaintiff took me to the various statutory provisions.  The necessity to set out the entirety of those provisions has been alleviated by the fact that counsel for the defendant did not take issue with the fact that the defendant fell within those provisions, and did not dispute that it was open to the plaintiff to make the present application.  
31In short, although the defendant opposed the making of a continuing detention order, he did not oppose the court appointing two Psychiatrists for the purposes of examining the defendant and furnishing reports to the Court and similarly did not oppose the making of an extended supervision order.  Counsel for the defendant submitted that adequate supervision would be provided by the making of such an order, and that such supervision would adequately address the relevant risk.
THE EVIDENCE32Two large volumes of documentary material have been placed before the court in support of the plaintiff's application.  Whilst I do not propose to canvass the entirety of that material, the following matters are relevant.  
33Firstly, but for two days the defendant has served the entirety of the 24 year sentence imposed by Mathews J.  That sentence has been served, in large measure, in protection.  
34Secondly, although his non-parole period expired some 9 years ago, the defendant has not sought parole at any time.  On the contrary, he has consistently stated that he wished to serve the entirety of the sentence imposed.  He has done so notwithstanding reports from the Offenders Review Council as far back as 2011 in which release on parole was recommended on the basis that his custodial reports were good, family support was strong and employment was available, such that it was considered that supervised conditional liberty was both available and appropriate.    
35Thirdly, the defendant has undertaken what have been described as ""short based therapeutic programs"" whilst in custody.  These have included programs directed towards relapse prevention, anger management, alcohol and drug awareness, and reintegration into the community.  The evidence before me makes specific reference to the fact that the defendant demonstrated a high level of participation and engagement in those programs.  Although the defendant has not undertaken the Violent Offenders Treatment Program, this came about because he was fearful that if he did so, he might lose his protected status.  He did express a willingness to move to another facility where the course could be undertaken whilst he remained on protection but this request apparently could not be met.  It might also be noted that it was ultimately determined that the defendant was unsuitable for the Violent Offenders Treatment Program in any event because his complex personality factors were beyond the scope of the program.  In this regard it is of some significance that the defendant expressed a continued willingness to engage in psychological treatment.  
36Fourthly, the defendant has participated in periods of day leave, as well as periods of supervised work release.  No adverse reports have been received in respect of any of these periods of leave.
37Fifthly, although the defendant had originally expressed a desire to return to his family property, his mother and sister have now moved to the outskirts of Sydney where it is proposed that the defendant would reside if released.  Returning to the family property, which as I have noted is remote and located adjacent to that previously occupied by Mrs Glanville, would not have been satisfactory for a variety of reasons, not the least of which would have been the practical difficulties in implementing close supervision.  However, those issues have now been overcome.
38Finally, the conditions which would attach to any extended supervision order are necessarily strict.  In this regard, a report of Megan Donaldson, Forensic Psychologist, dated 25 February 2014 notes the following (at [100]):
""In the event that Mr Phillips is subject to an Extended Supervision Order, it is likely that he would be subject to ongoing intensive supervision and case management by the CSNSW. Under such supervision, Mr Phillips would be encouraged to reside in one location, with little scope for spontaneous travel. His social contacts would be scrutinised, with the aim of increasing pro-social influences. He would be subject to unannounced home visits and breath-analysis/urinalysis. He may be obliged to wear electronic monitoring equipment or to provide a schedule of his daily activities. He may be referred to a community based treatment program; however, I am unaware of any community-based violent offender program currently operating that would be considered sufficiently intensive to meet his treatment needs. Successful management would involve containment of those behaviours associated with risk (such as impulsivity, emotional dysregulation, and cognitive distortions). The goal would be to encourage the development and maintenance of a stable and sustainable lifestyle, so that new habits can be formed that might endure beyond supervision. Such supervision could minimise risk of behaviour that may otherwise result in a violent offending scenario. Conversely, effective supervision may also contribute to lowering risk by encouraging Mr Phillips to develop a way of living that is inconsistent with violent offending, with stable pro-social relationships, satisfying employment and healthy recreation"".

THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES  39Counsel for the plaintiff advanced, in broad terms, four matters in support of the submission that I should make an interim detention order pending a final hearing at which the Court would, amongst other things, have the benefit of psychiatric evidence.  Those four matters were:
(i)the defendant's criminal history;(ii)the assessed risk;(iii)the defendant's failure to undertake treatment whilst in custody; and(iv)the uncertain accommodation arrangements which were originally proposed.
40Counsel submitted that if I were not persuaded to make an interim detention order, an interim supervision order imposing the conditions to which I have referred should be made.  
41Counsel for the defendant submitted that in circumstances where a rigorous regime of supervisory conditions was proposed, there was nothing exceptional about the risk posed by the defendant which would cause me to conclude that adequate supervision would not be provided by an interim supervision order.  He did raise issues about the terms of some of the proposed conditions but it is not necessary for me to deal with those matters.  It is sufficient for present purposes to note that in my view, the terms of the proposed conditions are, in the main, appropriate.
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION42One of the obvious considerations in a matter such as the present is that of risk avoidance (see Attorney General v Winters [2007] NSWSC 311 at [7]).  However, if I am satisfied that appropriate measures can be put in place to address any risk which might exist, it is open to me to make an extended supervision order (see generally State of New South Wales v Irwin [2013] NSWSC 1773; State of New South Wales v Atkins [2013] NSWSC 1988).  
43At the present time, if the making of such an order were otherwise thought to be appropriate, it would be made on an interim basis only.  The relevant question in those circumstances is whether, during that interim period, the arrangements which are able to be put in place would adequately address the risk of the defendant re-offending (see State of New South Wales v Irwin (supra) at [11]).  In Tillman v The Attorney General for the State of New South Wales [2007] NSWCA 327 Mason P said at [6]:
""If the Court perceives itself able to devise a regime of extended supervision that will make it unlikely that the particular offender will relevantly re-offend, then the combined effect of subsections (2) and (3) is that the lesser control is to be chosen. But if re-offending remains likely despite an extended supervision order, then the power to impose the more stringent control of a continuing detention order is engaged.""
44On the evidence before me, and having regard to the proposed conditions which, if implemented, would establish a strict regime of supervision, I am satisfied that an extended supervision order is appropriate.  I have come to that view for a number of reasons.
45Firstly, although the defendant obviously has a criminal history, it is limited to the offence for which he is currently in custody.  He has not committed any further criminal offences and although there is some evidence of disciplinary issues whilst in custody, I am satisfied on the evidence that for the last several years there has been virtually no aspect of his behaviour which has given rise to specific cause for concern.  In particular, there have been no recent instances of violent behaviour.  Perhaps even more importantly, the periods in which he has been absent on short term release have not met with any adverse reports, be it in relation to his ability to interact with others, or in relation to his behaviour generally.    
46Secondly, whilst there has been some failure on the part of the defendant to undertake treatment whilst in custody, that failure has been largely limited to a failure to undertake the Violent Offenders Treatment Program.  The reasons for that failure have, in my view, been adequately explained.  This is certainly not a case in which the defendant has refused to undertake treatment.  On the contrary, he has satisfactorily completed a number of courses and has expressed a willingness to engage in psychological treatment to assist his rehabilitation.  
47Thirdly, the plaintiff's justifiable concern at the prospect of the defendant returning to live at his family property has now been alleviated by his mother's decision to move to Sydney.  
48Finally, the conditions which will attach to the order that I propose, the nature of which are outlined by Ms Donaldson, will necessarily be strict.  I am satisfied that those conditions constitute a regime which supports the implementation of the ""lesser control"" to which Mason P referred in Tillman (supra).  
ORDERS49For the forgoing reasons, I made the following orders at the conclusion of the hearing before me on 7 March 2014:  
(1)Pursuant to section 15(4) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (""the Act""):

2705445,R v Panetta [2014] NSWSC 27,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE
1On 14 November 2013 the Defendant pleaded guilty to murdering Muhammed Shafique on 18 September 2008.  He had been due to stand trial on 18 November 2013.
2This is one of those unusual cases where the offender's commission of the offence was not suspected until a disclosure by him.  The deceased's death and the offender's involvement in it only came to light when he attended Dee Why Police Station on 12 November 2010 and informed the police that he wanted to confess to the murder.  
Background facts
3The following facts concerning the offence and the offender's admissions are taken from a Statement of Agreed Facts.
4In 1987, the deceased, Muhammed Shafique, married Sharon Shafique. In 1989, they had their first child and in 1997 their second child was born.
5In 2004, Muhammed Shafique and Sharon Shafique separated. Muhammed Shafique moved out from their residence and into a unit in Herbert Street, West Ryde NSW where he resided alone. Sharon and the two children remained at the family residence.  The children subsequently lived with the deceased.
6In 2007, Muhammed Shafique and Sharon Shafique were formally divorced.
7In late 2007, Sharon Shafique commenced an intimate relationship with the offender, Adam Panetta. Sharon introduced her two children to the offender as her younger brother and sister.   The offender believed Sharon was 19 years old when she was in fact 39 or 40 years old.  Sharon told the children not to tell the offender that she was their mother and that they had to refer to her by the name 'Nadia' when they were in the presence of the offender.
The offender's admissions
8At the Dee Why Police Station on 12 November 2010 the offender was arrested and placed into custody.  He was provided the opportunity to contact a solicitor but declined.  He was then cautioned and voluntarily took part in a recorded interview with police where he made the following admissions.
9During late 2007 or early 2008, he commenced a relationship with a woman known to him as 'Nadia' who resided at 11/1-3 Linsley Street, Gladesville NSW. During the course of the relationship, 'Nadia' gave him certain information about the deceased, claiming that he was a bad person associated with the Taliban, and was involved in fraud and criminal activity. The offender said that 'Nadia' claimed that the Police had not been able to find any evidence against the deceased. The offender said that he then set about following the deceased in an attempt to gather evidence against him to give to the Police.
10He purchased an electronic tracking device in early June 2008, which he attached to the deceased's vehicle. He was able to track the position and movement of the vehicle via the tracking device using his computer.
11On 18 September 2008, as a result of information obtained from following the deceased and as a consequence of the computer information from the tracking device, the offender drove his vehicle, a white Mitsubishi van, to the underground car park of a residential unit block at 22-26 Herbert Street, West Ryde NSW.  He then waited for the deceased to arrive. He was aware the deceased had a ""business office"" in that unit block.
12Between 2.00pm and 3.00pm that afternoon the deceased drove his vehicle into the car park, parked alongside the offender's vehicle and got out of the car.
13At that time the offender intended to abduct and rob the deceased. He had cable ties with him to be utilised during the offence. He grabbed the deceased and attempted to put him into the rear of his van. He told police:
Q32  I don't know if I was tricked or I'm not sure. Um, I got told this person who was dealing with illegal, bringing people into the country and was a bad person and all this and I sort of took advantage of the situation and I, I, my anger got the better of me and um, I took care of this person...'
Q33  ....the police wanted evidence to arrest this man.
Q34  ....so I was trying to get evidence but I took it too far and didn't go the way of the plan and I killed him.
Q113  She said there's this bad person bringing illegal people from overseas and myself being a gambler I thought he had money so I went to follow him for the reason that she wanted to get him into trouble with the police but the police didn't have enough evidence on him because he was too tricky, too many different identities so I tried to get evidence, it didn't quite work out that way and got myself in a big problem now. 
Q 35   '... Well I was trying to tie him up in my van but he reached and got my hammer out of my van, struck me in the head once so I took the hammer off him and repeatedly hit him in the head...'
Q 161 (I followed him that day)(t)o try and catch him getting fraudulent mail from the post office which he had multiple keys to post office boxes.
Q249  '... I tried to tie him up. There was a hammer there which I use for work, he grabbed it, struck me in the head with it.
Q252 '...As a soon as that happened I grabbed the hammer off him and I repeatedly hit him in the head...' 
Q 253 '...Probably about fifteen times...'
Q 256 'I just went into a rage.
Q 585 Well it was drummed into my head that this guy's got to go down, he's in they've got to get him in trouble with the cops because of what he's doing so I thought it would be a good idea.
Q 601 I was meant to do one thing but it led to another.
14He then picked up the body of the deceased and placed it into the back of his van. He took a fire hose from the car park and washed down blood from the ground where the attack took place. He then took a briefcase from the deceased's vehicle before leaving the area in his Mitsubishi van.
15He panicked and then drove his van with the body of the deceased to a location near Campbelltown where he waited until dark before removing the body and burying it in bush land. He disposed of the deceased's briefcase and contents and also stole $1,400.00 cash from the deceased's wallet, before discarding the wallet. He then burnt the documents contained in the briefcase. He smashed the deceased's mobile phone at Campbelltown and disposed of it in a rubbish bin before he buried the deceased because he was worried about the phone being traced.  
16At the time of the offence the offender said he had alcohol in his system having had two cans of Johnnie Walker and Coke.
17The offender told investigating police that he had broken up with 'Nadia' in the months following this incident but still remained in frequent contact with her.
18The offender told police that he had come forward due to the overwhelming stress and anxiety that the matter had caused him.  He told Police, ""I couldn't live with this anymore"".   When speaking with police and being interviewed the offender appeared to be highly distressed.
19The police investigated the admissions made by the offender.
Location of the deceased
20On 17 November 2010, the offender directed investigators to the place where he said he had buried the deceased on Swaffham Road, Minto NSW. The area was excavated and skeletal remains were located. The skeletal remains were face down and the hands were cable-tied to the rear. 
21These remains have been identified from dental records as being the deceased.
Injuries to the deceased
22Dr Issabella Brouwer, forensic pathologist, conducted an autopsy report on the deceased's remains.  Due to the decomposition of the body the cause of death was unable to be determined.  According to the autopsy report two large fractures were located on the right side of the head consistent with the offender's admissions.  The number of blows to the deceased's head could not be accurately determined. 
Movements of the deceased's car
23Some objective evidence uncovered by investigating police in relation to movements of the deceased's car on 18 September 2008 cannot be precisely reconciled with some details of the offender's admissions as to the timing of the killing of the deceased and the disposal of his body. However, it is possible, due to the lapse of time and the offender's distressed state when being interviewed, that some details of the admissions are not completely reliable.
24Analysis of the tracking device the offender placed on the deceased's vehicle shows that the vehicle drove to West Ryde at 1.49pm on 18 September and remained there until shortly before 3 am on 19 September 2008.  The vehicle then travelled to the Campbelltown area where it remained until the last recorded transmission of the device at 3.27pm that day. At 4.30pm that day the deceased's vehicle was photographed travelling north on the Eastern Distributor at Woolloomooloo. 
25The deceased's vehicle has not been recovered.
Alleged criminal activities of the deceased
26Police confirmed that the deceased's wife had previously claimed that the deceased was involved in criminal activities. On 24 January 2007 Sharon Shafique provided information to the Australian Federal Police alleging that the deceased was involved in fraud and possible terrorist activities.
27Subsequent to the deceased's murder, on 24 October 2008 the NSW Police Fraud Control and Investigations ""dob in line"" received a call from a female describing herself as ""Claudia"" suggesting that the deceased was a member of the Taliban and was involved in people smuggling. The information was consistent with that previously provided by the deceased's wife and is believed to have been provided by her. 
28Police investigations have not found support for the recorded claims made by the deceased's wife.
Importance of the offender's disclosure
29Prior to the offender handing himself in to police there was no suspicion held by police that the deceased's disappearance was suspicious or that he had been murdered.  The offender was not a suspect in any way in relation to the disappearance of the deceased.
30In the absence of the offender's admissions to police there was no prospect of the deceased's murder coming to light nor of the offender's involvement in it.   
31In the absence of the offender leading police to the burial site of the deceased's body there was no prospect of the deceased's body being located.
Subjective features
32The offender was born on 27 November 1978 and is now aged 35 years.  He is one of four sons of Italian parents.  He has two older brothers and a non-identical twin brother.  He was living at home with his parents until his incarceration.  He told Ms Anita Duffy, who assessed him in August 2012, that his parents were ""very excitable and negative people"".  He could recall fights and arguments between them since he was young.  He was not physically abused by them but he continually felt on edge by the fighting.  In addition his father would often scream at him.
33He completed Year 10 and left school at the age of 16.  He then worked in a factory and later in a fruit market.  He has also worked as a builders' labourer before becoming self employed as a handyman.  He has always been employed since leaving school.
34He told Dr Stephen Allnutt, Dr Wayne Reid and Dr Susan Pulman that he had been taking smoking marijuana and using amphetamines since either 14 or 16.  However, he told Ms Duffy, that he had never used illicit drugs.
35He told all of the professionals who examined him that he started drinking at about 14 or 16 and would often drink to intoxication.  He told Ms Duffy that he began gambling when he was about 16 but did not mention this to the others who examined him.  It is consistent with what he told the police.
36The relationship he had with Sharon Shafique was his first serious relationship.  He was with her for two to three years and lived with her for about 12 months.  
37When Ms Duffy assessed the offender she administered a number of tests.  The offender's assessment on the Weschler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence placed him in the Low Average range at 85.  Ms Duffy said that his scores in the Vocabulary and the Similarities subtests indicated relatively limited word knowledge, verbal expression and a tendency to think in rather concrete terms.
38Ms Duffy administered the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory III.  This is a comprehensive personality questionnaire comprising the measure of basic personality characteristics, more severe personality pathology as well as a number of clinical symptoms more transient and reactive to current circumstances.
39Across the basic personality scales the offender revealed a strong Depressive feature as well as Dependent, Passive/Aggressive and Self-Defeating traits.   Ms Duffy said:
Mr Panetta's profile indicates an enduring pattern of thoughts, attitudes, behaviours and self-concepts related to depression. He may perceive himself as worthless, vulnerable, inadequate, unsuccessful and guilty and may frequently engage in self-criticism. He tends to view events in his life in a defeatist or fatalistic manner, expecting the worst. The Negativistic or Passive/Aggressive elevation flavours his depression with some resentment. He may vacillate between being bitter and resentful towards others versus being intropunitive and self-deprecatory.
The Dependent elevation indicates a strong need for affection and support by others, and therefore, to gain approval, [he] tends to be submissive and conciliatory rather than assertive or argumentative. He looks to others to lead and care for him and in this way gives up responsibility for making decisions. Underlying his insecurity are feelings of low self-esteem. In his eagerness for acceptance and approval, he can be extremely agreeable and submissive, subjugating his own needs to those of others. He may be perceived as gullible, humble, docile and passive, and therefore more vulnerable to manipulation or domination by others. Internally, he may have a limited range of competencies in reducing tension and stressors.
40Ms Duffy said that on scales measuring more serious clinical symptomatology the offender's results lay just below significance on measures of Thought Disorder and Major Depression.
41Dr Stephen Allnutt examined the offender on 19 April 2013.  In his report of 24 April 2013 he noted that at the time the Defendant had confessed to the police he was demonstrating significant symptoms of depression.  Dr Allnutt said that the symptoms were characterised by
poor sleep, reduced appetite, reduced energy levels, reduced motivation, impaired concentration, loss of interest in usual activities, anhedonia;  these symptoms had occurred in the wake of the index injury and according to him as a consequence of unresolved feelings of guilt in regard to his behaviour at the material time.
42By the time Dr Allnutt examined him the offender had experienced an amelioration of those symptoms but was manifesting residual symptoms of a resolving depressive disorder.  He was taking the anti-depressant Zoloft on a daily basis.  He was also continuing to experience mild panic attacks that had their onset at the time of his incarceration.  
43The offender was assessed by Dr Susan Pulman, a clinical neuro-psychologist and forensic psychologist, on 16 and 28 October 2013.  Dr Pulman administered a number of tests to the offender.
44That testing showed that his pre-morbid intellectual functioning was estimated to fall within the low average to average range.  His current intellectual functioning fell within the low average range and at the fourth percentile.  His General Ability Index fell in the low average range at the tenth percentile.  There was some variability in the sub-test scores with his performance varying from Borderline on the task of non-verbal conceptual reasoning to Superior in the task of immediate attention span.  
45Dr Pulman administered the self report Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21).  The offender's scores on each of those scales were in the Extremely Severe range.  However, she said that those scores were inconsistent with his presentation during interview.  She did not find, having administered the Test of Memory Malingering, that he was not endeavouring to do his best in the tests administered, unlike Dr Reid who found that the scores achieved by the offender when he had administered that test showed that he was not performing to the best of his ability.  The scores in that test raised concerns about the reliability of the scores in the memory tests.  
46In his assessment of the offender on 16 October 2013 Dr Reid found that the offender scored in the extremely low range for non-verbal intellectual functions (63) placing him at the first percentile for persons of a similar age.  Dr Reid also noted that the offender presented with depressed mood, was slow in his responses, his affect was flat and he offered little in the way of spontaneous speech.  Dr Reid thought, from the history he had obtained both from the offender and from reading earlier reports, that the offender appeared to have longstanding problems with attention, low self esteem and a past history of drug and alcohol abuse.  Dr Reid was of the opinion that his level of depression was having a significant impact on his cognitive abilities.
47Some care must be taken in relation to all of the reports because, with the exception of the assessment by Ms Duffy, those reports were prepared after assessments designed to see whether the offender was fit to stand trial.  Nevertheless, in general terms, they disclose a fairly similar picture of the offender being of low-average intelligence, with personality problems related to self-esteem, drug and alcohol issues, and suffering from depression.  
48Ms Duffy noted that the offender expressed remorse and regret over his actions which she said appeared to have arisen from a series of errors in his judgment fuelled by misinformation from the woman Nadia.  Although the offender did not give evidence before me, and I note the care that needs to be taken in such circumstances in accepting expressions of remorse given to psychologists and psychiatrists, the expressions of remorse to Ms Duffy are entirely consistent with all that has happened in the matter since the offender confessed to his crime.  I refer again also to what Dr Allnutt reported that I have set out above.  My observations of him during the sentencing hearing served to confirm that he was extremely remorseful for what he had done.
49The offender has a minor criminal history involving some property and driving offences.  Some of these were committed whilst he was a minor and the last offences were in 2000.  The Crown concedes that these do not disentitle him from being considered as a person of prior good character.  
Objective seriousness
50The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment.  There is a standard non-parole period relevant to the present case of 20 years.  Both matters are guideposts.
51The Crown submitted that the Court could conclude that the intention at the time of striking the blows was to kill the victim and that the intent arose when the victim resisted the offender.  
52The offender's counsel submitted that there was no planning by the offender in relation to the murder and no premeditation.  He submitted that the answers given in the offender's record of interview show that he neither intended to kill nor inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased.  Rather it was submitted that the offender's state of mind was reckless indifference with the result that the murder was in the lowest category for the offence: Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 at [49].  
53In my opinion the Agreed Statement of Facts indicate that the offender did not set out with the intention of killing the deceased.  The intention was to abduct and rob the deceased.  It was whilst the offender was trying to restrain the deceased that the deceased obtained a hammer and struck the offender.  At that point the offender grabbed the hammer and hit the deceased repeatedly in the head perhaps about 15 times.  I note again that the autopsy showed two large fractures consistent with the offender's admissions.
54A person who uses a hammer to strike another person in the head with any force, even just with one blow, must have intended to cause grievous bodily harm to that person.  To strike them on and around the head a number of times with a hammer evinces a clear intention to commit grievous bodily harm.  I cannot be satisfied, however, beyond reasonable doubt that, even at that point, the offender intended to kill the deceased.   Rather, he was trying to subdue him to further his purpose of abducting and robbing him.
55However, the striking of the deceased with the hammer took place in the context of an attempt by the offender to commit a serious crime.  It was not simply an excessive application of force in self-defence in an unprovoked attack by the deceased where it might be inferred that there was no intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.
56The offender submitted that I could take into account, when assessing objective seriousness, his low intelligence and his gullible personality because they are relevant to the actual offending.  I do not consider that such a submission is consistent with what was said in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [27].  Nothing said subsequently by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Muldrock [2012] NSWCCA 108 at [8(b)] provides any support for the offender's submission in this regard.  The matters identified by the offender are relevant to his moral culpability and not to the objective gravity of the crime: see R v Lawson Donald [2013] NSWCCA 238 at [82].  
57Despite the savagery of the assault on the deceased, it arose spontaneously without planning or pre-meditation.  In all the circumstances I consider the offence falls a little below the mid range of objective seriousness.
The plea
58As noted earlier the offender's plea of guilty came on the second business day before the trial was due to begin.  He had been committed to this Court for sentence only on 12 March 2012.  The matter was adjourned a number of times until 7 September 2012 where the offender indicated that the charge was to be defended.  Some of the delay in that period related to issues with Legal Aid and the offender's legal representation.
59On 7 September 2012 the matter was set down for trial on 2 April 2013.  It was only on 15 March 2013 that the legal representative of the offender indicated that fitness to plead and diminished responsibility might be the issue.  That resulted in an application on 20 March 2013 to vacate the trial date so that the offender could be submitted to psychiatric assessment in relation to the possibility of diminished responsibility.  The trial date was vacated.  
60Reports were then obtained from Dr Westmore on behalf of the offender and Dr Allnutt on behalf of the Crown, both of whom were of the opinion that the offender was fit to stand trial.  As a consequence of those reports, on 14 May 2013 a new trial date was fixed of 18 November 2013.  It was not until 28 October 2013 that the offender obtained a report from Dr Wayne Reid who did not provide any support for a defence of diminished responsibility.  The Crown obtained a report from Dr Susan Pulman on 7 November 2013.  She also did not consider that the offender had sustained any significant brain injury in a motor vehicle accident in which the offender had been involved in 2000 that was thought to provide the basis for a defence of diminished responsibility.
61It may be accepted that some of the delays from March 2012 to 14 November 2013 were occasioned by the difficulties in obtaining medical reports.  However, the primary consideration for determining the appropriate discount for a plea is the timing of the plea: R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [160].  In my opinion the appropriate discount for the plea is ten per cent.
The Ellis discount
62It is also necessary to give consideration to the events that led to the disclosure of this murder and the offender's role in it.  If it had not been for the voluntary disclosure of the offender no one but the offender would have known that the deceased had been murdered.  Further, no one would have known that the offender was responsible for the deceased's death.  Finally, the whereabouts of the deceased's remains would not have been known.  Leniency, even considerable leniency, should be extended to the offender for those matters:  R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603 at 604.
63The voluntary disclosure by the offender brought an end to uncertainty for the deceased's family and enabled some resolution of their grief.  I note in this regard the Victim's Impact Statement of the deceased's daughter Maliha Shafique, but I bear in mind what was said in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 86-87 with respect to that Statement.  The Court again extends its sympathy to Ms Shafique and the other members of the deceased's family.  
64In Ellis Street CJ said at (604):
Where it was unlikely that guilt would be discovered and established were it not for the disclosure by the person coming forward for sentence, then a considerable element of leniency should properly be extended by the sentencing judge. It is part of the policy of the criminal law to encourage a guilty person to come forward and disclose both the fact of an offence having been committed and confession of guilt of that offence.
65There is some disagreement in the authorities about whether the precise discount given should be specified.  In Raad v R [2011] NSWCCA 138 Adams J said at [51]:
There is much to be said for adopting in Ellis cases the approach used for pleas of guilty and in the other assistance cases, namely to specify the utilitarian discount given, not only in the interests of transparency, but to further the policy objective of the discount. 
66Although Buddin J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL agreed) did not make specific reference to these remarks of Adams J, Buddin J's reference at [83] to Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2006) 228 CLR 357 at [37] about the difficulties to which ""an arithmetical approach"" to sentencing may give rise suggests that he did not agree with the approach of specifying a particular discount.
67Adams J's approach was endorsed by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the Northern Territory in Nona v The Queen [2012] NTCCA 03 at [36] after discussion of the cases supporting one or other approach to the issue.
68In R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 at [32] Howie J said there should be no separate quantified discount in respect of Ellis.  Similarly, in R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 Basten JA (with whom Price and SG Campbell JJ agreed on this aspect) made reference to Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; (2001) 206 CLR 267 at [15] to suggest that it was not appropriate to give any numerical indication as to the degree of leniency which should be accorded.  
69Recently, in Barbaro v The Queen; Zirilli v The Queen [2014] HCA 2 the plurality judgment said at [34]:
... Sentencing an offender is not, and cannot be undertaken as, some exercise in addition or subtraction. A sentencing judge must reach a single sentence for each offence and must do so by balancing many different and conflicting features. The sentence cannot, and should not, be broken down into some set of component parts. As the plurality said in Wong v The Queen, ""[s]o long as a sentencing judge must, or may, take account of all of the circumstances of the offence and the offender, to single out some of those considerations and attribute specific numerical or proportionate value to some features, distorts the already difficult balancing exercise which the judge must perform"" (original emphasis).
70I consider, therefore, with all due respect to Adams J, that the weight of authority suggests that any Ellis discount should not be specified .
The sentence
71The starting point is that the death of a human being by any unlawful killing is one of the gravest offences against an ordered society:  R v Bolt [2001] NSWCCA 487; (2001) 126 A Crim R 284 at 293.  It is the responsibility of the Courts to protect and preserve human life and to punish those who unlawfully take it:  R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363 at [31].  
72The present is a very unusual case.  The actions that led up to the murder were unlikely to have occurred had it not been for the low intelligence and personality problems suffered by the offender.  He was obviously a vulnerable and suggestible person.  The woman who provided the false information to him concerning the deceased was his first and only serious relationship.  It appears that in addition to his gullibility he was endeavouring to please her, bearing in mind that he had no prior knowledge of the deceased.  
73That does not mean, however, that general deterrence is not of any significance in the present matter.  The offender took the law into his own hands because he had come to believe that the police had not done, or were not willing to do, what the offender believed they ought to have done to bring the deceased to justice.  In fact when the police investigated they found nothing to support the allegations.  That highlights one of the dangers of persons taking the law into their own hands.  They are likely to have inadequate or one-sided information or even, as here, entirely false information.
74Further, it needs to be acknowledged that the murder was a brutal one although, until the offender's plan went wrong in the sense that the deceased managed to grab a hammer and attack the offender, the most harm that was intended to the deceased was that he should be abducted and robbed.  Nevertheless, the deceased was an entirely innocent man who had become the victim of his ex-wife's obsession or vindictiveness or both, and the stupidity and criminality of the offender.  
75I have already made reference to certain mitigating factors being that the offender may be regarded as of prior good character and that the remorse he has shown is genuine.  I consider that he has good prospects of rehabilitation.
76Counsel for the offender submitted that there should be a finding of special circumstances.  He pointed to the following matters.  First, it would be the offender's first time in full time custody.  Secondly, his assistance in coming forward and admitting the offence as well as taking the police to the place of burial should be recognised.  Thirdly, the offender will require an extended period of supervision when returned to live in the community.  
77I do not consider that there are special circumstances.  The fact that it will be an offender's first time in custody will not, without anything more, justify a finding of special circumstances.  The majority in Raad did not consider that an Ellis discount justified a finding of special circumstances.  Further, nothing in the psychological and psychiatric reports suggests that the offender will need an extended period under supervision in the community for rehabilitation.  I do not consider there is a great risk that the offender will ever re-offend.  The matters which brought about his offending in the present case are so unusual that I do not consider, even having regard to his vulnerable personality, that he is likely to re-offend or will need more than the usual period on parole.    
78The most significant matter affecting the sentence is the discount for the principle derived from Ellis.  It should be noted that the offender's disclosure to the police informs the assessment of his remorse and contrition whilst reducing, potentially to insignificance, the requirement for personal deterrence:  Raad at [20].
79There are not a lot of cases where the Ellis principle has been applied in relation to a charge of murder.  I have had regard to such cases as there are (those referred to in Raad as well as Nona), but I bear in mind that all of these cases pre-date the introduction of the standard non-parole period.  The sentences in those cases are not, therefore, of much assistance in this case.
80The offender is entitled to considerable leniency for his reporting of the murder including his involvement and for providing the location of the deceased's body.  Taking that and all other matters into consideration and with a ten per cent discount for the plea I consider that the appropriate overall sentence is a period of 17 years with a non-parole period of 12 years and 9 months. 
81The offender has been in custody since 12 November 2010 and the sentence should be backdated to start on that day.
82Adam Panneta, for the crime of murdering Muhammed Shafique on 18 September 2008, I sentence you to a non-parole period of 12 years and nine months commencing 12 November 2010 and expiring 11 August 2023 with an additional term of 4 years and 3 months expiring 11 November 2027.  The first day that you will be eligible for parole is 12 August 2023.

2705448,Nguyen v R [2014] NSWCCA 16,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Schmidt J and the orders which she proposes.

2In relation to the application for leave to appeal against sentence, there was no ""Muldrock error"" in his Honour's approach. On the contrary, his reference to the maximum penalty, the standard non-parole period and the objective seriousness of the offence was fully consistent with the guidance provided by Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

3SCHMIDT J: On 19 May 2011, a jury convicted the appellant of being knowingly concerned in the supply of not less than a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug cocaine (s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW)). He appeals his conviction and also seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed by Taylor DCJ on 4 October 2011.

4The appellant was convicted after a trial at which the issue was whether he was a participant in the supply of the cocaine, or an innocent agent utilised by his co-accused Ho Thien Chuong Pham, not having the knowledge necessary to commit the offence charged. Taylor DCJ sentenced the appellant to a total term of imprisonment of 11 years, with a non-parole period of 7 years, 6 months, commencing from 6 July 2010 when he was arrested in the company of Mr Pham. The maximum penalty for this offence was life imprisonment and the standard non-parole period 15 years.

5Mr Pham pleaded guilty to his offence in the Local Court. He was sentenced by Cogswell DCJ to a total term of imprisonment of 13 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 9 years, 6 months, after a 25% discount for his plea. The starting point for his sentence before discount was 18 years. An appeal against the severity of his sentence was dismissed (see Pham v R [2013] NSWCCA 217). 

6The appellant advanced one ground in relation to his conviction and one in relation to his sentence:

Conviction - The judge erred in failing to put the defence case in summing up to the jury.

Sentence - The judge erred in giving the standard non-parole period determinative significance.


The cases at trial

7The trial commenced on 10 May 2011. The appellant gave evidence on 16 May, the same day the parties addressed the jury. Taylor DCJ summed up on 17 May and the verdict was delivered on 19 May. His Honour's sentencing remarks outline the evidence at trial, much of which was not in dispute.

8The appellant was arrested during a controlled police operation in which police had substituted 240kg of cocaine which had been secreted in pavers with a similar substance. The cocaine had been detected by the Australian Customs Service in a consignment of pavers imported from Mexico in two containers. They arrived in Melbourne in June 2010. On 14 June, the Australian Federal Police examined the containers, found 240kg of cocaine and later made the substitute.

9On 18 June, the containers were delivered to a warehouse in Victoria. A Mexican national took delivery. He sorted the pavers and on 2 July, pavers containing the substitute were loaded onto a truck and driven to Sydney, where they were delivered to another Mexican national.

10They unloaded the pavers into a garage and purchased equipment then used to break open the pavers. On 4 July, police, who were using an authorised listening device, heard the pavers being opened. They executed a search warrant, made an arrest and seized a Land Rover and a BlackBerry phone. Examination of the phone revealed emails exchanged with the intended recipients of the cocaine. It was used to make contact with them.

11The controlled operation was pursued using information obtained from the emails, which included 'ask for Adam', referred to '30 in one go', provided a mobile phone number and the last four digits '0838'. The purchaser was 'Tommy'. An undercover police operative 'Damian' using the name 'Adam', phoned the number and made arrangements to meet a person who identified himself as 'Tommy' at the carpark at a McDonald's at Botany at 6.30pm on 6 July. Their conversations were recorded.

12Before the arranged meeting the appellant and Mr Pham were observed outside in a Mazda. Damian drove the seized Land Rover into the McDonald's carpark shortly before 6.30pm. He was wearing a recording device. Mr Pham drove into the carpark with the appellant in the passenger seat. Damian had a phone conversation with Mr Pham, which was also recorded. They confirmed that they were both at the carpark. Damian claimed his leg was injured and asked Mr Pham to go to his car.

13The appellant approached Damian near the Land Rover. Their conversation was also recorded. The serial number '0838' was identified and the appellant gave Damian a $5 note ending in that number. 

14Mr Pham moved the Mazda and parked it beside the Land Rover. Damian showed the appellant two large plastic bags in the back of the Land Rover, one inside the other. They contained 30kg of the substance substituted for the cocaine wrapped in clear plastic and taped.

15The Crown's case was that the appellant appeared to look inside the bag, lift it and put it back down. He then walked to the Mazda, tapped on the boot, which Mr Pham released and the lid rose. The appellant returned to the Land Rover and reached in to grab the bag, when police intervened and arrested the appellant, Mr Pham and Damian. 

16Mr Pham was found in possession of the phone with the number referred to in the email taken from the seized BlackBerry. It contained an email stating 'ask for Adam, serial number 0838'. The $5 note which the appellant gave Damian was 'DH05470838'.

17The appellant gave evidence at the trial that he had known Mr Pham since school and that he had gone with him on 6 July 2010 to his mother's house, where he received a phone call. Mr Pham asked him to go for a drive and told him they were going to McDonald's at Mascot. After they had eaten there, Mr Pham said he had to wait for a friend. They waited for a while and as they were leaving to buy cigarettes, a four wheel drive drove in. Mr Pham told him he thought it was the person he was supposed to meet.

18The four wheel drive drove away and they drove to a service station at the front of McDonald's. He went in and bought cigarettes. Mr Pham received a phone call in which he said 'I can see you'. He then asked the appellant to give the guy a $5 note.

19The appellant got out of the car and the guy called to him. He walked over and they spoke about his leg. He was not sure if he was the guy to whom he was to give the note. 

20The recorded conversation was:

""UCO Yeah. I didn't' even see your car there man.

NGUYEN Yeah man, same,. Yeah what note is it, man?

UCO Ah, do you have it?

NGUYEN Yeah man.

UCO Yeah?

NGUYEN Yeah.

UCO What is it?

NGUYEN Oh ...

UCO Zero eight three eight (0838), yeah is that the one you got?

NGUYEN Haven't looked. Yeah man. Awesome.

UCO Yeah. Double check it.

NGUYEN Yeah we're good man, we're good.

UCO Yeah?

NGUYEN Yeah. Alright.

UCO I'd help you bro, but my leg. "" 



21The appellant's evidence was that the guy started talking about some digits. He did not know what he was talking about. The guy pointed to the note and he looked at it and said 'Yeah awesome man'. The guy asked him to double check it and he did. The guy said 'Yeah we're good man, we're good'.

22The guy then opened the boot where the appellant saw a bag. The guy said 'I'd help you, but my leg' and gestured to the bag. He did not know what to do. He went back to Mr Pham's car and knocked on the window and may have tapped on the boot. He told Mr Pham that the guy had something for him. He walked back to the guy and they spoke again about his leg. Police then intervened and they were arrested. He denied having looked inside the bag or picking it up.

23The case advanced for the appellant at trial was that he was not guilty and was entitled to the presumption of innocence, which required that the jury be sceptical of the case against him, demanding powerful cogent proof before they convicted him, having regard to the onus which fell on the Crown, to prove each element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt.

24It was submitted that they would conclude that the police operative Damien was not a reliable witness and that the standard of proof was not lowered, because the appellant was a friend of the accused. They could not convict him on the basis of guilt by association. Suspicion and conjecture was not sufficient. It was also submitted that Police evidence was on occasion fabricated and had been in this case. 

25The appellant had not been the subject of the police operation, during which many photos and video recordings had been made, but none were taken of the McDonald's meeting, the arrest phase of the operation. Nor had there been any fingerprint or DNA analysis of the bag the appellant was alleged to have picked up, while the $5 note had been tested. Those steps had not been taken, it was submitted, because the observations of the undercover operative Damien had been fabricated. The appellant had not picked up the bag.

26The evidence, it was submitted, was not enough to convict the appellant. It could not establish that the drugs were in the appellant's possession at the time of his arrest. Other officers had not seen him pick up the bag or tap on the Mazda's boot and speak to Mr Pham. CCTV footage showed him walking to Mr Pham and returning to the Land Rover. 

27The appellant's lack of prior convictions was submitted to be relevant to the assessment of his evidence. It was also relevant that it was the operative who had asked him about the serial number of the note, knowing that the conversation was to be recorded. The appellant's answer showed that he didn't know about the code. The conversation and the appellant then returning to Mr Pham were consistent with him not picking up the bag, or being complicit in the offence. 

28It was submitted that picking it up and putting it back down in the Land Rover made no sense if the appellant was involved, as did the absence of any conversation about the drugs. Further, the record which the operative later made of what he had observed did not record the appellant picking up the bag and checking its contents, which didn't corroborate what the operative claimed to have seen. 

29The appellant had not been bound to give evidence, but did so. He was inexperienced in giving evidence, but the police were not. The operative was skilful in the art of deception and it was not easy to decide if he was telling the truth. The appellant said he trusted Mr Pham, but was troubled about the bags he was shown and so went to Mr Pham, who he wanted to get out and speak to Damian, because he didn't know what was going on. Even if that evidence were not accepted, it did not follow that the appellant would be convicted. The behaviour of the police did not need to be rubber stamped by the jury. Their evidence had to be approached cautiously, given that it was alleged that the appellant had picked up the bag twice, which made no sense.

Conviction appeal - summing up

30There was no issue between the parties as to the trial judge's obligation to put the defence case to the jury in summing up (see Wong v R [2009] NSWCCA 101 at [129] - [146]). Whether that obligation was met was in issue.

31There was no complaint at trial that his Honour had not fairly put the defence case in his summing up and no further directions were then sought. In these circumstances, Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. It requires the appellant to obtain leave to rely on this ground. 

32Leave under Rule 4 is not a technicality. As discussed in ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [147] - [148]:

""147 The effect of the rule was summarised by McHugh J in Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; (1999) 196 CLR 297 as follows (at [72]):

""There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted ... ""

148 Subsequent cases have established that the following matters are important in considering the operation of r 4:

The requirements of r 4 are not mere technicalities. The Criminal Appeal Act does not exist to enable an accused who has been convicted on one set of issues to have a new trial under a new set of issues which could or should have been raised at the first trial: R v ITA [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [94], citing with approval R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310, 319. See also Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62 at [170].

The appellant must establish that he or she has lost a real chance (or a chance fairly open) of being acquitted: Picken v R [2007] NSWCCA 319 at [20]-[21].

A failure by counsel to take objection or to raise an issue on summing-up may be explicable by the fact that counsel said nothing hoping to gain an advantage at a later stage, or that counsel took no objection as, in the atmosphere of the trial, counsel saw no injustice as to what was being done: Germakian v R [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at [10]-[13]; Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171; (2009) 196 A Crim R 472 at [58]-[61].

An unexplained failure to take the point at the trial is usually a reasonably reliable indicator of the fairness and adequacy of the summing-up: Tekely v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [88], [130].""



33The appellant contended that the trial judge's directions were so deficient that leave to rely on this ground would be given, the deficiency having struck at the root of the trial (see AS v R [2010] NSWCCA 218 at [20].)

34This submission cannot be accepted. 

35Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) provides that a judge need not summarise the evidence to a jury at the end of the trial, if of the opinion that in all of the circumstances of a trial, a summary is not necessary. What is required is an even balance between the cases of the prosecution and the accused, fairly directing the jury to the matters raised by the accused in his defence (see Cleland v the Queen (1982) 151 CLR 1 at 10). 

36What was required of the trial judge was, as Wood CJ at CL explained in R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 (at [76]) that he: 

' ... explain why it is that the accused asserts that his guilt has not been established beyond reasonable doubt ... So far as the accused is concerned, it is the case which the defence makes that the jury must be given to understand, including any matter that is properly open upon which they might find for the accused: Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107.""


37In summing up his Honour directed the jury to what was in issue, which he correctly identified to have been narrow, essentially requiring the jury to determine what had happened at McDonald's at 6.30pm on 6 July 2010, which he said was of critical importance.

38After giving general directions as to the jury's task, how they should approach it and the onus which fell on the Crown his Honour explained the elements of the offence. His Honour then turned to how the Crown put its case, referring to the matters not in dispute and directing that what happened at the carpark was of critical importance in the case. His Honour then gave general directions as to how the evidence was to be assessed and how inferences could be drawn, explaining the inferences on which the Crown's case rested.

39His Honour did not summarise the evidence which the jury had recently heard. He gave directions as to the evidence which the appellant had given and how it was to be approached, given that it was not challenged that he was a person of good character.

40His Honour then turned to the Crown's arguments, noting that it was the appellant's case that the evidence of Damian and other police officers had been fabricated and the appellant's explanation for the recordings made at the carpark. He noted that there was no suggestion that the appellant had been involved in the importation and that the Crown's case against him was that it was inherently unlikely that he was involved at the carpark, not knowing what was going on, because it was inherently unlikely that Mr Pham would take someone not involved and who he could trust, to collect the drugs.

41His Honour directed the jury to carefully consider the conversation between Damian and the appellant and the submissions which the Crown and the appellant had made about that conversation and what had happened with the boot of the Mazda.

42In summarising the Crown's address his Honour also raised points taken by the appellant, explaining that the lynchpin in its case was the evidence given by Damian, an undercover operative, whose evidence was in part not supported by other police officers. His Honour directed:

""... I direct that you must scrutinise it carefully before you can reach the conclusions contended for by the Crown. I direct you that his evidence was that of a person who is experienced in undercover operations and that it is part of his work to adopt roles and everything that goes with it, including lying. I say that to you just to make sure I have communicated to you, that is the reason that you will scrutinise the evidence carefully, also because it's critical to the Crown case. The Crown has put to you there was an explanation for all the other officers not observing what was happening by the car. You have heard that evidence and that there is some support for his observations in the evidence of Officer Downey, which of course was challenged by the accused.""


43His Honour then turned to the appellant's case, noting that it had rested on the presumption of innocence, the onus which fell on the Crown, and the evidence which the appellant had only recently given. His Honour did not summarise that evidence, which he said was of obvious importance and which had to be considered in light of the submissions put by defence counsel. 

44He dealt with the defence submissions directing that:

""An accused in a criminal trial is not obliged to give evidence. When an accused gives evidence, he or she becomes a witness like any other witness in a trial, and you evaluate the witness exactly on the same basis as I have described to you. The important direction to give is that by taking the step of giving evidence then it is not to be taken as a concession, in any way and it should not divert you from the understanding that you will have, that the Crown must prove the case. It is not for the accused to prove anything. Mr Wilkinson then addressed you consistently with what the Crown Prosecutor said about the importation and confirmed to you that the accused had nothing to do with that importation, which is the correct position."" 



45The appellant was represented at the trial by experienced counsel who addressed the narrow point on which the appellant's case rested, after a short trial. The parties' submissions were closely followed by succinct but adequate directions about which no complaint was made by appellant's counsel. There was no explanation for that on appeal, but on the material it is evident. There was no error in his Honour's approach. It satisfied the obligation which fell upon him to put the defence case to the jury, directing attention to the matters relied on, which assisted the case he advanced. No miscarriage of justice can have flowed from his Honour's approach. There was no error in defence counsel then not seeking any further direction in relation to the appellant's case. No real injustice has been revealed, given the course which the trial took and what was there in issue.

46In the result leave under Rule 4 must be refused and the appeal dismissed.

Sentence appeal

47The appellant was convicted of a serious offence, involving 30 kg of cocaine. The standard non-parole period fixed for a mid-range offence of this kind was 15 years and the maximum penalty life imprisonment. 

48On sentencing Taylor DCJ found that:

""He comes before this Court for sentence on what he did. In the ordinary course I could expect that he may have had very limited knowledge of the whole of the operation. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did what he is alleged to have done. I have carefully considered his association with Pham. I accept that the offender's role did not involve planning and organisation. There is no persuasive evidence to suggest that this was other than an isolated offending in the context of a debt that he was otherwise unable to pay and some drug use. He was involved on the day of 6 July at the request of his co-offender and played a small part at the bottom of the hierarchy.""


49It was not suggested that those conclusions did not accurately reflect the evidence on sentencing. 

50The appellant was aged 24 years. He had only one prior conviction for an offence of driving with a low range prescribed concentration of alcohol. He resided with his mother and three siblings, who supported him. His parents had separated and he had no contact with his father. He had past employment as a kitchen hand, packer, cashier and in a call centre, prior to a back injury at work in 2007 and further injury in a car accident in 2009. He suffered ongoing pain and difficulty maintaining employment.

51The appellant had history of drug abuse, with ecstasy use at age 18 and ice use three times weekly from 2 years prior to sentence. There was alcohol abuse after the breakdown of his relationship in 2009 and a gambling problem, of some $500 per fortnight. He was intending as a consequence to become bankrupt prior to his arrest.

52He had been in custody since arrest, drug free, involved in no misconduct. He was employed in a textile workshop as a machinist, where his work was highly regarded

53His Honour found :
""A recitation of the facts of the matter earlier and the findings on sentence for Pham indicate an involvement by him, that is by Pham, much greater than the present offender. I think it is fair to accept Mr Nguyen's statement to the Probation and Parole Service that he was not involved in dealing with drugs, but was accompanying Mr Pham.

For the reasons I have given I find the offence falls at the lower end of the middle range, towards the bottom of the middle range of objective seriousness. This is because I accept Mr Nguyen's role in the transaction.

I have considered the schedule of cases handed up by the Crown, which includes Pham's case.

Taking all of these matters into account and with particular reference to the maximum penalty available, the standard non-parole period and where this matter lies within the range of objective seriousness, I regard a sentence of eleven years imprisonment is appropriate for this crime.


54Mr Pham's greater involvement in this offence was reflected in the total term of the sentence imposed upon him, 13 years, 6 months, with a non-parole period of 9 years, 6 months after a 25% discount for a plea, which reflected a starting point of 18 years. By comparison, the appellant was sentenced to a term of 11 years and a non-parole period of 7 years, 6 months.

55That conclusion may perhaps have reflected a view on his Honour's part that the sentence imposed on Mr Pham was stern, as was later found on appeal (see Pham at [45]). It was not, however, found to be ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".

56The sentence was imposed before the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 was given. The appellant was thus sentenced according to the principles in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 which required a two stage process involving a consideration being given to where the offence stood on a hypothetical range of objective seriousness. Muldrock overturned Way.

57It was the appellant's case that his Honour had wrongly adopted a two stage approach to the sentence, by reference to the standard non-parole period in accordance with the Way judgment and that a lesser sentence would have been imposed upon him, if the standard non-parole period had not unduly constrained this sentencing exercise. Although the quantity of drugs involved was large, given the small compass of the appellant's offending, the sentence of 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years, 6 months was not warranted for his offence.

58In Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 it was observed at [26] that:

""... Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre- Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error. What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene. Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it. It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick.""


59Like Butler, here little suggests that such an error occurred in this case. 

60At the sentence hearing the appellant accepted that his offence was a very serious one, given the quantity of the drugs involved, a matter which had to be taken into account. That concession was plainly connect. This was a very serious offence. It was also submitted that the amount of the drug involved could not be considered in isolation. The offender had to be sentenced for what he had done in the context of this criminal undertaking.

61He was Mr Pham's underling and had accompanied him so that Mr Pham could take possession of the drugs and transport them. It was Mr Pham who had arranged the pickup and the appellant had merely assisted him. He was not an intrinsic part of the enterprise, but had become involved in the collection of the drugs. 

62These matters and his subjective circumstances where such that:

""... in my submission there is a greater level of criminality by Pham such that notwithstanding his plea of not guilty the objective criminality would equate to similar sentences being imposed on this offender.

HIS HONOUR: Sorry would you repeat that please?

WILKINSON: Yes. Your Honour what I'm indicating is that because of the greater level of criminality as I've submitted in respect of Pham but notwithstanding the plea of not guilty that was entered by this offender, but the objective criminality of this offender would equate to a similar sentence being imposed as that was imposed on Pham, because the level of his criminality is lower. One of the matters that your Honour's got to look at-

HIS HONOUR: You say it's lower but it's balanced by the plea of not guilty.

WILKINSON: That's so your Honour.

HIS HONOUR: So the outcome would be similar.""



63How the appellant's case was conducted at trial may not be overlooked on appeal. As discussed in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [81]:

""The Victorian Court of Appeal has emphasised recently, that in sentencing appeals, the Court is reviewing the exercise of a discretionary judgment and not rehearing a plea of mitigation. It is not the occasion for the revision and reformulation of the case presented below. The Court will not lightly entertain arguments that could have been put, but were not advanced on the plea, and will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or are a contradiction of submissions previously made. The Court spoke of the need for exceptional circumstances before this can be done, where it can be shown that there was most compelling material available on the plea that was not used or understood, and which demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice arising from the plea and sentence: Romero v R [2011] VSCA 45 at [11]; Keane v R [2011] VSCA 156 at [13],[18]; Bayram v R [2012] VSCA 6 at [28]-[29].""


64Given the way in which the appellant's case was advanced to his Honour, the approach which he adopted to the evidence and the comparison which had to be drawn with the sentence imposed on Mr Pham, having regard to the appellant's differing circumstances and offending, his Honour's observations do not suggest that that this sentence was wrongly determined by a two stage approach 'tethered' to the standard non-parole period. That was a matter properly to be taken into account, as was the maximum penalty and the other matters which he took into account, including the case advanced by the appellant.

65As it transpired, his Honour concluded that the appellant's offending was much less than that of Mr Pham. The standard non-parole period was 15 years. After a 25% discount, Mr Pham received a non-parole period of 9 years, 6 months and the appellant a non-parole period of 7 years, 6 months, without discount. That conclusion confirms that his Honour did not fall into the error for which the appellant contended. 

66In the result the leave to appeal this sentence must be refused.

Orders

67For the reasons given, I would order:

1. The conviction appeal be dismissed.
2. Leave to appeal the sentence is refused.

		26 February 2014",2014-02-25 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705462,Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Leahy [2014] NSWCCA 279,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J.
2ADAMS J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  On Friday 28 February 2014 the Court heard an application by the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) for the review of a decision of Barr AJ on 25 February 2014 granting conditional bail to the respondent.  At the conclusion of the hearing the Court made orders revoking that decision and refusing bail.  The following are my reasons for joining in the making of those orders.
The alleged offences
4The respondent was charged on 25 July 2013 with an offence contrary to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and a further offence of contravening an apprehended domestic violence order pursuant to s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 (NSW).  The former is an offence carrying a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  The latter carries 2 years imprisonment or a fine of $5,500 or both.  The alleged victim of the s 33(1)(b) offence is Ms Melanie Dunbar.  Ms Dunbar is also the person protected by the order the respondent is alleged to have breached.
5The respondent had been held in custody bail refused since being charged and the matter is next listed for mention before the Local Court at Albury on 10 March 2014.
Review of bail decisions
6Section 45(1)(b) of the Bail Act 1978 (NSW) provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal may review any decision in relation to bail of, inter alia, the Supreme Court.  Such a review is conducted as a hearing de novo:  R v Petroulias [2010] NSWCCA 95 at [13]; R v Chehab [2013] NSWCCA 62 at [2].
Alleged facts
7The complainant and respondent had been in a relationship for the past six years or so.  They had been living at an address in West Albury for two years.  They have various children who reside elsewhere.  The police facts assert that there had been a history of domestic violence incidents, some of which had been reported to police but also some which had not.
8On 23 January 2013 an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) was made which included a condition that the respondent not assault the complainant.  On 4 July 2013 the complainant is said to have returned to the home after visiting two of her children.  The respondent was in the lounge room and is alleged to have been intoxicated.  Also present was the 12 year old daughter of the respondent from a previous relationship.
9There was a conversation concerning where the complainant had been and an argument ensued.  This culminated in a physical struggle which included the respondent striking the complainant with a closed fist to her face causing her to fall to the floor.  The respondent is then said to have kicked her in the head a number of times with so much force that her body rolled over.  The police assert that the respondent was wearing work boots at the time.
10As the respondent was kicking the complainant his daughter was yelling at him to stop.  At this point ""a witness"" entered the premises and observed certain injuries including that the complainant had one of her eyes half closed.  The witness and the respondent then left the premises without attempting to seek any medical attention for the complainant.
11The complainant did not report the matter to police but attended hospital and sought medical treatment.  No significant injury was detected at that stage but there is a question as to the thoroughness with which she was examined.  She thereafter continued to experience pain and consulted a general practitioner who referred her to a maxillofacial surgeon.  A CT scan indicated a comminuted depressed left zygomatic arch fracture.  The complainant underwent surgery on 2 August 2013 where the fracture was surgically opened and reduced.  It is said that the procedure was entirely successful.  The surgeon, Dr Hennessy, asserts in his statement that, ""this sort of injury is consistent with a blow of substantial force and if the direction or site of the blow could have been different the outcome could have been catastrophic"".
12The respondent attended the Albury Police Station on 25 July 2013.  (It is not entirely clear but it appears that the complainant reported the matter sometime between 19 July and that date.)  He agreed to be interviewed by police.  He is said to have told the officers that he had no memory of the assault and that he was intoxicated at the time.  He also told the police that he and the complainant had engaged in numerous domestic violence incidents since the death of their son in 2010 and he admitted to having made threats to kill her.
13Finally, the police facts assert that the victim had not returned to the home ""due to fears she holds for her safety and the safety of her children"".
Subjective features
14The respondent was born in 1982 and so he is now aged 31. 
15He has a criminal history but has not previously been in gaol.  The history includes that on 25 October 2005 he was fined and placed on bonds in the Albury Local Court for assaulting and resisting a police officer in the execution of the officer's duty.  On 16 August 2011 he was fined in the Wodonga Magistrate's Court for threatening to inflict serious injury.
16On 1 March 2012 the respondent was convicted of contravening an ADVO.  The respondent had been served with an ADVO on 29 August 2011.  The conditions included that he not approach the complainant when intoxicated and that he not enter or loiter about premises where she lived.  On 29 February 2012 he went to the complainant's home at her invitation and spent time with her and the children.  Sometime during the evening he accused the complainant of cheating on him and an argument ensued over a number of hours.  In the early hours of the following morning he went to the kitchen and obtained knives and proceeded to cut his wrists and thereafter damaged various items in the kitchen including punching a hole in the wall.  The complainant tried to call the police but he smashed the phone.  She found another phone and took it to her eldest son and asked him to call the police.  The police attended and found the respondent to be moderately affected by alcohol.  In respect of this matter he was fined and placed on a two year good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) with a condition that he accept supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and obey reasonable directions concerning various things including drug and alcohol rehabilitation.
17On 10 October 2012 a warrant was issued for the respondent's arrest for having breached his bond.  He was arrested and dealt with on 12 November 2012 when a further two year s 9 good behaviour bond was imposed.
18On 23 January 2013 the respondent was called up again for having breached his bond and once again was placed upon a two year s 9 good behaviour bond; again with conditions requiring him to obey directions of the Probation and Parole Service in relation to drug and alcohol rehabilitation.  On the same occasion the respondent was also convicted of two charges of damaging property and placed on further two year s 9 good behaviour bonds.
19For reasons which are not apparent, further warrants were issued on 9 July 2013 for the arrest of the respondent for being in breach of an order.  On 10 July 2013 he was once again dealt with for having breached the good behaviour bond relating to the offence of contravening an ADVO.  Yet again he was placed upon a two year s 9 good behaviour bond.  
20The police bail report in respect of the respondent includes two entries of having breached bail, namely on 22 October 2012 and 4 November 2012.  The latter breach involved a failure to report to police as required on three occasions in late October/early November 2012.  
21The position then was that as at 4 July 2013 when the subject offences were alleged to have been committed the respondent was subject to a ADVO and three good behaviour bonds.  
The bail determination of 25 February 2014
22Barr AJ granted bail on very strict conditions.  They included a residential condition with a curfew; that the respondent report to police each day; that he not enter West Albury and not make any attempt to approach the complainant or their child; that he not consume alcohol or any illicit drug or enter any premises where alcohol is sold.  There was also a condition that an acceptable person enter into an agreement without security to forfeit $5,000 if he failed to comply with his bail.
23The address to which the respondent was bailed was his mother's home in Lavington.  There was material before Barr AJ indicating that Ms Leahy was prepared to have her son live with her and that she acknowledged the need for him to comply with strict bail conditions.  Further similar material was placed before the Court last Friday.  Also before the Court was a letter from the respondent's father confirming his preparedness to be the acceptable person and also generally indicating his support for his son.
Submissions
24It was common ground that the present matter was one for which the Bail Act did not provide any presumption for or against bail.  
25The Crown submitted that in relation to the support the respondent had from his parents, it might reasonably be supposed that he had enjoyed that support through the years of his relationship with the complainant and it had not served to discourage him from engaging in domestic violence.
26It was submitted that the history of breaching an ADVO and good behaviour bonds gave little confidence in the respondent's capacity to comply with court orders.  In short, he had ignored court orders on so many occasions in the past that there was no reason to think that he would not do so in the future. 
27The primary concern raised in opposition to bail was the safety of the complainant.  The submission was put quite bluntly:  ""whilst the respondent is at large Ms Dunbar is in danger"".  This danger was said to be now magnified by her being in a position of being a important witness against the respondent in relation to serious charges which carry the maximum penalties set out earlier and, in the case of the s 33 offence, a standard non-parole period of some significance.  
28It was submitted that the Crown case was a strong one.  The respondent did not deny that he was present in the home on the night the complainant sustained her serious injury.  He did not deny assaulting her but merely claimed a lack of memory.  He admitted having observed bruising when he awoke the following morning.  The strength of the Crown case was said to provide an additional concern as to whether the respondent would appear in court with the likelihood being that a significant custodial sentence would be imposed if convicted.  
29For the respondent it was observed that he had never failed to appear in court in the past and had never been sentenced to a term of imprisonment.  He has now spent a period of about seven months in custody.  This would serve as disincentive for him to fail to comply with his bail and run the risk of being returned to custody.
30In relation to the prosecution's concern for the protection of the complainant, it was submitted in addition to the matter just mentioned that the nature of the alleged offending was of a gravity significantly beyond anything that had occurred in the past and in that sense should be regarded as being ""somewhat out of character and not likely to be repeated"".  Further, it was submitted that in the past the incidents of domestic violence had occurred when the complainant and respondent were under the one roof whereas the conditions of bail imposed by Barr AJ required the respondent to live some nine kilometres away, abide by a curfew, not have any contact with the complainant, and not enter West Albury.  The bail regime imposed by his Honour was such that the police had an ability to monitor the respondent's compliance with his obligations.  A further matter put in this context was that the involvement of respondent's parents would also help to ensure separation of the respondent from the complainant and compliance generally with his bail.
31In relation to any concerns about interference by the respondent with the complainant or witnesses, it was submitted that this was based upon nothing more than a theoretical capacity to interfere and no more.
32An important matter, it was submitted, was the fact that the respondent had attended the hearing of the prosecution's application which served to illustrate that he was not a flight risk.
33Arguments were raised as to the strength of the Crown case.  Whether the injuries sustained by the complainant amounted to grievous bodily harm was said to be controversial.  But Mr Quilter, counsel for the respondent, with commendable candour, drew the Court's attention to Haoui v R [2008] NSWCCA 209; (2008) 188 A Crim R 331.  In that case Johnson J, McCallum J agreeing, Beazley JA (as her Honour then was) dissenting, held that it was open to a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a similar type of injury amounted to grievous bodily harm.
34The delay in the resolution of the matter was also the subject of submissions.  The matter commenced with the respondent being charged on 25 July 2013 and it is still pending in the Local Court.  The next listing on 10 March 2014 is only for mention.  The Court was informed that, at best, it could be hoped that the matter might come on for trial in the October sittings of the District Court at Albury.  The delay in the matter has apparently been occasioned by negotiations which have been proceeding between the respondent's representatives and the prosecution as to whether a plea to some lesser charge might be accepted.  
Consideration
35The safety of the complainant is a significant consideration in a case such as this.  There is a demonstrated history of domestic violence between the respondent and the complainant which, on his own admission, has involved him even threatening to kill her.  The allegation in relation to the incident in question is troubling in that the respondent is alleged to have perpetrated a very brutal assault, involving as it did kicking the complainant a number of times in the head when she was on the ground whilst he was wearing work boots.  The injury she sustained, on any view, was a significant one.
36The respondent's history of breaching an ADVO, repeatedly breaching a good behaviour bond, and being subject to both an ADVO and a number of good behaviour bonds at the time of the alleged commission of the present offences is equally troubling.
37The proposal that the applicant be subject to strict conditions but still live in the general vicinity of where the complainant resides provides little comfort in terms of her safety.  Not only is there the history of domestic violence between the pair, there is now the additional inherent incentive for the respondent to interfere with the complainant on the basis that she is the principal witness against him in respect of a matter for which if he is convicted he will likely be sentenced to a significant term of imprisonment.
38The respondent's history does not raise any great concern about his attendance in court although it must be said that his past history has involved matters far less serious than the present.
39The delay in the resolution of the matter is a concern.  My consideration of the matter has proceeded with an assumption that if the matter does proceed to trial it will do so in the latter part of this year.  If it did emerge that the matter was likely not to be resolved until 2015 then there would be further serious concern about the time the respondent will have been held in custody.  If that should eventuate I would suggest that the question of bail should be revisited.
40In conclusion, in the light of the history of violence at the hands of the respondent and his demonstrated preparedness to flout court orders, I am concerned for the safety of the complainant: s 32(1)(b1)(i) of the Bail Act.  I was not persuaded that even conditions as strict as those imposed by Barr AJ would adequately mitigate the risk of the further violence befalling her. For those reasons I joined in the making of the following orders which I formally set out as follows:
1. Revoke the order of Barr AJ of 25 February 2014 granting the respondent bail.
 2. Bail is refused.

		26 November 2014",2014-02-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705463,"R v Pinyosap, Surachai [2014] NSWDC 349","SENTENCE


	
	HER HONOUR: The offender is before me for sentence following his plea of guilty in the Local Court to one count contrary to s 307.1 of the Criminal Code namely, that on 19 May 2013 he imported a commercial quantity of the drug heroin into Australia. Brought under that section this offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The sentence for this matter must be in accordance with the relevant provision of the Crimes Act, 1900 and, specifically, the provisions of s 16A must be addressed.
	
	
	The offender is a Thai national who has been a long term resident in Australia, living in Sydney. He is now 26 and was about to turn 26 when he committed this offence. He travelled to Bangkok in early May 2013 and returned on 19 May 2013 on a flight arriving from Bangkok into Sydney Airport. On his incoming passenger card he indicated that he was not carrying any prohibited goods, including illicit drugs. He had two suitcases, which were examined by Customs, who identified an off-white powder concealed inside the inner lining of both which tested presumptively for heroin.
	
	
	The Australian Federal Police then attended the airport and arrested the offender. They conducted an interview with him shortly afterwards in which he admitted that he was importing illegal drugs into Australia in these two suitcases. Specifically in the record of interview he told police that he was in debt for an amount of about $110,000 to various people as a result of his excessive gambling which had become a problem. He told police that in particular he owed a significant amount to a person he named. He said that in January 2013 he had done a similar trip to Thailand at the request of this person and brought back suitcases which he knew contained drugs and then handed them over to an unknown man at his home. This, he said, was at the request of the person who had loaned him a significant amount of money and he undertook the trip to reduce the debt he had to that person. He said that the same person approached him before May 2013 to do a similar trip.
	
	
	I accept from his evidence that the suitcases were delivered to him in Bangkok the day before he left to come home and he knew there were drugs inside, although he did not see them and he did not know specifically either what the drugs were or the quantity of them. The bags were heavier than they ought to have been however and it alerted him to the fact that there was something concealed inside.
	
	
	He told police in the interview that this person to whom he owed money had paid for his air tickets and had sent him a sum of somewhere between $2,000 and $5,000 whilst he was in Thailand for spending money. His expectation was that he would take the bags to his house where someone would find and take delivery of them. He told police that he expected to receive $80,000 in return for undertaking this trip, which I accept he intended to use to repay some of the accumulated gambling debt.
	
	
	I accept, from reading some parts of the record of interview and evidence both from the offender and his partner, that he had tried some other methods to repay the debt before taking this second trip, including considering selling the apartment in which he lived with his partner and child and which they had bought about 18 months previously. He realised however that the net gain would only be $10,000, which was not sufficient to repay the debt.
	
	
	I also accept that for about a month or so before he took this trip in May 2013 there had been pressure brought to bear on both him and his partner, including some threats made to them either by or on behalf of those to whom he owed the money. In particular I accept that a person attended the house in which he lived and threatened his partner and child, and that threats had been made to him as well that he and his family would be hurt if he did not repay the money. None of this amounts to duress of the type that would be a defence, but I accept from the content of his record of interview with the police, supported as it is by the evidence he has given and that of his partner, that these threats were in fact made. I accept that he took them seriously and that was in the mix of events, which motivated him to take this trip, knowing that he would be importing drugs.
	
	
	Analysis of the substances found in the suitcase indicated a gross weight of 3.518 kilograms of the substance which, when analysed, was 1.939 kilograms of pure heroin. The commercial quantity of heroin for S307.1 is an amount above 1.5 kilograms. Therefore this is a very substantial quantity of heroin in its own terms, but not significantly above the bottom of the range for a commercial quantity of this drug. Nonetheless, it is a very large amount of heroin, which I accept from the agreed facts had a wholesale value of just over $739,000 and if it had reached the street for sale would have returned around $2 million.
	
	
	This is clearly a very serious offence. The maximum penalty of life imprisonment makes that perfectly clear. In addition, the courts are only too aware of the tragedy and harm caused by drugs within the community, both to those who become addicted to them and to their families and people in the community who become the victims, particularly heroin addicts, who then commit other offences to fund that addiction. The sentence passed here must send a message to the community that significant periods of imprisonment will be the result should they decide to import drugs into the country. The cost of policing the airports and similar places, detecting these importations is significant. All of those matters require a real message of general deterrence to be incorporated into the sentence.
	
	
	The offender comes to court with no prior criminal convictions and he is entitled to have this taken into account in assessing the appropriate penalty. However, because of his own admission of having engaged in similar conduct only five months beforehand, he is not entitled to have me regard his offence as a one-off isolated incident.
	
	
	His role within what was no doubt some form of drug syndicate is a relevant matter to take into account in terms of assessing his criminality. He is, it seems to me, properly described as a courier. He is not a mere courier because he elected and planned to leave the country, knowing he was going to collect drugs and come back with them. That puts him slightly above the role of mere courier, but he was nonetheless a courier. He played no part in the organisation of this syndicate, made none of the plans and acted as directed.
	
	
	I accept from the evidence before me, both from him and from hospital records, that his motivation for committing the offence was obviously for financial gain but in his case it was for financial gain in order that he could repay a debt that he had accumulated as a result of having a significant gambling addiction. Whilst this does not operate significantly as a factor of mitigation it is nonetheless a matter to take into account in assessing his moral culpability and also in terms of attempting to assess his prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I accept that from the time he was about 18 he started to gamble excessively on gaming machines. This was not helped by the fact that he was for the seven years or so before this offence working as a bar attendant at the Cabra-Vale Diggers Club in Cabramatta where his job description included bar attendant and gaming attendant. I also accept that the majority of those who had loaned him money were patrons and still are patrons of that club and it must be patently obvious to those who operate that club that there are people there taking advantage of members or staff like this offender, lending them money that they must know can never be repaid from wages of about $750 a week, charging interest at an exorbitant rate and then, as is only too frequently known to this Court, using them as couriers to bring drugs back into the country.
	
	
	The fact that one of these people at least, and more probably than not one of those who threatened this offender and his partner is still there, still a member, still engaging in the same behaviour even after this offender has brought it to the notice of the police, is a very troubling matter. I accept however that that would appear to be what is happening and it is well known to this Court that the Cabra-Vale Diggers Club is but one of many in that part of Sydney where exactly the same thing happens every day of the week. It would be comforting to think that the licensing and gaming authorities in this State would attempt to do something to deal with these sorts of issues that are obvious and very known to the Courts and must be obvious to those who run these clubs.
	
	
	In any event I accept that for about the last seven years the offender’s gambling addiction has become worse. He borrowed more and more money. He was less able to pay it back. He continued to borrow money in order to pay back that which he owed and to gamble. Inevitably he lost when he played the gaming machines, as does everyone. He gambled at the Star City Casino, often spending a day there and sometimes five days, losing up to $5,000 a day and that was the motivator for his commission of this offence.
	
	
	He tried to address his gambling problems in 2011, I accept more probably than not connected with the birth of his daughter. He went to Liverpool Hospital, saw a psychologist there, was given some advice but did not pursue that advice and did not stay with the service. He seems to have given up a little too easily with the inevitable outcome that has led to his being here in the dock and in gaol for a significant period of time.
	
	
	He recognises his addiction and I accept is now well motivated to address it. As I understand it, from seeing many similar cases in court over a number of years, gambling addictions are not easy to deal with but he requires treatment as soon as possible. His prospects of rehabilitation are entirely connected with his being able to overcome his gambling addiction.
	
	
	In all other respects he presents to the Court as a person of good character. There are a number of excellent character references before the Court attesting to that. There is also material before the Court from his former employer indicating that he was a good worker and well liked within the workplace.
	
	
	He, as I have said, is the father of a three year old daughter. He and his partner have been together since they were teenagers. She gave evidence in these proceedings and I found her to be an impressive witness who viewed him honestly and without rose-coloured glasses. She is prepared to wait for him but has said that there will be an ultimatum on his release from custody that if he is not able to overcome his gambling addiction then she and their daughter will not be available for him. The fact that she remains available for him, and his strong ties to her and his daughter, it seems to me increases his prospects of rehabilitation but again they are entirely connected to his ability to overcome his gambling addictions.
	
	
	I accept from both the Liverpool Hospital records and also the report of Mr Watson-Munro that he was and probably still is depressed. It seems to me that that plays little part in the appropriate sentence for this offence however.
	
	
	He has demonstrated remorse and contrition that started with his immediate confession to police at the airport. It is indicated too by the assistance he provided to police in relation to the organiser of his trip to Thailand. He was prepared to participate in a controlled operation and the fact that it did not occur would appear to be as a result of operational considerations and not because of any reticence on his part. The assistance is of low value I accept from the certificate before me but, nonetheless, he provided it, was prepared to continue and that is a factor that I will take into account in assessing the overall sentence. It also, in part, is evidence to support his genuine remorse and contrition and further he has given evidence under oath to that effect.
	
	
	He pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity indicating a real willingness to facilitate the interests of justice. If it were necessary to quantify a discount for this Commonwealth offence it seems to me that a 25% discount would be appropriate. There should also be a smallish discount, if that were necessary, to take into account the assistance to which I have already referred.
	
	
	In terms of his other antecedents he is, as I have said, now 26. He came to live in Australia when he was, as I understand it, 12. He had lived in Thailand with his grandparents for a period before that. In all other respects I have already referred to those matters involving his character and antecedents.
	
	
	There is no hardship to the offender’s family which would properly reduce the sentence below that which is appropriate, but I accept that his partner and child will of course be adversely affected as a result of incarceration. She works but now has to shoulder the sole responsibility not only for the care of the child, but also for repayment of the mortgage. The child will also suffer from the absence of her father for the period that he remains in custody.
	
	
	He has been in custody bail refused since his arrest, that is, since 19 May 2013 and it is appropriate that the sentence be backdated to commence from then.
	
	
	Taking all of that into account, his role, the non-exculpatory duress, the involvement of his gambling addiction as a motivating factor and the fact of a prior good character, it seems to me that, absent any appropriate discount, a sentence of about 10 years would be called for. I am going to reduce the head sentence to seven years to take into account a substantial discount for the early plea of guilty, plus a smallish discount to reflect the assistance to authorities that he has given. I will be setting a non-parole period of four and a half years which, it seems to me, reflects the criminality involved. It allows for a significant period of supervision in the community so that he can continue to address his gambling addiction on release to parole. There are other special circumstances to reduce it below 75%, namely, that this is his first time in custody and he is a young man now still only 26.
	
	
	For those reasons then I make the following orders. He is convicted.
	
	
	He is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of seven years commencing on 19 May 2013 and expiring on 18 May 2020, with a non-parole period of four and a half years commencing on 19 May 2013 and expiring on 18 November 2017.

		25 August 2015",2014-02-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705465,Elliott v Tomkins [2014] NSWDC 55,"Judgment

1These are my reasons for dismissing the plaintiff's application for summary judgment and assessment of damages.

2The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation by statement of claim filed on 20 August 2013, pleading defamatory imputations arise from six Internet publications between 21 and 23 August 2012. These publications consist of a negative EBay review and subsequent discussion on Australian Bowhunting Forum of the defendant's problems with a business named ""Achilles Archery & Outdoors"".

3The plaintiff is not named in five of the six publications in question. His name appears in the fourth matter complained of, in that a letter signed by ""David Elliott"" is reproduced in the text of the publication. However, no particulars of identification are provided for any of the publications.

4Additionally, the particulars of publication are deficient. These particulars do not identify any publication in Australia, and consist merely of referring to ""the global internet accessibility and use of the EBay website"" (statement of claim, paragraph 21) and ""the global internet accessibility"" of the website upon which the third to sixth matters complained of were respectively published. Since the claim is based upon material allegedly posted on the Internet, the plaintiff must, in order to establish publication, set out particulars of when each of the matters complained of was downloaded from the web server: Dow Jones & Co Inc v Gutnick (2002) 210 CLR 575 at [25]-[28] and [44]; Jenman v McIntyre [2013] NSWSC 1100 at [3]. 

5Accordingly, it is not only necessary for the plaintiff, in order to establish publication, to prove that each matter complained of was downloaded and seen by at least one person, but that any such person was able to identify the plaintiff, as well as the means by which that person was able to identify the plaintiff. Those occasions must be within the twelve month period preceding the commencement of proceedings: Jenman v McIntyre, supra, at [4]. 

6Publication of each of the matters complained of also needs to be pleaded as having occurred in one or more of the States and Territories of Australia. The place of publication is of particular significance in the present case, where the statement of claim describes the plaintiff as a student residing in Queensland, and the defendant's place of residence is stated, correctly, to be in Western Australia. No connection with New South Wales has been identified and choice of forum issues may therefore also arise. 

7Notwithstanding these deficiencies of pleading, the plaintiff brings an application to strike out the defence filed on 13 November 2013, enter summary judgment, and have the proceedings listed for assessment of damages. A claim for special damages is pleaded, but particularised in a very general way.

8The circumstances in which the defence under challenge came to be filed are as follows. The proceedings had an uneventful history in the Defamation List, starting with a first directions hearing on 11 October 2013 (when the matter was stood over to 25 October 2013, with the plaintiff's solicitor to inform the defendant of the date at the next directions hearing, the defendant being unrepresented), and a timetable for the filing of a defence on 25 October 2013. The defendant was also directed to give the plaintiff notice of any applications to transfer the matter out of New South Wales by 8 November 2013. A defence was filed on 13 November 2013, two days before the directions hearing on 15 November 2013. On 15 November 2013, these proceedings were listed before me, and the plaintiff made his application for summary judgment under UCPR r 14.28 without, it would appear, any or any sufficient prior notice to the defendant, who was self-represented at all relevant times up until today. 

9The defence filed on 13 November 2013 is a discursive document, containing a history of events and attaching documents. It fails to identify proper defences under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW). Despite these deficiencies, it is clear the defendant is attempting to plead a defence of justification. As the defendant (who had never appeared in court in person) was unrepresented, I stood the plaintiff's application over to 30 January 2014, directing the plaintiff to write to the defendant identifying defences under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) and directing the provision of an amended defence failing which the application to strike out the defence will proceed. This resulted in a draft defence which correctly identified s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) but still consisted of a long narrative of facts, rather than pleadings, and in unacceptable form.

10The defendant appeared by telephone link on 30 January 2014. He explained to the court that, while he resided in Perth, Western Australia, he spent much of the year working in remote parts of Western Australia and he had not had the opportunity to obtain legal advice. In the interim, he had provided a draft amended defence, attempting to plead justification under s 25 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), both to the solicitor for the plaintiff and to the court. He proposed to seek legal advice and sought an extension of time to file an amended defence on or before Monday 24 February 2014. Arrangements were made for him to appear by way of telephone today in the event that he was unable to obtain legal advice, but he then advised my associate that he had retained a solicitor instead. The plaintiff's summary judgment application was stood over to today as well.

11When the matter came before me today, Mr Goldsmith appeared on behalf of the defendant. He indicated he had not yet had time to prepare a defence, but that an amended defence would be filed pleading justification, and other defences. Mr Goldsmith pointed out that no defence could be filed until the plaintiff amended the statement of claim to plead identification and publication, after which time the defendant could also consider whether the proceedings should be transferred to Western Australia.

12Despite Mr Goldsmith enumerating the flaws in the statement of claim to which I have adverted, and tendering correspondence to the plaintiff's solicitors in which he had pointed out these and other pleadings failings, Ms Nguyen informed me she was instructed to press her application to strike out the defence and enter summary judgment. Ms Nguyen submitted that even if an amended statement of claim needed to be filed, her client was still entitled to summary judgment. Ms Nguyen answered the objections raised by Mr Goldsmith by stating, from the bar table, that the plaintiff also resides in New South Wales, and that damage to reputation occurred in New South Wales.

13The power to strike out a pleading and enter judgment should be exercised only in plain and obvious cases. If the pleading can be cured by amendment, leave to amend should be granted rather than exercising the power to strike out. This is particularly the case where the party in question is a litigant in person: Mann v Cahill (1999) 149 FLR 298. The overriding purpose in s 56(1) Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) is for the court to give directions aimed at achieving ""just, quick and cheap"" resolution of a dispute. Where a pleading contains embarrassing or prolix material, even if it does contain material factual allegations sufficient to constitute a cause of action, it may still be struck out (Northam v Favelle Favco Holdings Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Bryson J, 7 March 1995)). However, this will not result in summary judgment where there is sufficient evidence to establish that the pleading does not reveal a hopeless case or some other bar to the granting of leave to amend, such as fraud or dishonesty. In particular, summary judgment cannot be granted where the claim brought on behalf of the plaintiff is to inadequately pleaded.

14The draft defence provided by the defendant pleading justification, while infelicitously drafted, is nevertheless sufficiently particularised to survive an application for summary judgment. The defects in the plaintiff's statement of claim, by comparison, fails to plead adequately the particulars of identification relied upon (which can have fatal consequences for a plaintiff: see Lazarus v Deutsche Lufthansa AG (1985) 1 NSWLR 188) or publication. Given the inadequacy of the statement of claim, the defendant arguably has a better case for summary judgment than does the plaintiff.

15The facts in this case, and the application brought by the plaintiff, highlight significant problems in the case management of defamation proceedings. One of the results of electronic publication and the Internet is that anyone (or perhaps I should say everyone) can be a publisher. In the past, defamation proceedings were mainly conducted against media or professional publishers, who had access to skilled legal advice, both for pre-publication and post-publication issues. Ordinary members of the community do not have these resources. Few understand that they can be sued for defamation for a complaint, or use of critical language, because these statements are now not only electronically recorded but available to a wide audience through the Internet. Still fewer understand that even while the publication may eventually be determined by the court to be excused, protected or justified by law, they will have to undertake the expense of defending the action all the way to trial because summary disposal procedures under Australian law are limited to the striking out of pleadings which fail to comply with defamation pleading rules, which rules some judges have compared, unfavourably, to the technicalities of the minuet (Setka v Abbott [2913] VSC 726 at [31] per Beach JA; Burrows v Knightley (1987) 10 NSWLR 651 at 654 per Hunt J; Lucas v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2000] NSWSC 950 at [40] - [41] per Levine J; cf Jecks v Taylor (Supreme Court of Western Australia, 9 November 1992) at 12 per Hawkins M, preferring ""sarabande""). In addition, the degree to which courts should take a proactive approach in defamation proceedings where litigants in person find themselves in this position may present difficulties, given the limited role of the judge in the common law system: Sporting Shooters Association of Australia v Judge (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1821. There are no simple answers to these increasingly common problems.

16I have reserved the issue of costs pending receipt of amended pleadings from both the plaintiff and defendant. I note the intention of the defendant, once proper particulars of publication are provided, to give notice of any application to transfer these proceedings out of New South Wales. The matter will be returned to the Defamation List for further case management once both parties have put their pleadings in order.

Orders

(1)Dismiss the application of the plaintiff to strike out the defence in these proceedings pursuant to r 14.28 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) and have summary judgment entered.

(2)Direct the plaintiff to file and serve an amended statement of claim in 14 days.

(3)On or before 14 March 2014, the plaintiff provide to the defendant particulars of all facts, matters and circumstances upon which he relies in support of any claim that these proceedings should properly be heard and determined in this Court.

(4)Defendant to file and serve a defence by Thursday 27 March 2014.

(5)Matter stood over for further directions on Friday 28 March 2014 at 10:00am before Gibson DCJ to monitor compliance with these orders and to make appropriate costs orders.

(6)Costs of today reserved.

2705467,R v Cupples [2014] NSWDC 42,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: On 22 November I dealt with Jonathan Cupples. He appeared for sentence on two matters under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. On that day I set out the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective material and indicated that it was likely that a sentence of two years or less would be imposed and I referred Mr Cupples for an assessment as to his suitability to serve that sentence by way of an intensive corrections order. That assessment was done, it indicates his suitability to serve a sentence in that manner.

2Mr Healey, today submits that I would suspend any sentence of imprisonment imposed upon his client. I do not propose to do that. The offences were serious, and Mr Cupples requires punishment, more punishment that is occasioned by the imposition of a suspended sentence of imprisonment. There also needs to be a substantial component of general deterrence. Again, a suspended sentence would be insufficient in that regard. Accordingly, I make the following order:

3In each case the offender is sentenced to concurrent sentences of imprisonment of two years. They are to be served by way of an intensive corrections order. They will commence on 10 March 2014. The intensive corrections orders will be subject to the mandatory conditions prescribed by cl 175 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation. A copy of the conditions will be provided to the offender at the registry.

2705471,Kuehne v R [2014] NSWCCA 22,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2ADAMS J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  On 7 August 2009, after a three day trial before her Honour Judge English and a jury in the District Court at Penrith, the appellant was convicted of one count of break, enter and commit serious indictable offence in circumstances of aggravation (being in company) contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  Such an offence has a prescribed maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 5 years.
4On 27 November 2009 the appellant was sentenced to 6 years 8 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years to date from 3 December 2008.
5The applicant appealed against his conviction and sentence.  On 4 May 2011, this Court dismissed both appeals:  Kuehne v R [2011] NSWCCA 101.  The sentence appeal did not raise a ground, as is now sought to be raised, concerning the misapplication of the standard non-parole period legislation.  That was because the appeal predated the clarification of the correct approach to that legislation set out in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.
6The applicant then sought a review of his sentence pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).  On 19 November 2013 Latham J referred that sentence to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW):  Application by Walter James Kuehne pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1537.  It has been recently clarified that in such a case there is no requirement for leave to appeal, or for an extension of time, at least in respect of grounds the subject of the referral: Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14 at [38]-[39]. 
7The applicant was released to parole on 13 December 2013.  His parole period will expire on 2 August 2015.
Facts
8A summary of the facts of the appellant's offence was provided in the sentencing judgment of English DCJ:
""In the early hours of the morning of 17 November 2007 Mr Chay went to work at the bakery in Bolderwood Road Blackett.  He drove into the backyard, parked his vehicle and unlocked the back door.  It was a security steel door made of bars and then a flyscreen door; there was then another door to enter, a wooden door.  He entered the bakery and commenced mixing flour to make the dough.  He heard a noise as though someone was trying to shake the back gate.  He went out to investigate and saw three men standing near the back gate on the outside of his yard.  He saw them run to the gate at the butcher shop next door and go in through that gate.  They picked up a chair and kicked the fence between the two yards.  They threw a long steel pole at [him].  He saw one of the men, a tall man, had a knife in his hand.  
He ran back inside the shop and tried to lock the steel door, one of the men tried to push the pole through the door at him.  He pulled the flyscreen door shut and put a piece of wood across the door to hold it shut.  One of the men kicked the bottom of the flyscreen door.  He ran inside and closed the wooden door.  It was kicked in.  He ran into the storeroom, closed the door and dialled triple-0.  He heard the storeroom door being kicked in but it did not break.
Things then went quiet.  He looked out and he saw one man pulling the cash register from the wall [and] the other two standing near the refrigerators in the shop.  They ran past him with the cash register and left the shop via the back door.  He grabbed a broom and chased them.  He saw the fence between the two yards had been broken and the gate to the butcher shop was open.  He ran through the break in the fence and saw the three men leaving the scene in a small silver hatchback motor vehicle.  He could not identify any of the three men.  Police attended and located fingerprints on the top of the fence between the two yards.  They were identified as the fingerprints of this offender.""
Personal circumstances of the appellant
9A summary of certain aspects of the appellant's subjective circumstances was provided in the judgment of Hislop J at [31]-[32]:
""The appellant was born in 1981.  He had a difficult early life.  He completed year 12 at high school.  He has drug and alcohol problems.  His criminal record comprises convictions for goods in custody, driving offences, custody of an offensive implement in a public place, possessing housebreaking implements, assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company as well as nine convictions for break enter and steal and a conviction for aggravated break and enter.  He has incurred institutional misconduct charges.  The subject offence occurred whilst he was on parole.
Her Honour stated in her remarks on sentence:
'He has of course been afforded considerable opportunity and support in the past.  Any leniency extended to him in the past has been ignored and he has breached orders of the court put in place to assist him.  In August 2000 he was ordered to perform 300 hours of community service work and was placed on a two year good behaviour bond.  His responses were poor, he failed to complete the community service order and was sentenced to periodic detention.  He failed to respond and attend alcohol and other drug programmes in accordance with the conditions of his good behaviour bond.  He continued to re-offend.  He failed to comply with an order for periodic detention and that was revoked and he was sentenced to full time custody.  He re-offended whilst on that parole.  He was again incarcerated and on the next occasion released to unsupervised parole and he reoffended.  In June 2004 he was referred to the Parramatta Drug Court program.  By his own admission, he had no intention of complying with the requirements of the program and he left the residential rehabilitation facility on the first night.  Upon his release in August 2007 [he], by his own admission, was abusing alcohol and heavily to prevent from relapsing into drug use.  He was also using crystal methamphetamine.'""
10Hislop J later (at [44]) referred to some further matters:
""Her Honour described the appellant as 'the most unimpressive witness and his version of events could best be said to be imaginative to the point of being beyond belief.'  She said he 'has no doubt told courts on many prior occasions of his intentions in that regard [as to rehabilitation] and he has breached the trust imposed in him by those courts and he has not complied with the orders or the assistance offered to him.'  The appellant was neither remorseful nor contrite.  Her Honour considered his prospects of rehabilitation as quite poor given his past failed attempts and despite what he might now say about his intentions for the future.""
11The sentencing judge accepted the opinion of a psychologist that the appellant was of ""low cognitive functioning and socially unsophisticated, someone lacking in reflective capacity"".  His verbal and non-verbal intelligence were assessed as falling into the borderline and average ranges respectively. 
12The ""difficult early life"" referred to by Hislop J was a reference to the applicant being one of six siblings and being brought up in an environment marred by domestic violence and his parents' abuse of alcohol and drugs.  His parents separated when he was aged  about seven and he remained in the care of his father.  He commenced using alcohol and cannabis at age 12 and amphetamines at about age 17; his mother injecting this drug for him the first time.  His father has remained supportive of him, although he would not visit him in gaol.  He had little or no contact with his mother.
13Despite his lengthy history of substance abuse, the appellant gave evidence before the sentencing judge professing a motivation to finally make a genuine attempt at rehabilitation.  Her Honour, with justification given the history, was unimpressed.
The previous appeal
14Three issues were raised in the appeal against sentence in the original appeal.  The first matter concerned an issue of totality given that the sentence imposed by English DCJ was entirely accumulated upon sentences for unrelated offences the appellant had served in the year or so following his arrest for the present matter.  It was contended that the appellant had become institutionalised given that he had spent a considerable proportion of the time since November 2001 in custody.  Finally it was contended that the applicant had been held in protective custody, albeit at his own request in relation to unrelated matters, whilst on remand.  It was anticipated that he would continue to be on protection after sentencing.  It was submitted before the sentencing judge that by reason of these three factors there should also be a finding of special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  
15Hislop J dealt with each of these contentions (at [33]-[52]) and found no error in the approach taken by the sentencing judge.  He also concluded that no lesser sentence was warranted and should have been passed:  s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  McColl JA and R S Hulme J agreed.
Ground of appeal - The sentencing judge erred in the application of the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principle identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120
16It was common ground that this ground should be upheld.  The reasoning of the primary judge that is relevant in this respect was summarised by Latham J in the course of her referral reasons (at [8]):
""The sentencing judge found the offence to be 'at the mid range of objective seriousness' and that there was 'no good reason to depart from that guideline, benchmark or guidepost.'  It is clear that the judge therefore engaged in a two-stage sentencing process.""
17There is no doubt that such an approach to sentencing was subsequently held by the High Court to be erroneous:  Muldrock at [28].  The Crown, however, contended that no lesser sentence was warranted.
Is a lesser sentence warranted?
18Matters relevant to the assessment of the s 6(3) issue include the following matters that represented the state of affairs as they existed at the time of sentencing:
· The unchallenged finding by the sentencing judge that the offence was ""at the mid range of objective seriousness"".  Part of this assessment was influenced by the presence of objective aggravating factors: the use of a weapon (a long steel pole which was thrown at the victim and one offender held a knife); the vulnerability of the victim (who was forced to flee and lock himself in the storeroom); and the damage occasioned to the premises.  On the other hand, the judge took into account that the victim did not appear to have suffered substantial ongoing harm and that the proceeds of the offence were not significant.
· The appellant was in the community under conditional liberty (parole) at the time of the offence: s 21A(2)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
· The appellant was aged 26 at the time of the offence and 27 at the time of sentence.
· The acceptance by the sentencing judge of evidence of the appellant's background referred to above, particularly as to his exposure to violence, alcohol and drugs at a young age.
· The absence of reasons to extend leniency, there being no plea of guilty, remorse, or good prospects of rehabilitation.  The appellant's significant criminal history also denied to him the extension of leniency.
19In addition, it is necessary for this Court to have regard to further material that was received by way of affidavits sworn by the appellant and his solicitor.  The appellant was released on parole on 13 December 2013.  He has involved himself with his family.  After initially living in a ""therapeutic drug rehabilitation residence"", he is now living with his sister and keeps busy by helping her with the care of her three children.  His brother is attempting to assist him in obtaining employment.  He claims to now be free of alcohol and illegal drugs.  He was on a methadone program when he went into custody in December 2007 but reduced the dosage to the point of ceasing that program in January 2012.  
20Prior to his release from custody he undertook a variety of drug rehabilitation programs and he attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings (and he has continued doing so in the community).  He also completed a variety of vocational courses, including acquiring a forklift driver's licence.  He engaged in a work release program for a considerable period and was commended for his work ethic.
Conclusion
21The applicant's progress towards rehabilitation appears to be encouraging.  The evidence indicates a far greater level of maturity and insight into the causes of his offending behaviour that bodes well for his future.  As the appellant's counsel, Mr Smith, put it in his customary direct and concise way, ""this is someone who has had a real decent go"" and ""it is a significant distinguishing feature between him now and him as at the time of sentence"".
22That said, however, sight must not be lost of the fact that the applicant committed an offence of significant seriousness with the additional aggravating factor that he was on parole at the time.  
23While neither the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years nor the standard non-parole period of 5 years can have determinative significance, they remain relevant as the High Court observed in Muldrock (at [27]) as two ""legislative guideposts"". 
24Taking into account all of the facts concerning the offending with the various personal circumstances of the appellant, but particularly having regard to the positive evidence that is now available as to his progress towards rehabilitation, I am of the view that a lesser sentence is appropriate. 
25The question as to whether there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) would ordinarily be engaged but with the appellant already being on parole there is no utility in dwelling upon it.
Order
26I propose the following orders:
1. Appeal against sentence allowed.
2. Quash the sentence imposed by English DCJ on 27 November 2009.
3. In lieu thereof, sentence the appellant to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 6 months.  The sentence is to date from 3 December 2008.  The non-parole period expired on 2 June 2013 and the total term will expire on 2 December 2014.

2705477,Police v Poolman [2014] NSWLC 3,"Judgment

Remarks on sentence
1The offender, Daniel Tai Poolman, stands for sentence having entered pleas of guilty on 22 October 2013 to the following charges -




Seq. No.

Date

Offence


1.

2/6/2013

Assault occasioning actual bodily harm
Section 59(1), Crimes Act 1900


4.

2/6/2013

Intimidation
Section 13(1), Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007


5.

2/6/2013

Assault
Section 61, Crimes Act 1900


6.

2/6/2013

Damage property
Section 195(1)(a), Crimes Act 1900

2It will be readily apparent that sequences 2 and 3 were withdrawn on an earlier occasion arising out of 'charge negotiations' with the prosecuting authorities. Initially, pleas of not guilty were entered to all charges and a brief service order made. This is of more than academic interest because pleas of guilty arising out of successful negotiations have quite a bearing on any available discount: see R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56 at [11]. 

3A conviction upon indictment for assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to section 59 and damaging property contrary to section 195(1)(a) carries a penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. Common assault contrary to section 61 carries a penalty of imprisonment for 2 years. An offence of intimidation contrary to section 13(1) also carries a penalty of imprisonment for 5 years with the addition of a fine of $5,500 or both fine and imprisonment. Section 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 restricts the length of imprisonment the Local Court may impose to one of 2 years in each case and/or a fine of up to $5,500. 

4I refer to the potential penalties to make clear the objective seriousness of the offences. These mirror the legislative intention of the Parliament to which sentencing courts (even District Courts hearing appeals from the Local Court) must pay strict regard.

Salient facts
5As is usual in the Local Court a statement of agreed facts signed by the offender and his solicitor was tendered to the Court and is Exhibit 1. Also tendered as Exhibit 2 is a bail report showing the offender has no criminal antecedents. I will set out my own brief summary of the facts. The complainant, Kylie Anne Whicker, resides at an address in Grenfell with her three children aged 13, 12 and 9 years. She suffers from a number of health problems and a spinal disease. She is semi-invalid and uses a wheelchair to get around. Her son and a daughter both suffer autism. 

6The complainant and the offender have been in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years. On 1 June 2013 the offender stayed the night at the complainant's house. About 10.00am on Sunday, the complainant was woken by her 9 year old daughter as she wanted to be with her mother. The complainant agreed and indicated she was in a bit of pain and to just let her get out of bed. In so doing she made a noise waking the offender. He got out of bed in a huff and started throwing the blankets around before going to the toilet. He said, ""This is not fucking fair. It's Sunday and parents should be allowed to sleep and not be woken by children. Kids should be able to amuse themselves."" The complainant asked him to leave the house as he was continually screaming.

7The offender picked up the 9 year old girl and took her into a bedroom. The complainant told him to put her down. He said, ""I have had fucking enough."" He walked to the complainant and placed his open hand around her throat and pushed her neck backwards, pushing her off the chair on which she had been sitting.

8The daughter yelled out to the offender asking him not to hurt her mother. He replied, ""I am not hurting her, shut your fucking mouth"". The complainant said, ""Don't speak to her like that."" The offender picked up the child and put her in her bedroom. He then pushed the complainant and picked her up around the throat region before pushing her onto the bed. The 9 year old entered the room and said, ""Do not do that to my mummy"". The offender stopped and started yelling at the child. 

9The complainant shoved the offender and was pushed to the ground for her trouble. She felt pain to her eye. The offender grabbed her hair in a pulling motion. He continued to verbally abuse her. He next grabbed her throat and placed his open hand up around her nose region. He threatened to break her nose. She was kneed to the face resulting in bruising to her right eye. She was by this time on the ground. The offender picked her up and threw her onto her daughter's bed in the presence of the children. He got on top of her and pushed down on her chest causing pain to her rib area. The eldest daughter covered her sister's face with her hands and put headphones over her ears so she could not see or hear what was occurring. The offender got off the bed, walked into the lounge room and left via the back gate. 

10Some time later the offender returned to the house to retrieve his mobile phone battery. The front door was closed and he commenced banging on the door and window and yelling. The front window of the house was thus damaged. The complainant opened the door and the offender slapped her across the face as he walked past. Quite apart from the violence involved, I have no doubt it was intended to both insult and demean the complainant. He went to find his battery and during the process threatened to burn down the complainant's house.

11As a consequence of the assaults upon her by the offender, the complainant was taken to Orange Base Hospital where, upon examination, she was found to be suffering from a broken nose, several broken ribs and a swollen and blackened eye. 

12Police spoke to the offender the next day. He admitted to pushing the complainant and pulling her hair and agreed his yelling would have scared the complainant and her children. He also admitted to leaving the house in the complainant's car with her wheelchair in the boot. He did not explain how the complainant received her injuries.

Pre sentence report
13The Court has the benefit of a report from Ms Capes of the Young Community Corrections Office dated 21 November 2013 that is now Exhibit 3. The offender reported a somewhat unsettled childhood but overall said he had a good upbringing free from major dysfunction and disturbance. He claimed that throughout the period of over three years he solely provided all the personal care the complainant required due to her medical condition. He is currently on unemployment benefits although had previously been in receipt of a carer's benefit while providing for the complainant.

14The offender acknowledged his need to address anger management. He indicated he had anger issues. During the adjournment he was referred to a general practitioner and a private psychologist, however, at the time of writing the report he had not made contact with the general practitioner as requested. He said he disagreed with the facts as read to him at interview. He agreed to the ""yelling and screaming"" and that he ""pushed and pulled"" the complainant. He said he ""just snapped"" at the events as they occurred that morning. 

15When asked about the effect upon the complainant of the offences he appeared to have limited insight about the impact his actions had on the complainant. He appeared to minimise responsibility for his offences by blaming the complainant for the injuries received during the event. He has been assessed as a medium/low risk of re-offending. 

16The offender said the one major relationship in his life was with the complainant but this had ended as a result of the present matters. I do not know if that is still correct judging by the noisy and disruptive conduct of the complainant in support of the offender both inside and outside the Court on the last occasion. Perhaps there has been a reconciliation to restore what passes for harmony in the relationship. Whether that is the case or not, what follows is out of the complainant's hands. When viewed through the eyes of the participants the nature of the offence could perhaps be seen as merely a private matter. The Court, however, cannot (and will not) take that view: see R v Yin (unreported, NSW CCA, 9 November 1988); Shaw v R [2008] NSWCCA 58 at [27]; R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 173 at [28]; Rowe v R (1996) 89 A Crim R 467 at 472-473; R v Berry [2000] NSWCCA 451 at [32]. 

17The offender is assessed as suitable for a Community Service Order and would benefit by a period of supervision by Community Corrections with referral to a medical practitioner and psychologist to access anger management counselling.

Defence submissions
18Mr Barron, solicitor, has said all that could possibly be said on behalf of the offender. In essence, he submits I would have due regard to his lack of prior criminal antecedents. Mr Barron submits the offender must have some insight into his behaviour as he is now seeing a clinical psychologist in Cowra for anger management. He has been placed on prescribed medication. Mr Barron advised the Court that the relationship is now over.

19It was submitted that I deal with the charges by way of a non-custodial sentence - preferably under section 12. Alternately, I should find special circumstances as this will be his first time in custody.

Matters of general principle
Objective seriousness
20The correct starting point is a level-headed assessment of the gravity of the objective facts of the offences with which the Court is dealing. There can be no doubting the objective seriousness of these offences - if only by reference to the penalties provided by Parliament. See also the decision of R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354. 

Plea of guilty
21The offender initially entered pleas of not guilty to all charges and a brief service order was made. Negotiated pleas as to charges and facts were entered on 22 October 2013 and adjourned for sentence until 3 December 2013 and ultimately to today. I remind myself of the judgment of Howie J in R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56 at [11] and will allow a pragmatic discount for the utilitarian value of the plea at 15%. There is a further allowance to be made of 3 days pre-sentence custody.

Domestic violence offences
22I have said this before but it is worth one more repetition. It is sad testimony indeed to the state of our society that instances of domestic violence, and serious domestic violence at that, continue unabated. It does not seem to matter what resources are employed to protect women (and it is almost always women) from violence in a domestic context. 

23It is important, yet again, to stress the need for personal and general deterrence and denunciation in cases of domestic violence which inherently involve breaches of trust and vulnerability of victims. The people of the township of Young, supported by The Young Witness, showed strong support in a recent public campaign of awareness against domestic violence which condemned such conduct. They recognise that domestic violence is a crime against both the victim and the community.

24The complainant in this case was particularly vulnerable due to her physical incapacity and the offender was well aware of this. She was largely, if not entirely, defenceless. And she received her injuries in the presence of her children and in her own home (which are aggravating features in themselves: see Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210; Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214). In the circumstances the offender's conduct was cowardly and, quite frankly, beneath contempt.

25It is worthwhile taking a little time to re-state what courts of higher and binding authority have said, time and again, as to what is required of subordinate courts in dealing with these cases.

26In approaching the resolution of sentencing in domestic violence cases, courts have made numerous statements about the importance of general deterrence. In R v Glen (unreported, NSW CCA, 19 December 1994), Simpson J stressed the importance of general deterrence in cases of domestic violence. Her Honour stated that victims of domestic violence will ""receive the full protection of the law, insofar as the courts are able to afford it to them"". (See also R v Greene [2001] NSWCCA 258 per Howie J - ""general deterrence was a significant matter in sentencing the applicant simply because of the prevalence of violence by men against women in domestic relationships"".) In R v Berry [2000] NSWCCA 451 the Court recognised that there was a need for ""both general and personal deterrence in sentencing for a crime of domestic violence."" 

27In the landmark case of R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302, (2006) 164 A Crim R 179, in the leading judgment of Justice Johnson, the Court noted that the importance of general deterrence in domestic violence cases, given the prevalence of violence by men against women in domestic relationships, had been emphasised repeatedly by the Court and the following passages were cited in support at [69]-[72]:

In R v Ross (Court of Criminal Appeal, 20 November 1996, unreported), Adams AJ (Newman J agreeing) observed, in the context of a sentence appeal concerning an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed upon a domestic partner:
""This was an act of frightening violence meted out to a woman [who] was entitled to the protection of the law. Until men such as the applicant understand that the law will treat with real seriousness cases which hitherto have been dismissed as having 'domestic' significance, this appalling series of violent acts meted out continuously to women in this community by men who suppose they have the right to do so will not stop.""

In R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267, Simpson J (Studdert J agreeing) said at paragraph 26: 
""Domestic violence is a problem of considerable proportions in this community and the courts must be strong to ensure that it is adequately punished.""

In R v Edigarov (2001) 125 A Crim R 551, Wood CJ at CL (Studdert and Bell JJ agreeing) said at 558 [41]: 
""As this Court has confirmed in Glen NSWCCA 19 December 1994, Ross NSWCCA 20 November 1996, Rowe (1996) 89 A Crim R 467, Fahda (1999) NSWCCA 267 and Powell (2000) NSWCCA 108, violent attacks in domestic settings must be treated with real seriousness. Regrettably, that form of conduct involves aggression by men who are physically stronger than their victims and who are often in a position economically, or otherwise, to enforce their silence and their acceptance of such conduct. In truth such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the Courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished, and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.""

In R v Dunn (2004) 144 A Crim R 180, Adams J (Ipp JA and Sully J agreeing) said at 195 [47]: 
""Crimes involving domestic violence have two important characteristics which differentiate them from many other crimes of violence: firstly, the offender usually believes that, in a real sense, what they do is justified, even that they are the true victim; and, secondly, the continued estrangement requires continued threat. These elements also usually mean that the victim never feels truly safe. Unlike the casual robbery, where the victim is often simply in the wrong place at the wrong time, the victim of a domestic violence offence is personally targeted. To my mind these considerations emphasise not only the need for general and personal deterrence but also of denunciation in cases of this kind.""

28In Hamid the Court also said at [86]:

In sentencing a domestic violence offender, and in particular a repeat domestic violence offender, specific and general deterrence are important factors, together with the requirement of powerful denunciation by the community of such conduct and the need for protection of the community. Recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community as a result of crimes of domestic violence is important. These principles flow from statements of this Court and are fortified by the enactment of Division 1A of Part 15A of the Crimes Act 1900 including the statutory objects recited in s.562AC.

29The Court also referred to criminological research, stating at [77]:

An adequate account of domestic violence should recognise that it typically involves the exercise of power and control over the victim, is commonly recurrent, may escalate over time, may affect a number of people beyond the primary target (including children, other family members and supporters of the victim) and that it contributes to the subordination of women; domestic violence typically involves the violation of trust by someone with whom the victim shares, or has shared, an intimate relationship; the offender may no longer need to resort to violence in order to instil fear and control.

30More recently in Vragovic v R [2007] NSWCCA 46 the Court observed at [33]:

It was once thought in some circles that domestic violence was somehow less serious than criminal violence inflicted in other circumstances. I do not agree. In many cases of domestic violence a distinguishing characteristic is the notion of the offender that he (and it is almost invariably a male) is entitled to act as he did pursuant to some perverted view of the rights of a male over a female with whom he is or was intimately connected. It is this characteristic of self-justification which requires particular emphasis to be given, in cases of this kind, to the elements of general and personal deterrence...

31Similar views have been expressed in other Australian jurisdictions with respect to sentencing of domestic violence offenders. (See, for example, R v Devine (unreported, Supreme Court of Tasmania, 5 July 1993); Gallegos v R [1999] WASCA 191; Ugle v R [2001] WASCA 268; Attorney-General for Tasmania v O [2004] TASSC 53.)

32Given that weight of judicial authority, it is abundantly clear that there is a serious obligation upon courts called upon to deal with cases of domestic violence to impose condign punishment in appropriate cases. The message needs be spread, and firmly, throughout the community, that that is precisely what will happen. The aspects of personal and general deterrence were stressed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Hiron v R [2007] NSWCCA 336 and called for deterrent sentences to be imposed.

33What, then, is to be done with an offender who assaulted his domestic companion in her own home by breaking her nose, breaking her ribs and kneeing her in the face causing injury to an eye as well as slapping her across the face? And in the immediate presence of two of her children? While it is always possible to conjure up a ""worse case"" - I assess the AOABH charge at the upper end of the middle range of the scale of offending. I assess the criminality of the remaining charges at below the middle range of the scale of offending.

34It is worthwhile reinforcing the point about the presence of the children at the relevant time. A study by the Australian Institute of Criminology found that young people growing up in homes where there has been couple violence, that is, both male and female carers perpetrating and being victimised by domestic violence, were more likely to be victims of relationship violence and perpetrators of violence in their own intimate relationships. 

Remorse as a factor
35Section 21A(2)(i) was amended by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment Act 2007, which commenced on proclamation on 1 January 2008. Where the new section applies, as it does here, remorse will only be relevant as a mitigating factor where the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both): see section 21A(3)(i). 

36This does not place any requirement upon an offender to enter the witness box and provide sworn evidence. I am able to take into account an expression of remorse from, for example, a Pre Sentence Report. Hereunder is an extract from the report, Exhibit 3 (p 2): 

When asked about the effect upon the victim of the offences, he appeared to have limited insight. Mr Poolman appeared to minimize responsibility for his offences by blaming the victim for the injuries received during the event.

37There is really nothing in the report as to anything remotely resembling remorse. Expressions of remorse heard for the first time today from the bar table are too little, too late. I am not prepared to accord him an acknowledgement that he is remorseful for his actions in any acceptable sense.

38I am obliged to give proper regard to sections 3A and 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It is inappropriate to impose any sentence of imprisonment unless I come to the conclusion that imprisonment, and no other sentence, is appropriate. In the matters presently under consideration, I am very firmly of the opinion that no sentences other than sentences of full-time imprisonment are appropriate. 

39In arriving at that conclusion I have regard to the nature of the offences committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general and specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. Taken together, I am of the view that this is not an appropriate case for a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. It follows from what I have just said that it is not appropriate for the sentences to be suspended: R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17; Blundell v R [2008] NSWCCA 92 per Simpson J.

40I must give proper effect to the principles enunciated by the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ (emphasis added): 

A judge sentencing an offender for more than one offence must fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence, as well, of course, as questions of totality.

41There will be some partial cumulation of the sentences: see Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14. There is no rule that sentences committed on the same day or in the same criminal enterprise should be served concurrently. The issue has been considered in a number of decisions of superior courts making it plain that the question to be asked is whether the criminality of one offence can be encompassed in the criminality of the other offence; see generally R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272. The position was further explained in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1. See also R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; (2009) 195 A Crim R 38 at [52].

Penalties
42For the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm the offender is convicted and sentenced to an original term of imprisonment of 12 months. I apply a discount of 15% resulting in an actual term of 10 months and 6 days, however, in conformity with the decision in Rios v R [2012] NSWCCA 8, per Adamson J (Bathurst CJ and Simpson J agreeing) at [43], I will pragmatically round down the sentence in favour of the offender to one of 10 months. There will be a non-parole period of 3 months originally to commence on 18 February 2014, but backdated by 3 days commencing on 15 February 2014 and eligible for parole on 14 May 2014. There will be a balance of term of 7 months commencing on 15 May 2014 and expiring on 14 December 2014.

43Pursuant to section 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I direct the release of the offender to parole at the end of the non-parole period provided he is otherwise eligible. Pursuant to section 51 I direct as a condition of parole that the offender be subject to supervision by the Probation & Parole Service for such period as that Service deems necessary and undertake any programme or treatment recommended by the Service. Any failure to comply with this direction may be regarded as a breach of parole.

44For the charge of common assault the offender is convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of 3 months to date from 15 March 2014 expiring on 14 June 2014. The sentence is for a fixed term because it is subsumed in the earlier sentence imposed.

45I am prepared to find ""special circumstances"" owing to the offender's age, the need for supervision upon release, this will be his first time in custody and because there is some partial cumulation of penalty.

46For the charges of intimidation and damage property the offender is convicted and ordered to enter into bonds pursuant to section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 for a period of 12 months conditioned that he (1) be of good behaviour and appear before the Court if called upon to do so at any time during the currency of the bonds and (2) notify the Registrar of this Court of any change in residential address during the currency of the bonds.

47I make final orders in the Apprehended Domestic Violence Order Application in terms of 1, 4, 5 and 11 for a period of 2 years from today. 18 February 2014. The complainant's three children are to be added as protected persons. Given the facts of this case, they too are entitled to be considered and protected. The distance specified in order 4 is now 50 metres in lieu of the original 100 metres.

48Someone unfamiliar with the more commonplace anti-social dynamics of this community and responding, no doubt, to a case not put before me, might be persuaded to release the offender on appeal or reduce the sentence. Be that as it may.

49For my part, however, I will continue to apply the principles of binding authority which the higher courts have made plain are required in sentencing for offences of this type as well as according with legitimate community expectations. Until this message is spread and applied consistently at all levels of the justice system more women will continue to be assaulted and perpetrators will continue to thumb their nose at the law by evading their just desserts.

		24 March 2014",2014-02-17 00:00:00,NSW Local Court
2705482,R v McKellar (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 106,"EX Tempore Judgment
1An application has been made by senior counsel for the accused for a verdict by direction with regard to count three on the indictment.  That count alleges, in short, an offence of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The Crown opened on the basis that I, as the tribunal of fact, may also need to consider the statutory alternative, the offence contained in s 193B(3).  The subsections are as follows:
193B   Money laundering
...
(2)  A person who deals with proceeds of crime knowing that it is proceeds of crime is guilty of an offence. 
Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 15 years.
(3)  A person who deals with proceeds of crime being reckless as to whether it is proceeds of crime is guilty of an offence. 
Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years.
2Senior counsel for the accused has submitted, in short, that there is no evidence of a number of essential elements of the offence.  She has submitted, first, that there is a high mental element attaching to both the primary offence and the alternative offence and, in truth, nothing has been placed before the Court to disprove what the accused said in his recorded interview with regard to the sum of $6057.80 cash found on his person.
3She also submitted that in truth there is no evidence that that cash was proceeds of crime, as defined in s 193A of the Crimes Act (NSW), which states that:
proceeds of crime means any property that is substantially derived or realised, directly or indirectly, by any person from the commission of a serious offence. 

4I mean no disrespect to learned senior counsel by dealing with those submissions rather succinctly, and simply stating that to my mind there is a strong circumstantial case that that cash was derived from some sort of criminality.  I also consider that it cannot be said that there should be a verdict by direction on the basis that there is simply no evidence either of knowledge on the part of the accused, or of recklessness on his part.  Accordingly, I decline to order a verdict by direction on either of those two bases.
5Senior counsel has made a third submission, however, that pertains to the degree of particularity with which the Crown must point to a particular offence that is said to underlie the definition of the phrase, ""proceeds of crime"".  Section 193F relevantly provides:(1)  To avoid doubt, it is not necessary, in order to prove for the purposes of an offence under this Part that property is proceeds of crime, to establish that: 
(a)  a particular offence was committed in relation to the property, or
(b)  a particular person committed an offence in relation to the property.
...
6Count three in the indictment (which, as I have said, alleges in short an offence of dealing with proceeds of crime with a particular state of mind, and which carries with it a statutory alternative of a lesser offence that alleges a lesser state of mind) has been brought pursuant to Part 4AC of the Crimes Act (NSW).
7That legislation is very similar to Part 10.2 of the Criminal Code Act 1995  (Cth), which has been the subject of consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2011] NSWCCA 205; 253 FLR 164.
8By majority, that Court held that s 400.13 of the Criminal Code Act (Cth), a provision that, if not identical, is at the least highly analogous to s 193F of the Crimes Act (NSW), does not relieve the Crown of the burden of proving that the subject matter of the charge is derived from a particular offence (such as armed robbery, as opposed to dealing in prohibited drugs or receiving stolen motor vehicles).  It merely relieves the Crown of the burden of proving that the alleged proceeds of crime were derived from a particular criminal event (such as an armed robbery committed on a particular bank branch, at a particular time, by a particular person): see the judgment of Basten JA at [27]-[33] and the judgment of Garling J at [94]-[100].
9In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Ngo [2012] NSWSC 1523; 272 FLR 246, I discussed that decision and came to the view that its analysis did not apply to a separate Commonwealth offence that, although related, had markedly different characteristics: Criminal Code Act (Cth) s 400.9(1A).
10Neither party has taken me to authorities with regard to s 193F of the Crimes Act (NSW), which, as I understand it, commenced in 2005.  
11The learned authors of Criminal Practice and Procedure New South Wales do not refer to any such authority.
12I have been unable to locate any authority on this particular point.  
13Nor have any subsequent authorities that discuss the judgments in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) and Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Ngo been able to be located.
14I consider that the principle enunciated by the majority in Chen v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) applies by analogy to offences under Pt 4AC of the Crimes Act (NSW) and, in particular, to the facilitative provision contained in s 193F.
15As I have said, I consider that the relevant provisions are very similar, if not identical, and are highly analogous.  It follows that, with regard to count three and its alternative, I consider that the Crown must prove that the large amount of cash in the possession of the accused on arrest was derived from a particular offence.  
16Whilst, to my mind, there is certainly powerful circumstantial evidence that the cash was derived from some form of serious criminality, there is no evidence that demonstrates that it is derived from, or even linked to, a particular offence.  
17It follows that there must be a verdict by direction on count three.  I therefore return a verdict of not guilty with regard to it and also with regard to the alternative count attaching to it, which suffers from the same deficiency.**********

		26 February 2014",2014-02-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705484,R v McKellar (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 105,"Judgment
1The special hearing of the allegation that the accused murdered the deceased and committed two other offences commenced yesterday morning.  The accused was present almost continuously until 2 PM, and seemed to be able to control himself and to be free from outward signs of distress.  Due allowance was made by me for his mental, emotional, and intellectual condition (to which I shall refer in more detail in a moment), and I expressed myself to be open to a number of logistical proposals directed towards ensuring his ability to remain present.
2After the luncheon adjournment, senior counsel for the accused informed me that he had instructed her that he was distressed by the Crown's opening; that he did not wish to be in court; that he is hearing voices and that being in court exacerbates that phenomenon; that regrettably in Bathurst Gaol he is held in his cell for 24 hours a day; and that he requests that I recommend that he be returned to a forensic unit in Sydney.  In short, the application was that the special hearing continue in the voluntary absence of the accused.  That application was not opposed by the learned Crown Prosecutor.
3The background is that the accused is alleged to have committed a murder three months short of three years ago.  He was arrested and charged promptly.  The matter has been very much delayed by, in short, questions about the mental condition of the accused.  
4A large number of psychological and psychiatric reports were helpfully tendered by both parties with regard to the application.  They stretch back to 2007, when the question of the fitness of the accused to stand trial was raised with regard to another matter.  The most recent report is of the Mental Health Review Tribunal of 10 September 2013, confirming the opinion that the accused would not become fit to stand trial within 12 months of a determination of unfitness made by this Court on 5 July 2013.  
5There is no need for me to review all of the information contained in those reports in detail.  It is enough to state that, although there has been a soundly based concern that the accused is malingering or exaggerating with regard to at least one of his conditions in the past, nevertheless I accept that the accused is a paranoid schizophrenic who suffers from auditory hallucinations (in other words, he hears voices); has ideas of reference (in other words, he believes that the television set is addressing him personally); and possesses persecutory beliefs (such as that efforts are being made by officers of the Department of Corrective Services to poison him).  Indeed, he first complained of auditory hallucinations well over 15 years ago.
6He also possesses an intellectual impairment described as mild, although it is well known that that term is something of a misnomer.  It is clear that the accused cannot read or write.  
7He also suffers from depression and has engaged in suicidal ideation and made suicidal gestures in the past.  
8Finally, he has in the past been agitated and distressed when in court or even discussing the allegations with medical professionals, although it must be said that he was well behaved yesterday.
9The accused is being medicated for his conditions to the extent possible, including with anti-psychotic medication.  
10In short, on all of the evidence that was placed before me with regard to the application, I accept that the accused is mentally ill and intellectually disabled, and it is in that context that the application is made.  Again, the Crown has not suggested otherwise with regard to that finding of fact.
11Turning to legal principle, since time immemorial the general rule has been that an accused person must be present throughout his or her criminal trial on indictment with regard to an allegation of, at the least, felony: see R v Lee Kun [1916] 1 KB 337 at 341; James Fitzjames Stephen, A Digest of the Law of Criminal Procedure in Indictable Offences  (1883, Macmillan) at 194.  Apart from anything else, the plea of guilty or not guilty must come from the mouth of the accused and not his or her counsel.  As well as that, the right to challenge with regard to the jury is vested in the accused personally.
12However, there are well established exceptions to that principle.  One is if the accused voluntarily absents himself or herself from the trial: R v McHardie and Danielson (1983) 2 NSWLR 733 (escaping from prison); Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 286 (absconding on bail midway through trial).  Another is, as one would expect, if the accused by his or her conduct makes it impossible for the trial to continue: R v Berry (1897) 104 LT 110; R v Mary Browne (1906) 70 JP 472; R v Cornwell (1972) 2 NSWLR 1.  
13Here, of course, the accused is not on trial.  Rather, due to his unfitness to do so, he is facing a special hearing.  Although such a procedure is analogous to a trial, it is by no means identical.  There are some marked differences created by Part 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (NSW) (""the Act""), not least of which is that the default procedure is by way of judge alone as opposed to trial by jury: see s 21A.
14Senior counsel for the accused made a number of separate submissions in support of the application.  
15First, a special hearing proceeds on the assumption that an accused is unfit, so that it is very likely that his or her role in the proceedings will always be markedly reduced.  
16Secondly, s 21(2) of the Act specifically emphasises the requirement of representation subject to court order to the contrary, thereby again focusing on the protection of the interests of the accused by way of a lawyer rather than by his or her own involvement.  I interpolate to say that there is no suggestion that the accused seeks to attempt to dispense with the services of senior counsel, who is widely known as possessing great expertise in the criminal law.
17Thirdly, many of the decided cases turn on the question of prejudice to an accused in that a jury could well draw an adverse inference from the absence of the accused from the courtroom, especially midway through a criminal trial.  That does not, of course, apply in this case.  
18Fourthly, senior counsel for the accused submitted that it would be absurd to force, as it were, this man to disrupt proceedings or even to attempt to escape in order to enliven the discretion to proceed in his absence.  
19I respectfully consider that all of those submissions are soundly based.  Yet again, the Crown has not contended to the contrary.
20I took time to consider the application, not only to read all of the evidence, but also to reflect on it generally.  It is no small thing to be absent with regard to proceedings alleging a murder, whether they be a criminal trial or a special hearing.  I also reflected on the fact that the accused is mentally ill and intellectually disabled, and his choice to seek to be absent may be affected by those conditions.
21I have also been given pause by the fact that there is no more up-to-date psychiatric or psychological report available than one from five months ago.
22On balance, however, in light of: firstly, the mental and intellectual condition of the accused; secondly, the fact that he will remain represented by senior counsel; thirdly, the fact that this is a special hearing and not a trial; fourthly, the fact that there will be no prejudice to the accused arising from his absence; and, fifthly, the fact that the Crown Prosecutor explicitly in the circumstances of this case consents to the application, I consider that I should exercise my discretion to permit the accused to be absent from his special hearing, which will proceed forthwith.  
23As for the recommendation, I am respectfully disinclined to make it.  I know little of the logistical and medical issues relating to the accused and his treatment and placement in the prison system, geographical or otherwise.  
24It is for those reasons that I make the following order: 
(1)The special hearing of the accused may continue in his absence.

2705496,R v Milne (No 2) [2014] NSWSC 113,"Judgment

SENTENCE
1HER HONOUR:  The offender was originally sentenced by his Honour Johnson J on 17 December 2010 after trial (R v Milne (No 6) [2010] NSWSC 1467) on an indictment containing two counts.  The first count was laid contrary to s 400(3)(1) of the Criminal Code and alleged an offence, which I will hereinafter refer to as the money laundering count.  The second count was laid contrary to s 135(1) of the Criminal Code alleging that the offender dishonestly obtained a gain from the Commonwealth.
2His Honour imposed an effective sentence, after partial accumulation, of 8 years and 6 months expiring on 16 June 2019 with a single non-parole period imposed of 4 years and 9 months expiring on 16 September 2015.
3I sentenced the offender in respect of an offence on a separate indictment on 14 December 2012 (R v Milne [2012] NSWSC 1538).  That offence was laid contrary to s 135(1) of the Criminal Code.
4I imposed a term of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 17 June 2018 and to expire on 16 June 2020.  Having regard to the currency of the sentence imposed by Johnson J, I imposed a new effective sentence of 9 years and 6 months expiring on 16 June 2020, with a single non-parole period of 5 years to date from 17 December 2012 and expiring on 16 December 2015.
5On 14 February 2014 the High Court quashed the conviction in relation to the money laundering count and ordered that the commencement of the sentence with respect to the remaining count imposed by Johnson J be amended to commence on 17 December 2010 and to expire on 16 June 2014.  No adjustments were made with respect to the sentence I imposed in December 2012.  In the result, the sentence I imposed now commences after the expiry of the remaining sentence imposed by Johnson J.  That is a result which is contrary to law (see s 16E(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 47(2)(b) and 47(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)). 
6In these circumstances it is appropriate that, on the joint application of both parties, the sentence proceedings should be reopened pursuant to s 43(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
7The agreed position of the parties is that there is no warrant to interfere with the length of the term of imprisonment I imposed on 14 December 2012.  I accept that submission.
8The parties are also in agreement that there should be some degree of concurrency between the sentences and I accept that submission.  The degree of concurrency will be ordered consistent with the reasoning expressed by me in [53] of the sentencing judgment of 14 December 2012.
9Since the approach to re-sentence will result in unserved portions of the sentences imposed not exceeding three years, the appropriate order in all the circumstances is for a recognisance release order to issue pursuant to s 19AC(2) of the Crimes Act.
10On re-sentence, in respect of the charge laid contrary to s 151(1) of the Criminal Code, the subject of the earlier sentencing proceeding, I impose a sentence of 2 years to date from 17 June 2013 and to expire on 16 June 2015 which, having regard to the sentence imposed by Johnson J, results in an aggregate sentence of 4 years and 6 months.
11I direct the issue of a recognizance release order for Mr Milne's immediate release, which in the result would represent a pre-release period of three years, two months and four days.
12The term of the recognizance is to be equal to the aggregate sentence imposed.  The recognizance to be entered self without security in the sum of $500.

		07 March 2014",2014-02-19 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705504,Carlton v R [2014] NSWCCA 14,"Judgment
1WARD JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2HARRISON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J
3R A HULME J:  Adam Rawdon Carlton (""the appellant"") was sentenced by his Honour Judge Nield in the District Court on 23 February 2007 for four offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent.  
4His Honour imposed concurrent terms of imprisonment for 13 years 4 months with non-parole periods of 8 years 6 months.  The sentences were specified to commence on 21 August 2005.  The appellant will become eligible for release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole periods on 20 February 2014.  The total terms of the sentences will expire on 20 December 2018.
5The offences are contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years.  A standard non-parole period of 10 years applies pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).
6The appellant applied for leave to appeal against both conviction and sentence.  Leave was granted but the appeal failed: Carlton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 244; (2008) 189 A Crim R 332.
7On 5 October 2011 the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120.  This prompted the appellant to apply under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) for an inquiry concerning his sentence.  He contended that there was a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in his case, namely that his sentence was infected by error in that undue weight was accorded to the standard non-parole period contrary to the decision in Muldrock.  The Attorney General conceded the point.
8Latham J granted the application and, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, referred the matter to this Court to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).
Is leave to appeal required and, if so, is an extension of time required?
9The Crown conceded that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred.  But it argued that leave to appeal was required and, because of the lengthy period that had elapsed, an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal was also required.
10I digress for a moment to explain how this issue has arisen.  That can be best done by quoting from the judgment of Basten JA in Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383:
[6]  Since the judgment in Muldrock, there have been a significant number of cases challenging the approach of sentencing judges who had (correctly at the time) followed the guidance of Way [R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168], which tended to result in higher sentences than would application of the principles laid down in Muldrock. In some cases, such challenges could be dealt with in the ordinary course of an appeal against sentence, within time, under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5. Other cases required an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal. A third category of cases involved offenders who had already exercised their rights of appeal against sentence prior to the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock.
11The appellant falls within the last of those three categories.  According to the submissions for the Crown, the present case is the first to have been referred to this Court under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.  
12The Court has recently dealt with a large number of cases that fall within the second category where an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal has been required. (More are pending.)  The requirement to establish that an extension of time should be granted where the application for leave to appeal is based upon a change in the interpretation of the law relating to sentencing for standard non-parole period offences has been regarded as a not insignificant hurdle facing an appellant for leave to appeal: see, for example, Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 and Alpha v R [2013] NSWCCA 292.
13Ms Lydiard, counsel for the Crown, sought to explain why the point was being taken in the circumstances of this case: ""it just would assist if there was some statement about whether an extension of time and leave to appeal is necessary in matters such as this"", there being, according to her research, no authority on the point.
14Mr McLachlan, counsel for the appellant, was taken by surprise by this preliminary issue.  It was raised in the written submissions for Crown filed only two days before the hearing.  No attempt had been possible to marshal such evidence as may be available to explain the delay, for example, between delivery of the judgment in Muldrock and the filing of the Pt 7 application.  The Court indicated at the hearing that leave would be granted for further evidence and submissions to be filed if that became necessary.
15Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides for the review of convictions and sentences.  There are a number of mechanisms for review; the one relevant to the present case is that in Div 3 which provides for applications to the Supreme Court.  A successful application may result in either a direction that an inquiry into the conviction or sentence be conducted by a judicial officer (s 79(1)(a)) or referral ""of the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912"" (s 79(1)(b)).
16Referral of ""the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912"" is also an available outcome for a successful application via another mechanism provided for review of convictions and sentences, namely by a petition to the Governor under Div 2 (s 77(1)(b)).
17Division 5 deals with matters that may be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal by various means under Pt 7, including by way of s 77(1)(b) and s 79(1)(b).  In relation to cases referred by those two mechanisms, s 86 provides:
86   Reference to Court under section 77(1)(b) or 79(1)(b) following petition to Governor or application to Supreme CourtOn receiving a reference under section 77(1)(b) or 79(1)(b), the Court is to deal with the case so referred in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, and that Act applies accordingly.
18The question raised by the Crown in the present case involves the construction of this provision.  The Crown points to the fact that if a convicted person appeals against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act, there is a requirement to obtain leave to appeal and if the proceeding is brought out of time, there is also a requirement to obtain an extension of time.  The Crown's contention is, in effect, that there is no reason why these requirements should not also apply in proceedings referred to the Court under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.
19A person may appeal against his or her conviction as of right on any ground that involves a question of law alone: s 5(1)(a) Criminal Appeal Act.  Otherwise, an appeal against conviction and all appeals against sentence can only be made with leave of the Court: s 5(1)(b) and (c).  Section 6 then provides how an appeal may be determined.
20Section 86 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act requires the Court to deal with a case referred under ss 77(1)(b) or 79(1)(b) in the same way ""as if the convicted person had appealed"".  If it had been the intention of Parliament that leave would be required, as in the majority of cases coming before this Court, it could be expected that s 86 would say so.
21Referral to this Court under ss 77 and 79 may be seen as circumventing a number of preliminary matters normally required:  for example, the filing of a notice of appeal.  Indeed, it was held in A reference by the Attorney General for the State of New South Wales under s 77(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 re the conviction of Frederick Lincoln McDermott [2013] NSWCCA 102; (2013) 303 ALR 143 at [16] per Bathurst CJ (Johnson and Button JJ agreeing), that aside from there being no requirement for a notice of appeal to be lodged, there was no requirement for any action to be taken by the convicted person at all, the convicted person in that case being long deceased.
22In my view, the process of referral to the Court under Pt 7 circumvents the need for consideration of whether leave should be granted.  That makes sense, as someone has already determined that there is merit; otherwise the referral would not have been made.  By ss 77(2) and 79(2), referral may only occur if the Minister (s 77) or the Supreme Court (s 79) has been determined:
(2)  ... that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.
23Although the Court in McDermott was dealing with a different question (whether a right of appeal by a convicted person abates upon death), it is notable that (at [22]) the Chief Justice referred to the words in s 86, ""as if the convicted person had appealed"", as indicating that ""the Court is to treat the appeal as one properly brought and which it had power to deal with under s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act"".  Of course, the Court usually only has power to deal with a matter under s 6 if it has first granted any necessary extension of time and leave to appeal. The statement that the Court has power to deal with a referred matter under s 6 supports the proposition that those preliminary matters are by-passed.
24The necessity to seek an extension of time is also circumvented by this referral process.  It is difficult to envisage that a matter could come before this Court by way of referral and not be out of time. There is provision in both s 77(3) and s 79(3) for the Governor, Minister or the Supreme Court, as the case may be, to refuse to consider or otherwise deal with a petition or application for a number of reasons, including where the person's appeal rights have not been pursued to finality.  Similarly, there is provision in both s 77(3A) and s 79(3A) for consideration of a petition or application to be deferred if the time in which the person may pursue an appeal is still running.
25A decision to refer a matter to this Court under either s 77 or s 79 is discretionary.  Where a significant and unexplained delay has occurred, that may well be a relevant matter to be considered in the exercise of the discretion.
26The Crown pointed to a potential anomaly in the way cases in the second and third categories referred to by Basten JA in Sinkovich (at [6]) are dealt with.  Where the person's appeal rights have not been exhausted, but an extension of time is required, there is the hurdle of the Court needing to consider the matters relevant to the application of the principle of finality that were listed in the judgment of the Court (Hoeben CJ at CL, Johnson and Bellew JJ) in Abdul at [53]:
the length of and reasons for the delay; the interests of the community;
the interests of the victim; and
whether substantial injustice would result if an extension of time were refused.
27However, in the case of a person whose appeal rights have been exhausted and who applies to the Supreme Court, all that is necessary to establish, aside from discretionary factors, is a ""doubt or question"" of the type referred to in s 79(2).  I accept that there might well be an anomaly but in practical terms that would only be if the types of matters this Court would consider on an application for an extension of time were not considered by the Supreme Court (or the Minister) as part of the discretionary determination of whether a referral should be made.
28In Sinkovich, Basten JA, in obiter dicta (at [56]-[62]), discussed the relevance of the principle of finality to the exercise of the discretionary power arising under s 79 once what he termed the ""condition precedent, or gateway"" provision in s 79(2) had been made out.  His Honour cited English authority dealing with a statutory scheme similar in scope but not identical in its terms.  If that authority were to be applied in New South Wales, it would be to the effect that in considering an application under Pt 7, consideration should be given to the practice of the Court of Criminal Appeal in dealing with out of time appeals as explained in Abdul and Alpha. 
29I can see no sensible reason why that approach ought not to be taken in the discretionary aspect of Pt 7 determinations.  Basten JA suggested as much at an earlier point in his judgment (at [51]).
30Support for the proposition that leave to appeal, and an extension of time in which to apply for it, are unnecessary in cases referred to the Court under s 79 (and s 77) may be found in a number of such cases previously considered. 
31Yin v R [2007] NSWCCA 350 concerned a sentence that was the subject of referral by the Supreme Court pursuant to s 79(1)(b).  The offences had been committed in 2002; sentencing took place in 2003; an appeal failed in 2005; a co-offender's appeal succeeded in March 2007; and the offender then made an application pursuant to Pt 7 complaining that he had a legitimate sense of grievance arising from the reduction of the co-offender's sentence.  Barr J considered the application and made the referral to this Court on 15 August 2007.  His Honour also was a member of the bench that determined the matter in December 2007.  His Honour's judgment, with which Mason P and Bell J agreed, contained no mention of leave to appeal or extending time.  The judgment commenced:  ""This is an appeal against sentence ..."". 
32GAR v R (No 1) [2010] NSWCCA 163 may be regarded as anomalous. It was a referral in relation to conviction and, as it did not fall within s 5(1)(a), a question was raised as to whether leave to appeal was required. In their joint judgment, Tobias JA, Johnson and Rothman JJ did not discuss the issue at any length and did not mention s 86.  Their Honours simply said (at [20]) that ""[i]n our view the better construction is that leave is required"".  However, it was unnecessary to express a concluded view as leave was to be granted in any event because the grounds of appeal were arguable.
33In Kearns v R [2011] NSWCCA 103 there was a Ministerial referral in respect of conviction.  It was accepted that none of the grounds of appeal involved a question of law alone.  Giles JA reviewed some earlier cases which were concerned with referrals under the predecessor to Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, namely Pt 13A of the Crimes Act. (For a detailed review of the history of this legislation, see the judgment of Basten JA in Sinkovich at [33]-[41]).  His Honour stated:
[18]  If leave to appeal is necessary, until leave has been granted there is no appeal. On one view, ss 77(1)(b), 79(1)(b) and 86 dictate that there is an appeal, and the direction to deal with the case ""as if the convicted person had appealed against conviction"" bypasses any need for leave to appeal under s 5(1). The Criminal Appeal Act then applies as to the Court's powers and in particular in the disposal of the appeal in accordance with s 6 of that Act. On another view, the words ""as if the convicted person had appealed against conviction"" refer to the convicted person's act of appealing against conviction, which could include any necessary application for leave to appeal, and may not dictate that there is an appeal. The pivotal s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act , and also s 7, apply where there is ""an appeal under s 5(1)"", and if a referral bypasses a need for leave to appeal under s 5(1) it may be that there is a difficulty in the application of these provisions; so that ss 77(1)(b), 79(1)(b) and 86 should be understood conformably with the leave requirement in s 5(1).
[19] I incline to the view that leave to appeal is not necessary. The leave requirement in s 5(1) acts as a filter, the alternative in that subsection of the trial judge's certificate that it is a fit case for appeal having the same function. The referral by the Minister (s 77) or the Supreme Court (s 79) is made after a petition for review or an application for an inquiry, and the consideration of the petition for review or the conduct of the inquiry takes the place of consideration of an application for leave to appeal and makes inappropriate a superadded need for leave. The referral involves satisfaction that the case is fit to be dealt with as an appeal.
34There followed some discussion about the fact that only one ground was founded upon the referral but further grounds had been added.  His Honour cited authority for the proposition that as the ""whole case"" was the subject of referral, it was necessary for the Court to determine the additional grounds, unless they were thought to be frivolous or vexatious.  Ultimately, his Honour said (at [24]) that ""if leave to appeal be necessary it should be granted"".  
35Latham J agreed with Giles JA.  Rothman J published separate reasons concerning this issue. In his view, no leave was required in respect of the ground the subject of the referral:  ""The reference replaces, where it may otherwise have been required, the grant of leave by the Court or the issue of a certificate by the trial judge"" (at [119]). His Honour stated (at [125]) that leave was required in the case of all of the other grounds of appeal. But, similar to Giles JA, his Honour concluded (at [126]) by saying that ""it is unnecessary to determine the issue finally. If leave were necessary, it should be granted"". 
36I return to McDermott.  In the course of noting a number of matters before announcing his conclusion that the death of Mr McDermott did not prevent the Court's determination of the case following a Ministerial referral, Bathurst CJ stated:
[16] Second, s 77(1)(b) of the Act empowers the Minister to refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal. There is no requirement for a Notice of Appeal to be lodged or, for that matter, any action to be taken by the convicted person. As Spigelman CJ said in R v Doyle [2001] NSWCCA 252; (2001) 123 A Crim R 151 at [62]-[63] in respect of equivalent provisions in the Crimes Act, s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act which confers a right of appeal on a person convicted on indictment, effectively is bypassed. Thus, a reference under the equivalent of s 77(1)(b) of the Act in that case both empowered and required the Court of Criminal Appeal under the s 86 equivalent to deal with the matter on appeal, notwithstanding the fact that it was a summary conviction to which the appeal rights conferred by s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act would not apply. See also R v Johns [1999] NSWCCA 206; (1999) 110 A Crim R 149 at [5]; R v Pederick (Court of Criminal Appeal, unreported, 21 May 1997) per Hunt CJ at CL; Re Application of Pearson [1999] NSWSC 143; (1999) 46 NSWLR 148 at 157.
37There is a further aspect of the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v Doyle [2001] NSWCCA 252; (2001) 123 A Crim R 151 that should be noted. The case was concerned with the provisions of the former Pt 13A of the Crimes Act but the terms of the relevant provisions were the same as now found in Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.  After the statement at [62] about s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act being ""by-passed"" his Honour said:
[63] The effect of s 474L [the predecessor to s 86] is that this Court finds its power by going directly to s 6 ...
Conclusion
38In summary, the Court assumed in Yin that the matter before it was an appeal and there was no question about leave (or an extension of time).  In GAR (No 1) the Court thought that leave was probably required.  But in Kearns, a majority of the Court considered that leave was probably not required (the third member being positive that it was not required in relation to the ground the subject of the referral).  Having regard to the judgment of the present Chief Justice in McDermott and the former Chief Justice in Doyle, supported by my own view of the proper construction of the statutory provisions, I am satisfied that no leave to appeal is required in respect of a referral of a case to this Court pursuant to s 77(1)(b) or s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act.  It follows that no extension of time to seek leave to appeal is required either.
39I would only qualify this conclusion by saying that it is unequivocal in respect of grounds of appeal raising matters that are the subject of the referral.  If an appellant seeks to raise additional grounds, I tend to agree with Giles JA in Kearns that the Court is required to consider them unless they are thought to be frivolous or vexatious.  I refrain from expressing a concluded view on that aspect given that the point was not argued in the present case. 
Facts
40The appellant was convicted after a trial before Nield DCJ in the District Court at Bathurst in 2006.  There was no dispute about the facts as recounted in his Honour's reasons for sentence and so I have drawn the following from that source.
41The offences occurred on the one occasion on 20 August 2005 in a house in Canowindra.  The appellant had met the 10-year old complainant once or twice before.  He went to her home on that day at around lunchtime.  She asked him if he would take her to a property outside of town so that she could visit her friend.  The appellant knew that the only car available to him was unusable because of a defect.  Nevertheless he sought the complainant's father's permission to take her to visit her friend and he agreed.
42The appellant and complainant walked to another house in Canowindra where he obtained a pornographic DVD.  They then proceeded towards another house where the appellant was temporarily living.  The appellant made a telephone call to the complainant's friend's mother and asked her whether it was all right to bring out the complainant to play with her friend.  The mother told him that the friend was away at a sleepover.  Rather than taking the complainant back home, he took her to his place.
43After they arrived the appellant injected himself with something that he told the complainant was ""speed"".  He then put on the pornographic DVD and forced her to watch it. He then pulled her pants down and penetrated her anus with a finger (count 1); then with his penis (count 2); and then with a vibrator (count 3).  Finally the appellant penetrated her genitalia with his penis before withdrawing and ejaculating onto a pillow (count 4).  
44The appellant took the child home at about 7pm where he was confronted by her father who was concerned.  He had telephoned his daughter's friend's mother at about 6pm and had been told that the proposed visit to the friend had not occurred.  The complainant made an immediate disclosure of what had occurred.  
45The appellant was arrested the following day (21 August 2005) and has been in custody since.

Assessment of objective seriousness
46The learned judge rejected a submission by the appellant's then counsel that the offences were unplanned and opportunistic; instead finding that the appellant's conduct prior to the offences demonstrated his intention to do what he did and ""his planning to achieve his intention"".
47His Honour accepted a submission that there was no violence (beyond the sexual assaults themselves).  But he also noted that the appellant had led the complainant to believe that she could not leave the premises because the front door was locked and he threatened her when telling her not to tell anybody about what had happened.  His Honour later stated by reference to s 21A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the threatened use of violence was an aggravating feature.
48He accepted that the complainant had not suffered any physical injury but took into account a likelihood of an adverse impact upon the child's sexual and emotional development that might not manifest itself for some years.
49The judge accepted that the appellant had a mental illness and that it played a part in his commission of the offences.  Accordingly, he found that the appellant's moral responsibility for the offences was reduced. 
50Other aggravating features bearing upon the objective seriousness of the offences that were taken into account by reference to s 21A(2) were that the appellant had assumed responsibility for the complainant while she was in his care and that her age, 10 years 6 months, made her vulnerable.
Subjective features taken into account
51The judge noted that the appellant was aged in his mid-thirties. He referred to his family background which included that his parents separated when he was aged four; he lost contact with his father; and his mother remarried when he was aged seven but she and his stepfather separated when he was thirteen.  Despite these matters, his Honour said that the appellant had been raised by his mother in a happy and supportive environment.
52The appellant left school in Year 11 and thereafter had been mostly unemployed.  He had commenced using cannabis in his mid-teenage years and had gone on to using other drugs including LSD, ecstasy, amphetamine, cocaine and heroin. The judge described the appellant's use of drugs as having caused a ""downward spiral into a life of crime"".
53Reference was made to the appellant being treated with medication for a mental illness in 2001-2002 and being diagnosed in September 2002 as suffering from schizophrenia.  He failed to take his medication as and when required and was not taking it, and was using illicit drugs, at the time of the offences.
54The appellant had an extensive criminal record but there were no previous sexual offences.  The judge said that he ""suspected"" that many of the offences on the record related to the appellant's involvement with drugs.  It was held (correctly) to be an aggravating feature that the offences occurred while the appellant was on conditional liberty by way of being on suspended sentence bond.
55The judge found that none of the mitigating factors listed in s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were present.  However, he accepted that if the appellant complied with treatment for his mental illness there was a reasonable chance that he would be rehabilitated and would not re-offend.
56General and personal deterrence were regarded as ""not as important in this case as it might be in another case"" on account of the appellant's mental illness.
Approach to the standard non-parole period
57The appellant's counsel submitted that the offences ""fell toward the bottom of the middle of the range of objective seriousness"".  The Crown Prosecutor argued that they ""fell in the high end of the range"".  The judge concluded:
[T]hat the offences fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness and that, therefore, the standard non parole period is the starting point for the determination of appropriate sentence.
58The error was compounded by his Honour continuing immediately to say:
I have determined that, balancing everything that I have said about the offences and the offender, that the standard non parole period of 10 years is the appropriate starting point for the sentences, so that the appropriate sentence for each offence is imprisonment for 13 years four months.
59Clearly, his Honour adopted a two-staged approach to the sentencing task and appears to have regarded the standard non-parole period as having determinative significance: Cf Muldrock at [26]-[29].  
60None of this should be taken to be critical of his Honour.  Clearly he was following the dictates of R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 which the Crown had been promoting consistently in this Court until in 2011 it decided to argue for the first time in the High Court that it was wrongly decided.
Concurrency of the sentences
61The judge rejected a submission by the Crown Prosecutor that there should be some partial accumulation of the individual sentences in order to properly punish the appellant for having committed four separate and distinct offences.  He accepted the submission by the appellant's counsel that the sentences should be concurrent because they were ""committed by the one offender upon the one complainant over a relatively short period of time"".
Special circumstances
62Whilst he rejected a submission that the appellant's need for long-term treatment for his mental illness was a basis for finding special circumstances, the judge accepted that his classification as a ""non association"" prisoner, making ""prison life more onerous than it should be"" did warrant a reduction of the proportion of the sentences to be represented by the non-parole periods.
Grounds of appeal
63There are two grounds of appeal:
1. The sentencing judge erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120 with respect to each count. 2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account the effect of the appellant's mental illness in respect of the circumstances of his imprisonment and the combined effect of the appellant's mental illness and his segregation within the prison system.
64Ground 1 was the basis of the referral by Latham J to this Court.  It was conceded by the Attorney General in the Pt 7 proceeding and is again conceded by the Crown here.  The concession is appropriate for the reasons I have earlier mentioned.  
65That is reason enough to move to consider whether less severe sentences were warranted and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  But it will be necessary in that exercise to consider the arguments advanced in relation to the other ground.
Ground 2
66Counsel for the appellant referred to the judgments given in the earlier appeal to this Court: Carlton v R, supra. Basten JA summarised the effect of the ground(s) of appeal as follows:
[85] ...The appellant's complaints are two-fold: first, it is contended that his Honour failed to consider relevant factors which might have led him not to apply the standard non-parole period and, secondly, that his Honour failed to give proper weight to the appellant's mental illness.
67After dealing with the judge's approach to the standard non-parole period, Basten JA turned to the issue that is at the heart of Ground 2 in the present proceeding and said:
[112] There is no doubt that prison conditions are onerous for many members of the community. Imprisonment constitutes punishment, but the punishment should not be the imposition of unduly onerous conditions. If the conditions are likely to be more onerous for one class of prisoner, that should be taken into account on sentencing. It appears that the appellant's psychotic condition is kept in control by medication. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the combination of isolation, or limited association, together with the evident symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to render a prison environment more onerous for the appellant than for a person to whom either of those conditions applies separately. The fact that his Honour failed to take account of the effect of his mental illness in respect of the circumstances of his imprisonment and the combined effect of his mental illness and his segregation within the prison system, constituted a failure to take account of relevant circumstances.
68His Honour then stated (at [113]) that the judge was in error in only taking into account the circumstances of the appellant's custodial experience in relation to setting the non-parole period (by the finding of special circumstances) when it was a matter that was relevant to the setting of the overall term of the sentence.
69His Honour then referred to affidavit evidence that was before the Court in the event it was moved to consider re-sentencing:
[114] It appears that the conditions of segregation are likely to continue. In an affidavit filed on 22 August 2008 in these proceedings and available for the purpose of re-sentencing, the appellant stated that he was now at John Morony Correctional Centre at Berkshire Park. He stated that he had been there since he was sentenced. The affidavit continued:
""I requested that I be kept apart from other prisoners. That was because I was fearful what might happen to me if other prisoners knew why I was in custody. I was a non-association prisoner for fourteen months. Over that time I had a small yard two metres by two metres attached to my cell. I was allowed to be in the yard for six hours a day. I suffer from schizophrenia. Over that time I also became depressed. I have been medicated for my schizophrenia. I receive zyprexol and respirodone.
I am now a limited association prisoner. This means that I am in a POD with a small number of other prisoners. There are seven of us together. I am the wing sweeper. The other prisoners are also classified as 'sex offenders'. I am cautious about having too much to do with most of them.
Because I have been a non-association prisoner and a limited association prisoner there have not been any courses or educational facilities available for me. My part of the prison has a small library. There is, however, nothing to help me educate myself for when I am released.""
70Basten JA concluded that a total sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 8 months should be imposed.
71Price J expressed agreement that the sentencing judge had erred as described at [112] of the judgment of Basten JA.  However, he considered that no lesser sentence was warranted for the following reasons:
[121] For his own sexual gratification, the appellant inflicted four different acts of gross indecency on a 10 year old child. Three of those acts involved the penetration of the child's anus; the first by his finger, the second by his penis and the third by the insertion of the blue-coloured vibrator. Each act by itself occasioned harm to the complainant. The fourth offence concerned penile penetration of the child's genitalia which involved separate harm to her.
[122] The purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 include a recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community. The imposition of totally concurrent sentences, to my mind, fails to acknowledge the separate harm done to the child by the different criminal acts of the appellant. In my view, there are occasions when a sentencing Court should take care to ensure that consideration of an offender's behaviour being closely related in time does not obscure the fact that different offences were committed. This was, it seems to me, such an occasion. There should have at least been partial accumulation of some of the sentences. Total concurrency of the sentences was generous to the appellant.
72Hislop J agreed with Price J.  Accordingly, leave to appeal against sentence was granted but the appeal was dismissed.
Submissions
73The essence of the appellant's case in relation to Ground 2 was reliance upon the reasoning of Basten JA set out above, noting that it had the agreement of the other two members of the Court.
74No complaint was raised in the 2008 appeal about the judge's approach, in a technical sense, to the standard non-parole period.  It is now contended that consideration by the Court, and particularly by Price and Hislop JJ, of whether a lesser sentence was warranted must have been influenced by what had been said in R v Way about the correct approach and so the conclusion of the majority in 2008 should be seen in that light.  It was submitted that application of the approach mandated by Muldrock would lead to the conclusion that a lesser sentence was in fact warranted.
75It is hard to understand whether the Crown resisted this Court upholding Ground 2.  Most of the written submissions were devoted to a question of whether the appellant's mental illness was causally related to the offending.  That was an issue decided in the appellant's favour by the sentencing judge and not brought into issue by Ground 2.  Brief reference was made to the appellant's reliance upon the decision in the 2008 appeal.  It was not, however, contended that the Court should now come to a different conclusion.  Rather, it was contended that no lesser sentence was warranted, primarily, but not only, because of the ""generous"" approach by the sentencing judge in making the sentences completely concurrent.
Determination
76There was no complaint about the approach taken by Nield DCJ in taking into account the appellant's mental illness in a variety of ways in the assessment of sentence.  However, I accept that he was in error in limiting the relevance of the more onerous custodial conditions partly as a result of his mental illness and partly as a result of being held in a more restrictive gaol environment to the setting of the non-parole period.  Like Price and Hislop JJ, I respectfully agree with the reasoning and conclusion of Basten JA.
77However, if leave to appeal is required in respect of this ground because it was not the subject of the Pt 7 referral, I would refuse it.  There was no need for the ground to be raised, a point counsel for the appellant virtually conceded at the hearing.  The appellant already had the finding of the Court in 2008 that was in his favour.  The subject matter of this ground, together with fresh affidavit evidence concerning it, provides relevant material for the Court to consider on the s 6(3) issue following the upholding of Ground 1.
Were less severe sentences warranted?
78A starting point is to accept the unchallenged finding by the sentencing judge that each of the offences was in the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  The making of such a finding does not run counter to Muldrock:  Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44; (2012) 223 A Crim R 460 at [46]; Beldon v R [2012] NSWCCA 194 at [78]; McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [28].
79A further matter to take into account is the aggravating factor of the appellant being on conditional liberty at the time of the offences.
80It is then necessary to have regard to the ways in which the appellant's mental illness impacted upon the assessment of sentence. Aside from reduced moral culpability there was the judge's determination, with which I agree, that there should be some reduction in the weight to be given to general and personal deterrence.  Then there are the onerous circumstances of the appellant's custodial experience resulting from the combination of his mental illness and being kept in some degree of protective custody.
81Affidavits were read in the event the Court was to consider resentencing.  The appellant deposed that in early 2011 (other material suggests it was earlier) he voluntarily left the limited association protective custody he had been in and became ""a normal protection prisoner"" so that he could gain better access to programs to improve himself.  However he remains in fear of retribution because of the nature of his crimes. Other material confirms that he has been threatened.  On one occasion he was involved in a ""minor scuffle"" and received a ""small (very) wound"" to his right knee ""from a pen"".
82The fact that the appellant left the more restrictive custodial conditions in which he had been formerly held does not diminish the significance of his argument that such onerous conditions were relevant to the assessment of sentence.  The fact remains that he had been held in such conditions for a significant period, some five or six years.
83The appellant said that he had been compliant with the regime of medication prescribed to treat his schizophrenia. He has turned to Buddhism and meditation to also assist in managing his mental illness. He is involved with behavioural therapy sessions and counselling with psychologists.  He has engaged in responsible types of employment and has participated in education programs.  He has received commendations for his program participation as well as for his work and behaviour.
84The appellant's mother's affidavit confirms her enduring support.  She has observed the fear that he feels about the prospect of retribution for the nature of his crimes since his transfer to a less protected classification.
85Having regard to all of the circumstances, I consider that, when looking at the individual sentences and assessing them without giving the standard non-parole period determinative (or even primary) significance, lesser sentences are warranted.
86However, a prominent question in this context is whether the sentences should have been partially accumulated as the Crown contended.  The answer must be affirmative.  
87The principle is well established.  Once the individual sentences are determined, it is then that one must consider issues of concurrency, accumulation and the principle of totality:  Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [45] (McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ).  That determination is carried out in the fashion described so clearly by Howie J in Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41:
[27] In any event there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality. Of course it is more likely that, where the offences are discrete and independent criminal acts, the sentence for one offence cannot comprehend the criminality of the other. Similarly, where they are part of a single episode of criminality with common factors, it is more likely that the sentence for one of the offences will reflect the criminality of both.
88Further, it is not necessarily the case that multiple sexual offences committed in the course of a single incident should result in concurrent sentences:  see, for example, R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; (2002) 137 A Crim R 326.
89In the present case, the totality of the criminality of the appellant is greater than the criminality involved in any one of the individual offences.  Partial accumulation of the sentences was called for.
90In resentencing for the individual offences I had in mind terms of 11 years but they would be accumulated by 9 months.  That would yield an overall term that is insignificantly different to that originally imposed and the non-parole component would be the same.  There is no practical utility in resentencing.  The appeal should be dismissed.
Order
91I propose the following order:
Appeal against sentence dismissed.

2705506,Frahm v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 10,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceThe applicant entered pleas of guilty to offences of larceny, contrary to s117 of the Crimes Act 1900 which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years and knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime, contrary to s193B(2) which has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years.
2On 6 February 2013 the applicant was sentenced by Judge Maiden SC in the Newcastle District Court as follows:
For the offence of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime, imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 3 August 2012 and expiring 2 August 2014 with a balance of term of 1 year expiring 2 August 2015.
For the offence of larceny, a conviction with no other penalty pursuant to s10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal on a single ground:
The sentence imposed for the offence of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime is manifestly excessive.
Factual Background
4On 13 July 2012 a robbery occurred in Scott Street, Newcastle.  The victim was robbed of her handbag containing personal items, a wallet, passports and $25,475.95 in cash, which she had just withdrawn from the Commonwealth Bank.  Three persons were involved and the plan was to use a car to escape after the robbery.  The plan was foiled when bystanders blocked the path of the getaway car, causing one of the offenders to run from the car with the handbag containing the personal items and $25,475.95 in cash.  He ran into a nearby convenience store and dumped the bag after removing approximately $10,000 for himself.  He fled on foot, leaving the handbag containing the personal items and the remaining $16,000 on the floor of the convenience store.
5The applicant had just arrived in Newcastle, having caught a bus from Toronto.  He was standing at the bus stop when the robbery took place and watched the offenders remove the handbag from the victim.  He saw one of the offenders run inside the convenience store with the handbag.  Immediately after that offender exited the store, the applicant entered holding a blue cooler bag in his hands.  The applicant walked to where the victim's handbag had just been dumped, picked it up and placed it inside his blue cooler bag.  He then walked directly out of the store without making any purchase.  The applicant was not associated with the persons who carried out the robbery and had no involvement in the robbery.
6The applicant walked around the corner into a laneway, looked inside the handbag and saw that it contained about $16,000 in cash.  He and his girlfriend then caught a taxi to Charlestown Square where they spent some of the money on items of clothing.  Some time later they returned to the caravan park at Freemans Waterhole where they were living and paid $1,000 for rent.  They also purchased a car from one of the residents at the caravan park.
7The applicant and his girlfriend later secreted some of the stolen cash in their caravan and travelled to a nearby hotel to play the poker machines with the money they had taken with them.  They spent the night at the Ibis Motel in Newcastle.  All of this was paid for using cash from the stolen handbag.
8The following day, they returned to their caravan at Freemans Waterhole and discovered that it had been broken into and that the remaining proceeds of the robbery had been stolen.  Police were notified of the break in and later attended to take fingerprints.  During the course of this procedure, police observed clothing and the blue cooler bag and advised Newcastle Detectives.  As a result, the applicant was arrested several days later.  He participated in an ERISP with Taree Police, making full admissions as to his involvement in the larceny of the handbag and his subsequent dealings with the money after the larceny.
9The handbag contained the following items:Louis Vuitton wallet.
2 Chinese passports.
Bankcards.
Driver's licence.
Personal cards and papers.
$16,000 in cash.
The total value of the items stolen was $17,590.  The only property recovered was the car, which had been purchased for $1,500.
Remarks on sentence
10In relation to the applicant, his Honour made the following observations and findings.
(i) He had a lengthy criminal history and a lengthy experience with drugs, including heroin, ice and other serious drugs.
(ii) He was not part of the earlier robbery, but engaged in these offences spontaneously when the opportunity presented itself.
(iii) All of the monies were disposed of in the space of 5 days, including the money that was stolen from the caravan.
(iv) Upon being contacted by the police, the applicant made a full confession and admissions and was therefore entitled to a discount of 25 percent on his sentence.
(v) His criminal record was ""appalling"".  It included many matters such as break and enters, stealing, a serious assault matter and a further break and enter for which he received a period of imprisonment.
(vi) While waiting to be sentenced, the applicant spent time at Bennelong's Haven, a rehabilitation facility, and that period of time was to be regarded as quasi custody.
(vii) This was a most serious offence because the applicant took the whole of the money and there was no attempt to return any part of the $16,000 at any time.
(viii) The applicant's decision to engage in the offending occurred when he was affected by serious drugs and when his intellectual functioning was not fully competent.
(ix) An overriding consideration, while taking into account his confession and remorse, was specific deterrence and general deterrence.
(x) Where monies are taken from an enterprise of crime and then fully spent without a chance of repayment, a significant period of custody was called for.
Subjective Case
11No reports were tendered on behalf of the applicant on sentence.  He did, however, give evidence.  In the remarks on sentence his Honour accepted the applicant's evidence but did not refer to it in any detail.  Given the nature of the single ground of appeal relied upon, it is necessary to say something about the applicant's evidence and his subjective case.  
12The applicant left school before finishing Year 8 and started using amphetamines and ice when he was aged about 13.  He was charged with a number of offences as a child, commencing when he was aged 15.  Thereafter, he had been ""in and out"" of juvenile detention centres.  While in detention, he completed Year 10 and obtained his forklift licence.  He studied hospitality at Tafe and worked as a baker at Tip Top ""on and off"" for three years.  He had been in a relationship from which a child now aged 9 was born.  He had relapsed into drug use and served various prison sentences.  He was aged 29 at the time of sentence.
13At the time of the offending, he had been living in the caravan park for about 6 to 8 months.  He was unemployed and using amphetamines on a daily basis. 
14After his arrest, he had been bailed to reside at Bennelong's Haven, where he was drug free.  He had been taken from there to hospital for the treatment of gallstones.  In hospital he had been given morphine for the pain.  After his discharge from hospital, he did not return to Bennelong's Haven and was arrested shortly afterwards for breaching his bail conditions.
15He said that he would like to return to a rehabilitation program, since this was the first time that he had attempted to rehabilitate himself.  Although the applicant did not say so in terms, a reasonable inference from his evidence is that as a result of being given morphine and Oxycontin in hospital, he had relapsed into drug use which is why he did not return to the rehabilitation centre upon his discharge.
Submissions
16The applicant submitted that the notional start point for the sentence was 4 years.  This was plainly unjust or unreasonable in the sense referred to in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25] because the notional start point was too high and resulted in a sentence which was manifestly excessive.
17The applicant submitted that the offence of knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime (s193B) was found within Pt 4AC of the Crimes Act under the heading ""Money Laundering"".  He submitted that the way in which his offence was committed was very different to what might be regarded as the usual type of offending prosecuted under this section.  This was particularly so when regard was had to the circumstances of the offence:
(a) The applicant was not part of the robbery.
(b) The decision to steal the handbag was spontaneous.
(c) His decision-making was affected by drugs and his intellectual functioning was not fully competent.
(d) The amount of money disposed of ($16,000) was considerably less than many other offences dealt with under the section.
(e) There was a significant lack of sophistication in both the stealing and disposal of the money.
18While accepting the limitation of the Judicial Commission's statistics, the applicant referred to six specific cases:  Dela Cruz v R [2010] NSWCCA 333; Sills v R [2011] NSWCCA 271; Yow v R [2010] NSWCCA 251; Youkhana v R [2013] NSWCCA 85; Ryan v R [2011] NSWCCA 250; Ali v R [2008] NSWCCA 60 as indicating factual circumstances where the offences were more serious than here, but where the sentences imposed were similar or less.  The applicant submitted that these cases demonstrated that this sentence was manifestly excessive.
Consideration
19As a matter of principle, submissions based on a small selection of cases produce a result favourable to an applicant, is not an approach which has found favour in this Court.  It is, of course, always possible to find cases which favour a particular outcome.  This selection of cases is so small that it cannot demonstrate a sentencing trend.  Each case of necessity depends upon its own particular facts and a selection of cases in this way does no more than demonstrate that a particular outcome occurred in each of the nominated cases.  A small selection of cases such as this does not and cannot demonstrate that a particular sentence was manifestly excessive.
20In the absence of any clearly defined sentencing trends, a determination of whether a particular sentence is manifestly excessive will depend very much upon the particular facts of the case and the applicability of the approach set out by the plurality (Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ) in Markarian when they said:
""25 As with other discretionary judgments, the inquiry on an appeal against sentence is identified in the well-known passage in the joint reasons of Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ in House v The King, itself an appeal against sentence. Thus is specific error shown? (Has there been some error of principle? Has the sentencer allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the decision? Have the facts been mistaken? Has the sentencer not taken some material consideration into account?) Or if specific error is not shown, is the result embodied in the order unreasonable or plainly unjust? It is this last kind of error that is usually described, in an offender's appeal, as ""manifest excess"", or in a prosecution appeal, as ""manifest inadequacy"".
...
27 Express legislative provisions apart, neither principle, nor any of the grounds of appellate review, dictates the particular path that a sentencer, passing sentence in a case where the penalty is not fixed by statute, must follow in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence to be imposed should be fixed as it is. The judgment is a discretionary judgment and, as the bases for appellate review reveal, what is required is that the sentencer must take into account all relevant considerations (and only relevant considerations) in forming the conclusion reached. As has now been pointed out more than once, there is no single correct sentence. And judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies.
28 ... As the whole Court pointed out in Lowndes v The Queen, a court of criminal appeal may not substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge merely because the appellate court would have exercised its discretion in a manner different from the manner in which the sentencing judge exercised his or her discretion.""
21In these proceedings the applicant has not sought to identify specific error.  What the applicant has sought to do is to demonstrate latent error by arguing that the sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".  The applicant has sought to achieve that result by reciting favourable findings by the sentencing judge and by reference to six cases to which reference has been made.  The difficulty with reciting the favourable findings made by the sentencing judge is that it merely emphasises that the sentencing judge clearly took those matters into account when exercising his discretion and fixing the sentence.  As his Honour correctly appreciated, this was a case where specific deterrence and general deterrence were important.  Moreover, the commission of this offence against the background of his extensive criminal record gave rise to considerations of retribution and the protection of society (Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465). 
22It is clear from a consideration of cases involving this offence, that it is an offence which may be committed by various means involving different criminality and for which no proper sentencing range can be discerned from the limited cases available.  One of the difficulties with considering cases such as the six to which the Court's attention was directed, is that where a number of offences have been committed, the principle of totality requires that restraint be exercised in fixing sentences for individual offences so as to avoid a crushing and inappropriate result.  Consequently, to look at such a sentence in isolation is of limited value.
23His Honour recognised that the offence was not one of the more serious proceeds of crime matters but in itself, it was a serious matter because the applicant by his actions deprived the owner of $16,000, having made no attempt to return the money, either that day or subsequently.  His choice not to return the bag, nor to account for any of the money, was not made on the spur of the moment but was a decision which was maintained and confirmed over the ensuing days until the balance of the monies was stolen from the caravan.
24Despite the inappropriateness of a consideration of individual cases, the particular cases to which the applicant referred to do not either individually or collectively demonstrate that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive.
25In Dela Cruz v R, the sentence for knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime was complicated by a plea of guilty to a number of fraud offences.  Questions of accumulation and totality influenced the length of the sentence.  The appeal was allowed on the basis that an additional penalty for this offence was not appropriate when account was taken of the fraud offences.  The case does not provide assistance to the applicant.
26Sills v R turns very much on its own facts.  The applicant had pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to an offence of break enter and steal committed by his sister and to knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime.  The applicant had driven his sister from the scene of a break and enter offence, given her advice as to how to avoid detection and was given some of the proceeds.  He admitted to receiving approximately $3,800.  The applicant was a former police officer, who suffered from PTSD and depression, had a gambling addiction and was serving his sentence under extremely onerous circumstances.  Because of its special and unusual facts the case provides no assistance to the applicant.
27The applicant in Yow v R pleaded guilty to 9 dishonesty offences and knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime.  There were also a number of Form 1 documents covering 33 offences.  Once again the sentence imposed in respect of the knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime was complicated by considerations of totality because of the need to take into account the dishonesty offences.  The knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime offences related to the applicant's dealing with proceeds from his own dishonesty offences involving the possession and use of counterfeit credit cards.
28Youkhana v R involved the applicant pleading guilty to knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime (being an amount of in excess of $4.5 million), doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice, giving evidence before the NSW Crime Commission which to her knowledge was false and conducting transactions so as to avoid reporting requirements.  The applicant was actively involved in efforts to hide large sums of money, the proceeds of her husband's illegal activities, and appears to have enjoyed a lavish lifestyle with the proceeds.  The sentence for knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime was complicated by the need to sentence for the other offences.
29In Ryan v R the applicant pleaded guilty to six dishonesty offences and knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime.  There were 34 offences for dishonesty on a Form 1 taken into account on sentence for the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime.  The offences involved identity theft, accessing accounts and credit cards and using stolen credit cards.  The factual basis for the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime is not specified in the decision.  No assistance is provided for the applicant by this case.
30In Ali v R the applicant pleaded guilty to knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime ($490,000), knowingly possess a false travel document, possess instruments for making false instruments, possess false instrument with intent to use, attempt to obtain credit by fraud, together with a further 10 offences to be included on a Form 1.  All sentences were concurrent, which makes an examination of the sentence for knowingly deal with the proceeds of crime quite unreliable.  This is particularly so when that offence was referable to cash found at business premises when searched by the police.
31It is clear from a consideration of only these six cases that this is an offence which may be committed by various means involving different criminality and for which no proper sentencing range can be discerned by reference to particular examples.  Where the offender's activity is limited to dealing with the proceeds of their own offences, principles of totality are particularly important because an additional penalty for the offence may not be appropriate where there is no additional criminality.  That was not the situation here. 
32In the absence of any error, either patent or latent, being established and in the absence of any error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion, this ground of appeal must fail.
33The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.
34SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
35BARR AJ:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		20 February 2014",2014-02-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705507,R v Robinson [2014] NSWCCA 12,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  The respondent, Daniel James Robinson, was sentenced by Madgwick ADCJ at Campbelltown on 21 June 2013.  He was before the Court on a charge of breaking and entering a dwelling house, committing larceny therein, in circumstances of ""special aggravation"", contrary to s 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.  It was also subject to a standard non-parole period of seven years: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 54D, Table, item 13.  The trial judge was also required to take into account a further offence of common assault, contained on a Form 1.  
2There were two persons (siblings) of Vietnamese extraction in the house at the time of the offence; the female was 19 years of age and her brother 16 years of age.  The assault involved the respondent kicking the 19 year old female occupant of the premises in the abdomen.  The circumstances of the other offending, to which it will be necessary to make more detailed reference below, were aptly described by the sentencing judge as ""really very serious ... this was a sustained rampage into violence"": Tcpt, 21/06/13, p 14(40).  The judge imposed a sentence which, prior to correction, involved a non-parole period of two years with an additional term of 18 months.  Following the midday adjournment, he corrected his calculation of the sentence, increasing the additional term to two years and three months, giving a total sentence period of four years, three months.  The calculation of the sentence included a discount of 40% on account of the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty and for assistance provided to law enforcement authorities.  The judge did not apportion this global discount between the respective purposes, or between past and future assistance.
3The Director of Public Prosecutions has appealed against the leniency of the sentence, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  The appeal is brought as of right.
4Although the sentence was backdated to commence on 5 July 2012, so that the non-parole period would expire on 4 July 2014, the actual date of sentencing was 21 June 2013.  Six weeks later, the Director filed a notice of appeal specifying manifest inadequacy as the relevant ground, but foreshadowing the possibility that further grounds would be filed later.  On 18 December 2013, the Director, somewhat belatedly, filed a document entitled ""Additional grounds of appeal"" which may be conveniently paraphrased in the following terms:
Grounds 1 and 2: failing to have regard to the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period;
Ground 3: failing to have regard to the fact that the offence was committed whilst the respondent was subject to a bond imposed for an earlier offence of personal violence;
Ground 4: failing to have regard to the significant criminal history of the respondent, including prior offences of dishonesty and personal violence; 
Ground 5: failing to increase the sentence to reflect the assault on the sister, being the offence on the Form 1;
Grounds 6, 7 and 8: with respect to the discount for assistance to law enforcement authorities:(a) imposing a lesser penalty (both as to the non-parole period and the additional term) which was ""unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence"", contrary to s 23(3) of the Sentencing Procedure Act;(b) failing to state the penalty that would otherwise have been imposed and, to the extent it involved future assistance, separately the amount by which the penalty had been reduced for past and future assistance.
Grounds 9 and 10: reasserted the manifest inadequacy of the sentence and of the non-parole period.
5Although the Director does not require leave to appeal against sentence, s 5D provides that the Court ""may in its discretion vary the sentence"", language which has long been accepted as providing a residual discretion not to intervene even if satisfied that one or more grounds for intervention has been made good.  On occasion the Court has declined to intervene because of delay on the part of the Director in giving notice to the offender of the proposed appeal.  The conduct of the prosecutor may also militate against intervention, for example where the prosecutor's submissions led to or acquiesced in an outcome said on appeal to be erroneous.  This issue arises with respect to ground 3, because a formal document entitled ""Crown Sentence Summary"" (Ex A in the sentencing proceedings), indicated that the offence was not committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty, a statement which was not corrected by the prosecutor in the course of the hearing.  
6For reasons set out below, the case is one where the manifest inadequacy of the sentence is established without the need to rely upon ground 3: the fact that the respondent was on conditional liberty at the time of the offending is a matter which this Court should take into account in resentencing the offender.
Circumstances of offending7The following account, except where expressly indicated otherwise, is taken from a statement of agreed facts, which was in evidence before the sentencing judge.  
8The offending conduct took place at 3am on Thursday 26 April 2012.  The respondent had stolen a car and had driven to the house of two associates, whom he believed to be interested in undertaking break and enters in order to obtain money for drugs.  Five young males then travelled by car to the victims' home which, according to the respondent, was targeted because it was believed to be occupied by Vietnamese people and it was believed that such houses ""tend to have gold and things like that"".  The respondent was at that stage almost 26 years of age and agreed he was the oldest of the group: Tcpt, 21/06/13, p 8(45).  The judge was informed by the prosecutor that two of the others were to be dealt with in the Children's Court and a fourth was approximately 22 years of age.  The judge asked the respondent if he had been ""the ringleader"" but the respondent said that the ringleader was ""one of the younger offenders"": Tcpt, p 9(9).  One of the co-offenders was known by the respondent to have a knife and the respondent himself had a hammer.  One male remained in the vehicle and everyone else entered the house; the four that entered had their hands covered with gloves or socks.  
9The occupants had closed the front gate and locked and secured the front door before going to bed.  They had also closed the doors of their bedrooms.  When the respondent and his associates arrived, they opened the front gate, smashed a glass window at the side of the door and reached inside to unlock it.  The respondent said that ""the group started 'ransacking' the lounge room, ... he didn't care that they were making noise and would wake up people in the house"".  They searched the unoccupied bedroom of the owner and took a black wallet containing cash, some assorted foreign currency and personal items made with gold.  The respondent then entered the bedroom of the female occupant who awoke to see the offender standing inside her bedroom with another man holding a knife standing outside the door in the hallway; she got up.  The respondent yelled at her to ""Give me all your money"" and, when she stated she did not have any money, he kicked her in the stomach causing her to fall back onto the bed.  The respondent then took a number of personal items including a laptop computer.  She observed that the respondent was wearing gloves.
10The respondent and a co-offender then forced entry into the bedroom occupied by the brother, whereupon the respondent produced the hammer, walked up to the brother and hit him on the right side of the forehead, causing a laceration near the right eyebrow from which the young man started to bleed.  The brother then got out of bed, ran behind the respondent, wrapped his arms around him and pushed him to the ground.  The co-offender then came into the bedroom and said ""Where's all the money?"" while pointing a knife at the brother.  The brother did not answer, but the co-offender grabbed a backpack, removed a small amount of cash and left.
11The respondent then got up and started to run out of the bedroom, but the brother grabbed him by the jacket.  The respondent broke free but the brother chased him down the hallway, grabbed him and started hitting him with his fists.  The two struggled from the hallway into the lounge room, at which point the sister came out of her bedroom and followed them into the lounge room.  A fight then ensued with the brother smashing a wooden bar stool over the respondent's head.  His associate with the knife was still in the room, and at some stage stabbed the brother in the right shoulder.  The associate then ran out of the front door as did another co-offender.  The brother and sister continued to belabour the respondent on the floor with furniture and fists.  However the respondent managed to grab the brother again and struck him on the right cheek with the hammer before the brother took possession of the hammer and threw it on the ground.  While this was occurring, the respondent lost one of his gloves.  He then started to run out of the house, yelling for help, pursued by the occupants.  He eventually made it to the car driven by a co-offender and escaped from the scene.  Police and an ambulance were called, and the brother was taken to hospital for treatment of the stab wound in his shoulder.  
12An ambulance was also called to the premises to which the offenders had driven after the robbery, to attend to the respondent's injuries.  When questioned by ambulance officers, the respondent stated ""repeatedly"" that he had ""slipped on wet grass"".  That implausible story was repeated to police.  The respondent was later linked to the crime as a result of DNA swabs taken from the glove recovered from the lounge room floor, where it had been lost during the fight.
13The respondent was arrested on 5 July 2012.  He gave an interview to police in which he admitted going to the house which was broken into.  He named three of his associates, but said that the name of the fifth male was unknown to him.  He denied getting out of the car at any stage during the commission of the offences.  When asked to explain the presence of his DNA on the glove, he stated that ""someone else might have used his gloves"".
14By 15 April 2013, but at a time which is unclear from the materials before this Court, the respondent changed his story.  On 30 January 2013 he entered a plea to the offence for which he has been sentenced.  On 8 April 2013 he was interviewed by a psychologist instructed by his solicitor, to whom a copy of a statement of facts had been provided.  On 15 April 2013 (more than two months after the plea) police conducted a second recorded interview with the respondent.  The statement of agreed facts supplied to the Court was dated 20 June 2013.  
15At the sentencing hearing on 21 June 2013 only the respondent gave evidence; he was not cross-examined.  
Grounds 1 and 2: failure to refer to penalties16The Director submitted that ""[t]he prescribed maximum penalty is such an important consideration in the determination of sentence that it must invariably be referred to and considered explicitly in the course of the reasons for sentence.""
17While it is common practice in recent times to refer to the maximum penalty for an offence in a judgment on sentence, that has not always been so.  Where there is no realistic suggestion that an offender should receive the maximum penalty, or anything like it, the mere failure to refer to the maximum penalty is unlikely to demonstrate error.  In R v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534; 117 A Crim R 497, at [72] Howie J (with whom Fitzgerald JA agreed) referred to a failure on the part of the sentencing judge to refer ""to the maximum penalty current at the time of the offences or the nature of the conduct which came within the scope of the offence with which the applicant was charged"".  He said that those omissions ""would not normally indicate error"", but that a different view should be taken in a case where the offences had been committed some 30 years earlier at a time when both the scope of the offence and the maximum penalty were different.  That is not this case: the mere failure to refer to the prescribed maximum penalty did not constitute error.
18A different view might be taken of the failure to refer to the standard non-parole period.  The Sentencing Procedure Act requires that, for an offence to which a standard non-parole period is prescribed, the Court ""is to set"" the standard non-parole period, ""unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter"": s 54B(2).  That section further provides that the Court ""must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period"" and ""must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account"": s 54B(4).  There is no obligation to fix the standard non-parole period in any particular case: Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 at [24]-[25].  Further, a failure to comply with the requirements as to reasons does not invalidate the sentence: s 54B(5).  Nevertheless, such a failure may lead to an inference that the trial judge did not give proper consideration to the guidance provided by the standard non-parole period, or departed from it without adequate reason.  
19Generally, reasons for judgment should be capable of being understood without reference to the transcript or submissions made to the Court.  However, in the present case the judgment was delivered orally immediately after a discussion between the sentencing judge and counsel in which it is clear that the judge was working through ideas.  Further, in his judgment (at p 7) he himself returned to the earlier discussion stating:
""As I said in the course of argument, were he convicted after a trial, I should think that a total sentence of not less than seven years would be appropriate.""
20The particular exchange referred to was in the following terms (Ms Kable appearing for the offender):
""HIS HONOUR:  Yes.  It's a very savage affair, savage and desperate and completely uncaring. ...
And planned and they were ready for violence and didn't [care] if they were interrupted and so on.  Very nasty.  I think if he'd been convicted after a trial, he'd be looking at a head sentence of seven years.
KABLE:  There is a standard non-parole period of seven years, of course -
HIS HONOUR:  I'm not worried about the non-parole period, I'm talking about a head sentence.
KABLE:  Right.""
21Counsel for the respondent emphasised the need to avoid ""two stage reasoning"" in identifying an appropriate sentence.  One must, of course, address the issues in an orderly fashion, but the risks of identifying a ""starting point"" from which to make deductions is illustrated by this case.  Thus, it is by no means clear what factors the trial judge took into account in reaching a starting point of seven years as an appropriate penalty in the event of a conviction following a trial.  Immediately prior to that statement, the following factors were identified:
""He pleaded guilty at the earliest possible time and the extent of his assistance is very considerable and valuable.  I believe that his expression of remorse in relation to the victims and his own entire criminal lifestyle is sincere.  I think that he should be entitled to a discount of forty percent.""
22The discount allowed for an early plea reflects its ""utilitarian value""; it does not include the mitigating element of remorse: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1, at [32](3) (Howie J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing).  It is likely that in reaching a figure of seven years as a starting point, the sentencing judge had taken into account what he described as ""the seriousness of the intent and violence involved"" and, elsewhere, as ""the complete turnaround on the part of the prisoner"": judgment, p 6.
23Immediately before the statement set out above, however, the sentencing judge had noted that by providing assistance to the police the offender was ""putting himself at serious risk, both in gaol and when he gets out, and he will probably need to live a long way from Sydney when he is released"": judgment, p 6.  Whether this factor was taken into account in calculating the seven year starting point is unclear: if that occurred, there would appear to be a double counting in the reduction, as the discount for assistance is intended to reflect the hardship likely to be suffered by an offender in the circumstances of his custody: R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66; 221 A Crim R 63 at [146] (RS Hulme J, Hall J agreeing).  
24As discussed below, the imposition of a lesser penalty on account of a guilty plea need not, but frequently does, give rise to a statement as to the proportionate reduction.  Such a practice not only promotes transparency, but demonstrates whether or not the Court has given effect to the principles established in the guideline judgment, R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.  With respect to a lesser penalty imposed on account of assistance provided to law enforcement authorities, the Sentencing Procedure Act now requires that the judge state the penalty which would otherwise have been imposed: s 23(4)(b).  As a result, it is common practice to identify a starting point, which should be (unless otherwise indicated) the sentence which would have been imposed were it not for the matters which properly form elements of the proposed discounting.  
25The mitigating factors in the present case, to which the sentencing judge gave significant weight, were:(a) the expression of remorse with respect to the consequences of the offending on the victims;(b) the expressed intention to abandon a previous life of drug taking, property offences and violence, and(c) the provision of assistance to law enforcement authorities.There can be no doubt, however, that these factors overlapped.  Separating out their effects, for the purposes of determining a sentence and a discount is an exercise fraught with difficulty.  Thus, for example, the starting point could properly be assessed at a lower level than otherwise where there is a finding of genuine remorse and a commitment to change one's lifestyle, thus reducing the need for personal deterrence and improving the prospects of rehabilitation.
26Uncertainty as to whether the sentencing judge approached the case in the required manner is compounded by the failure to identify the operation of the standard non-parole period and give reasons for departing from it.
27The standard non-parole period was said to represent the non-parole period for an offence ""in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"": s 54A(2).  (This provision has been amended, but that was the language as at the time of sentencing.)  The sentencing judge expressed on several occasions a view of the objective seriousness of the offence, in terms consistent with the offence falling within the middle of the range.  If the standard non-parole period were to be imposed, and putting to one side a finding of ""special circumstances"", which allowed the sentencing judge to depart from the proportion as between the non-parole period and the total sentence, identified in s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, the appropriate ""head sentence"" would be nine years, three months.  
28The purpose of such calculations is not to suggest that the sentencing judge should necessarily have reasoned in this way, but merely to demonstrate that the sentencing judge may have departed from the standard non-parole period (which he was undoubtedly entitled to do) without having proper regard to it.  As the High Court stated in Muldrock at [29], ""[a] central purpose of Div 1A is to require sentencing judges to state fully the reasons for arriving at the sentence imposed.""
29The Court continued at [30]:
""The full statement of reasons for the specification of non-parole periods either higher or lower than the standard assists appellate review and in this way promotes consistency in sentencing for Div 1A offences.  It may also increase public awareness of the sentencing process.""
30The significance of the standard non-parole period in the present case also required consideration as a guidepost when assessing whether the discounts resulted in a penalty which was ""unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence"", for the purposes of ss 22 and 23 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  It will be necessary to return to these provisions below.
Ground 3: failure to advert to bond31It is an aggravating factor that an offence is committed whilst the offender is on conditional liberty in relation to another offence: s 21A(2)(j).  It is not in doubt that the respondent was subject to a good behaviour bond under s 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, imposed on 20 December 2011, for an assault.  The bond was for a period of 12 months, and was therefore current at the time of the further offending in April 2012.  The ""Crown Sentence Summary"" prepared by the prosecution and placed before the sentencing court not only failed to refer to the bond, but expressly stated that the offence had not been committed whilst the offender was on bail, bond or parole.  On the other hand, the fact that he was on a bond at the relevant time was expressly identified in the pre-sentence report and in the copy of the respondent's criminal record (p 23), both of which were before the sentencing judge.  
32It may be accepted that the sentencing judge did not take this matter into account, as it was not drawn to his attention, nor was it referred to in the judgment.  It is not a matter which the Director should be entitled to rely upon as demonstrating error, but it may be taken into account by this Court if error is otherwise established, warranting the Court's intervention: R v Amohanga and Rai [2005] NSWCCA 249; 155 A Crim R 202 at [119]-[120] (Simpson J).  
Ground 4: failure to take criminal history into account33That the respondent had an extensive criminal record, including offences involving personal violence, robbery and breaking and entering homes, cannot be gainsaid.  His first conviction was in the Bidura Childrens Court when he was 13 years of age.  On 4 March 2003 he was sentenced in the District Court at Parramatta to three years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months for robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon and causing wounding (grievous bodily harm).  The Director submitted that this record required that substantial additional weight be given to retribution, deterrence and the protection of society, referring to R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at [26] (Spigelman CJ).
34The proposition that the sentencing judge did not take the prior criminal record into account at all cannot be sustained.  He noted in the judgment that the respondent ""was involved in drug taking and crime for many years"": p 2.  The judge continued:
""He ceased formal education in Year 7 but he was sentenced to juvenile detention for three years with an eighteen months non-parole period when he was fifteen for a crime of violence and dishonesty committed when he was fourteen.""
35The judge referred to the respondent being ""a poly-drug addict on almost an heroic scale"" (p 3), and, in a phrase already noted, referred to the respondent's ""criminal lifestyle"": p 7.  
36The manner in which the sentencing judge addressed this material is clear from the passage in which he noted that the respondent ""was remanded in custody from [the date of his arrest] and once he had, as it were, dried out from the drugs and the alcohol he seems to have undergone a complete sea change in his attitude to matters"" (p 5) and, in his second interview in April 2013, ""he appears to have told the police the truth, including admitting his own very disgraceful part in the appalling affair"": p 6.
37In concluding that the respondent had undergone a ""sea change"" and a ""complete turnaround"", the judge considered that he was realistic about his future and ""volunteered that he will need long term residential rehabilitation upon his release"": pp 6-7.  Without making any finding as to the prospects of rehabilitation, the judge noted that ""his rehabilitation, despite his own genuine good intentions and realism, will nevertheless be difficult and he needs an extensive period of supervised liberty in the community while on parole"": p 7.  
38The Director was on firmer ground in submitting that inadequate weight was given to the prior offending.  A prior criminal record is sometimes identified as a reason for not according any leniency on the basis that the criminal offending was an aberration from an otherwise lawful lifestyle, or as demonstrating a greater need for personal deterrence and protection of society.  However, if the assessment made by the trial judge of the respondent's character were accepted, these considerations would carry less weight than they otherwise might.  The assessment made by the sentencing judge was generous to the respondent: however, the judge had some (perhaps limited) advantage of seeing the respondent give evidence (briefly) and it is not appropriate for this Court to reconsider that assessment.  The Court should not intervene on this ground.
Ground 5: failure to take the Form 1 offence into account39The difficulty for the Director in making good this ground is that the sentencing judge expressly stated that he took into account the matter on the Form 1, being ""the assault constituted by the gratuitous kicking of the female victim"": p 7.  That offence, as was emphasised by counsel for the respondent, was a ""common assault"" (being an assault not occasioning actual bodily harm); nevertheless, it carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment.  The circumstances of the assault required that it be reflected in a moderate increase in the assessment of the seriousness of the offending involved in the principal charge.  How it was taken into account is by no means clear, although these are not matters which can be identified with precision.  Taken on its own, this ground does not form a basis for intervention.
Grounds 6, 7 and 8: discount for assistance40Each of grounds 6 and 7 complained that the sentencing judge had failed to follow the steps required by s 23(3) of the Sentencing Procedure Act because the sentence imposed (constituted by the non-parole period and the additional term) was ""unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence"".  This ground is no more than a complaint of manifest inadequacy.  It does not require separate attention from grounds 9 and 10 discussed below.
41Ground 8 complained that the judge had failed to state the amount by which the penalty had been reduced, on the assumption that it covered both past and future assistance, to reflect that assistance: see s 23(4)(c).
42While a sentence imposed which fails to comply with the requirements of s 23(4) will not be invalid for that reason, compliance remains an important legal obligation of the sentencing court.  The primary reason for the obligation is that, if the offender fails to fulfil an undertaking as to future assistance, the Director may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal to have the sentence reduced: Criminal Appeal Act, s 5DA.  It is important that this Court be in a position to act with full information as to the extent of the discount given with respect to future assistance.  On the other hand, failure by the trial judge to comply with the apportionment obligation will not usually indicate that the sentence was either too high or too low.  If the Court is to resentence, it will comply with the obligation under s 23(4); it will not intervene merely because there has been a breach of s 23(4).
Grounds 9 and 10: manifest inadequacy43Taking into account the foregoing discussion, the Director has made good one specific basis for challenging the sentence imposed below, namely that the trial judge did not give adequate consideration to the guidepost provided by the standard non-parole period.  However, even that aspect is best considered as an element of manifest inadequacy.  
44Guideposts as to an appropriate penalty are provided by the maximum available penalty (imprisonment for 25 years) and the standard non-parole period (seven years).  In relation to this offence, the standard non-parole period, representing the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without taking into account circumstances relevant to the offender as opposed to the offence, is consistent with a sentence having a full term of a little under 50% of the maximum penalty.  
45As explained in Muldrock at [25], it is not necessary for the Court to undertake an assessment of whether the offence is within ""the midrange of objective seriousness"".  However, some assessment of objective seriousness is necessary and in the course of submissions the sentencing judge said that ""if he'd been convicted after a trial I'd have thought the matter was a mid-range offence"" Tcpt, p 16(35).  (The trial judge referred in his judgment (p 7) to ""the very great, indeed horrifying, seriousness of his crime"", language which involves an element of hyperbole.)  The elements demonstrating the seriousness of the offending included:(a) when (3am) and where (a private home) the offence as committed;(b) the fact that four males entered the house;(c) the respondent being armed with an offensive weapon (a hammer) and a co-offender being armed, to the respondent's knowledge, with a knife;(d) the infliction of actual bodily harm by hitting an occupant on the head on two occasions with the hammer;(e) the ""ransacking"" of rooms;(f) entering the bedrooms of sleeping occupants and assaulting the occupants, and(g) the larcenous removal (and attempted removal) of cash and valuables.
46The trial judge accepted that there would be ""justifiable community outrage"" if the respondent received ""anything less than two years as a minimum term"".  That opinion should be accepted.  However, to say that a minimum term of less than two years would be unequivocally disproportionate to the seriousness of the offending is not to say that a penalty of two years is proportionate to the criminality involved.
47So far as the circumstances of the offender are concerned, two were favourable, one neutral and one unfavourable.  The first favourable circumstances were that the respondent had a sad and disrupted childhood.  As the sentencing judge fairly remarked, ""[h]e grew up, it would be wrong to say he was brought up, in awful circumstances"".  That he fell into drug taking and crime at an early age was, again as the sentencing judge remarked, unsurprising.  The respondent's history undoubtedly evokes significant sympathy and compassion.  
48How such matters are to be weighed against the circumstances of a particular crime was considered recently in Western Australia v Munda [2012] WASCA 164; 43 WAR 137 and, on appeal, by the High Court in Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38; 87 ALJR 1035.  Mr Munda was sentenced for the manslaughter of his de facto wife.  In the Court of Appeal, McClure P had observed, in a passage quoted with approval in the joint reasons in the High Court at [43]:
""Even if it is established that a person's addiction to alcohol and/or drugs is mitigatory because of events in their formative childhood years or otherwise, that does not inevitably reduce the weight to be given to personal deterrence.  Indeed, addictions ordinarily increase the weight to be given to personal deterrence (and/or community protection) because of the associated increase in the risk of reoffending.  ...  Further, the courts must exercise caution in characterising or treating an offender as a 'victim' because it can lead adult perpetrators to wrongly believe that they are not truly responsible and accountable for their conduct, leading to a failure to properly protect the community. ...
Moreover, it is wrong in principle to reduce the weight to be given to general deterrence in circumstances where alcohol-fuelled violence is endemic in the community generally, even if not sufficiently deterred in fact by the prospect of imprisonment.""
49The comments of McClure P with respect to personal deterrence were approved by the High Court at [57].  With respect to general deterrence and protection of the community, the joint reasons noted at [54]:
""First, the proper role of the criminal law is not limited to the utilitarian value of general deterrence.  The criminal law is more than a mode of social engineering which operates by providing disincentives directed to reducing unacceptably deviant behaviour within the community.  To view the criminal law exclusively, or even principally, as a mechanism for the regulation of the risks of deviant behaviour is to fail to recognise the long-standing obligation of the state to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence, to express the community's disapproval of that offending, and to afford such protection as can be afforded by the state to the vulnerable against repetition of violence.""
50These sentiments suggest that, in the present case, some, but limited weight, can be given to the deprived background of the respondent and its likely effect in contributing to his anti-social behaviour.
51The second finding of the trial judge, which weighs more heavily in favour of leniency, is the acceptance of his change in attitude.  Remorse is always a potentially mitigating factor, if genuine, because it reflects an acceptance of moral culpability and improves the chances of rehabilitation.  Nevertheless, it does not necessarily diminish the importance of continuing personal deterrence, nor the need to affirm the community's disapprobation of such conduct, in defence of the individual rights of the victims.
52The neutral factor is the likelihood of rehabilitation.  The ability of (experienced) judges to assess whether severity or leniency will lead to reform, at a particular point in a particular individual's life, may be doubted, particularly in circumstances where the basis for such a judgment is quite limited.  The sentencing judge understandably made no predictions beyond stating that the respondent's rehabilitation, despite his good intentions, would be difficult.  
53The main negative factor in the background of the respondent was his criminal history.  No doubt the weight that should be given to that factor is lessened by the circumstances of his disadvantageous upbringing, but it precludes leniency based on previous good character or classification of the offending as out of character.
54Some part of the penalty must also reflect the offence on the Form 1, not because a penalty is being imposed for that offence, but because, taking that offence into account, the sentence should be increased: Abbas v R [2013] NSWCCA 115 at [22] (Bathurst CJ). 
55For completeness, it should be noted that the respondent, in resisting a complaint that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, placed reliance upon the observations of King CJ in R v Osenkowski (1983) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213; (1982) 5 A Crim R 394 at 394, which have been referred to with approval on more than one occasion in this Court and which are relevant to the residual discretion:
""It is important that prosecution appeals should not be allowed to circumscribe unduly the sentencing discretion of judges.  There must always be a place for the exercise of mercy where a judge's sympathies are reasonably excited by the circumstances of the case.  There must always be a place for the leniency which has traditionally been extended even to offenders with bad records when the judge forms the view, almost intuitively in the case of experienced judges, that leniency at that particular stage of the offender's life might lead to reform.  The proper role for prosecution appeals, in my view, is to enable to the courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime, to enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crime to be corrected, and occasionally to correct a sentence which is so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience.""
56The importance of maintaining a degree of flexibility should be recognised.  However, the combined effect of the objective features of the offending and the circumstances of the offender is that the sentence in this case was manifestly inadequate.  The next question is what, if any, variation should be made by this Court.
Residual discretion57Delay on the part of a prosecuting authority in seeking a remedy for what is believed to be an inadequate sentence is always a relevant factor in determining whether the court should intervene to correct inadequacy once established.  In the present case, the Director gave prompt notice of his intention, even though a period of six months was allowed to pass between the date of sentence and the date on which the appellant's submissions were filed, providing a detailed basis for the alleged errors.
58Given the early notification, the lapse of time is not undue.  However, a further consideration in the present case is that the non-parole period of two years was backdated to commence almost a year before the sentencing hearing and is due to expire on 4 July 2014.  That is a factor which would call for greater expedition than was achieved in the present case.  Nevertheless, the respondent does not complain of delay and, given the early indication of intention, the Court should not decline to intervene on this basis.
59The primary consideration relied upon by the respondent as militating against intervention was the failure of the prosecutor to indicate to the sentencing judge that a minimum term of two years would be inadequate.
60It is true that the advocate appearing for the Director on the sentencing hearing adopted a somewhat passive stance.  She did not cross-examine the respondent in relation to what the sentencing judge was to describe as a ""sea change"" in his attitude, although it is possible that she had simply not discerned in his evidence any suggestion of such a change.  It was also true that she did not take issue with the suggestion that, after trial, he would be looking at a head sentence of seven years.  On the other hand, that may have been because the advocate for the offender had immediately pointed out that seven years was the standard non-parole period, with the implicit suggestion that this might not indicate a seven year head sentence as appropriate.  The prosecutor did seek to dissent from the judge's suggestion that a discount of 25% should be allowed for the early plea, although it appears that that occurred in the course of answering a question from the judge whilst the respondent's advocate was still addressing him.  By the time she had finished, the judge had already expressed the view that there would have to be a total discount of 40% from the seven year sentence on which he appeared already to have fixed his mind.  When asked to respond to the proposition that it would be ""an outrage if he didn't serve two years as a non-parole period"" the prosecutor did not wish to be heard.  However, it is unclear whether that was because  what she understood was being proposed was the appropriate non-parole period or, as seems more likely, the very bottom of the appropriate range.
61By the time he had reached that point, it appears that the sentencing judge treated the submissions as concluded.  Having made his statement about what would be an outrage, he interrupted the respondent's advocate to ask ""Do you want to be heard?""  She replied that she did not want to be heard ""on that"" and the prosecutor merely said ""No your Honour"", which may have been intended as agreement that she did not wish to be heard on that particular point.  No further submissions were made.
62It is undoubtedly unfortunate that the prosecutor was not more assertive.  In effect, she was never invited to make submissions at all.  Apart from answering two questions from the Court as to the circumstances of the plea, and the appropriate discount, together with some further questions concerning the nature of the assistance provided, she was not offered the opportunity and did not seek to address on any other issue.  That said, the brief transcript indicates that the respondent's advocate also had little opportunity to develop  coherent submissions.
63This is not a case in which it can be said that the sentencing judge was led into error by the conduct of the prosecution (except with respect to the currency of the bond at the time of the offending).  Rather, it is a case where the prosecutor failed to insist upon her right to be heard.  These circumstances do not require the Court, in the exercise of its residual discretion, to allow a manifestly inadequate sentence to stand.  The public interest in the proper administration of criminal justice requires that the Court intervene.
Variation of sentence64In resentencing the respondent, consideration should be given to the matters discussed above, including the fact that the respondent was at large on conditional liberty at the time of the offending.  There was no challenge to the discount of 40% for the combined effect of the plea and the assistance to law enforcement authorities, but the Director did submit that if the effect of applying the discount were to reduce the minimum term to two years and the additional term to two years, three months, the result was an inadequate sentence.  Whether that conclusion is given effect by treating the starting point of seven years adopted by the trial judge as inadequate, or mitigating the effect of the discount is, so long as the discount is adequately identified, immaterial.
65In all the circumstances, an adequate sentence of imprisonment required a minimum term of three years and an additional term of two years three months, giving a sentence of five years three months imprisonment.  That sentence (63 months) approximates the result (rounded down) of applying a 40% discount to a starting point of nine years.  A significantly more severe sentence would have been warranted were it not for the finding of the trial judge that the respondent is sincere in his expression of remorse and genuine in his wish to lead a different lifestyle.  The likely period of supervised liberty is that imposed by the sentencing judge.  It is a significant period: however, supervision will not assist unless the respondent retains a steadfast determination to abide by his newly found principles.
66In the present case, the element of protection required by the respondent may well make it difficult for him to obtain access to the kinds of programs otherwise available to inmates to help with anger management and recourse to drugs, identified by the psychologist as requiring attention.  That is reflected in the discount for assistance.  It is quite likely that the respondent will not be required to give evidence in the future:  nevertheless the possibility permits the discount for assistance (being 15%) being apportioned as to 10% for past assistance and 5% for the future.
Orders67The Court should make the following orders:
(1) Allow the appeal and set aside the sentence imposed on the respondent in the District Court on 21 June 2013.
(2) Sentence the respondent to a non-parole period of 3 years with an additional term of 2 years 3 months, to date from 5 July 2012.
The respondent will be eligible for conditional release on 4 July 2015.  His sentence will expire on 4 October 2017.
68HIDDEN J:  I agree that this appeal should be allowed.  I am content to do so on the basis that the sentence is manifestly inadequate, without considering the other grounds argued by the Crown.
69No doubt his Honour was entitled to afford considerable weight to the respondent's subjective case.  However, making all due allowance for that material, I am satisfied that the sentence fails to recognise the gravity of the criminality embraced by the principal offence and the matter on the form 1.  I agree that there is no basis on which this court should exercise its residual discretion.
70It should be recorded that counsel for the respondent relied upon the decision of this court in R v Dole and Nguyen [2010] NSWCCA 101.  That was a successful Crown appeal against a sentence for an offence of breaking and entering in circumstances of special aggravation, also arising from a home invasion, in which this court substituted a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 months.  However, that case turned on its own facts and the circumstances of the offence, as well as the respondents' subjective cases, were significantly different from the present case.  It provides no guidance to the outcome here.
71I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA.
72RS HULME AJ:  I agree.

2705511,Morton v R [2014] NSWCCA 8,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceOn 4 June 2012 the applicant pleaded guilty to one count that between 20 - 26 June 2010 he did knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely cocaine, contrary to the provisions of s25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 15 years.
2A further charge of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug (cocaine) was taken into account on a Form 1 and a related driving offence was dealt with pursuant to a certificate under s166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
3On 10 December 2012 the applicant was sentenced by English DCJ to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 6 December 2012 and expiring 5 December 2014, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 5 December 2016.
4By Notice of Appeal dated 29 October 2013 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence on the following grounds:
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the discount for the plea of guilty.
Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in the application of the principles of parity of sentencing.
Ground 3 - The sentence was manifestly excessive.
Factual Background
5In early June 2010 NSW Police established a strike force relating to the supply of prohibited drugs in the Surry Hills area of Sydney.  As a result of that investigation, Michael Bursach was identified as a person of interest.  A telephone intercept warrant was granted over a mobile telephone service used by Bursach.  Police also conducted physical surveillance of Bursach.  As a result, the applicant, Michael Moskvin and Andrew Mrowiec were also identified as persons of interest.
6The first act of supply occurred on 19 - 20 June 2010.  This was the subject of the Form 1 offence.  Bursach arranged for Mrowiec to transport 5 ounces of cocaine (140 grams) to an unidentified purchaser in Brisbane.  The applicant gave Bursach the purchaser's details.  The applicant discussed the quantity and price with the purchaser.  When the applicant was in Queensland, he tried to secure payment for the supply of that 5 ounces of cocaine.
7Telephone intercepts of conversations between Bursach and the applicant on 14, 18 and 19 June made it clear that arrangements were being made between Bursach and the applicant to deliver cocaine to a person in Brisbane and that a price had been negotiated.  Subsequent conversations made it clear that the applicant was in Brisbane and was trying to collect monies for the supply of the 5 ounces of cocaine which took place on 19-20 June.
8The second act of supply occurred on 25 June 2010 when police stopped Mrowiec as he was travelling north along the Pacific Highway.  A search of his vehicle located two brown paper bags, under the driver's seat.  Each contained a yellow serviette wrapped around a large resealable bag, inside of which were four further plastic bags containing white powder.  The applicant's telephone number was found in the vehicle, recorded in a handwritten note.  The white powder was subsequently found to be 8 ounces of cocaine (222.5 grams) with varying purity between 51.5 percent and 56.5 percent.  This amount exceeded the ""indictable quantity"" of 5 grams, but was less than the ""commercial quantity"" of 250 grams.
9Between 20 and 26 June 2010 a number of phone conversations took place between the applicant and Bursach which made it clear that the applicant was aware of a purchaser in Brisbane for the 8 ounces of cocaine and that he would make himself available as a contact person for Mrowiec, who was to transport the 8 ounces of cocaine to Queensland.  The conversations between the applicant and Bursach made it clear that the applicant knew all the details of the transaction, including the price to be paid for the cocaine.
10The applicant was arrested in August 2010.  He declined to be interviewed and was in custody for 4 days.  He was granted bail on 13 August 2010 and at the time of sentence, had been on bail for 2 years, initially reporting daily which was reduced to twice weekly and then once weekly.
Remarks on sentence
11The applicant did not give evidence.  Her Honour reviewed his subjective case as follows.  He was aged 55 when the offences were committed and was 57 at the time of sentence.  His criminal record included convictions for break enter and steal, false pretences, common assault and two high range drink driving offences.  However, his last conviction was recorded in 2005.  Her Honour found that his criminal antecedents did not disentitle him to leniency.
12The applicant was married with one child and was said to be a devoted father, grandfather and husband.  He supported an elderly mother in a nursing home.  His family were very supportive of him.
13His employment history was that of an unskilled or semi-skilled labourer.  In recent years, he had been unemployed.  He suffered from obesity and health problems.  These included trigeminal neuralgia (satisfactorily medicated), lymphedema in his lower limbs (requiring the drainage of excess fluid on occasions) and liver disease from alcohol abuse.  The applicant did not use illicit drugs.
14The applicant provided voluntary services to the community.  He was said to assist the Salvation Army and the Starlight Foundation.  In a letter written to the court, the applicant expressed his regret at becoming involved in the offences and his remorse and contrition, having regard to the harm that drugs cause to the community.  He sought to explain his involvement in the offences as in part due to financial hardship.  
15Her Honour then made a series of findings in relation to the offending.  She determined a custodial penalty was required because it was necessary to acknowledge specific deterrence and general deterrence in relation to the distribution of illicit drugs into the community.  The offending on this occasion was objectively more serious because it was done for financial gain.  She noted that the applicant was not a user dealer engaging in crime to support his habit, but also that he was not involved in other forms of criminal activity normally associated with drug supply.
16In relation to the applicant's role, her Honour found that his involvement was at a much greater level than that of Mr Mrowiec, who was merely a courier.  She found that the applicant was actively involved in facilitating the supply of a significant quantity of cocaine of a relatively high purity purely for financial gain.  She found that he was an essential link in the dissemination of the drugs to Queensland on two occasions in such circumstances that his moral culpability was of a reasonably high order for offences of this kind.  Her Honour reached this conclusion based on the intercepted telephone calls, his travel to Brisbane, his use of a mobile phone obtained with false details and his acceptance of $2,000 in payment for his involvement.
17Her Honour considered that the issue of parity did not arise because his co-offenders had very different roles in the offending.  In relation to his plea of guilty, her Honour said:
""This offender, unlike his co-offenders, did not enter his plea in the Local Court.  It was entered in the District Court.  It was entered after the matter had been listed for trial and in those circumstances I find the utilitarian value is lessened and I allow a 15% discount for his plea.""
18Her Honour found the applicant to be truly remorseful and contrite.  She thought that it was highly unlikely that he would re-offend and that he had excellent prospects for rehabilitation.
19Her Honour made a finding of special circumstances because the applicant was in poor health and as a result, his time in custody would be more onerous.  In that regard, her Honour noted that it had been many years since he was last imprisoned.  
20Her Honour took into account the Form 1 matter and noted that the penalty to be imposed had to reflect its seriousness.  Her Honour gave the applicant credit for the 4 days which he had spent in custody before being granted bail.
Ground 1 - The sentencing judge erred in the assessment of the discount for the plea of guilty.
21In order to understand the submissions relating to this ground, it is necessary to set out some further background material.
22The applicant's plea of guilty on 4 June 2012 occurred after protracted plea negotiations.  The applicant had initially been charged with two counts of supplying a prohibited drug.  On 29 April 2011 he made an offer to the DPP that the primary supply count be amended to knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug and that the secondary supply offence (the Form 1 matter) be withdrawn.
23The DPP replied on 20 June 2011 rejecting that proposal but offering to accept a plea of guilty to the primary supply count with the secondary supply count to be withdrawn and replaced with a count of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug being at least 5 grams but no more than 5 ounces of cocaine, this count to be dealt with on a Form 1.
24The applicant did not accept that proposal and on 22 June 2011 made a counter proposal that the primary supply count be reduced to a count of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug.  He indicated his acceptance that the secondary supply count be reduced to a count of knowingly take part in the supply of a prohibited drug and that this be dealt with on a Form 1 with the proviso that the quantity of cocaine be specified as 5 grams.
25On 22 June 2011 the following response was received from the DPP.
""I note that the difference between the respective positions at this stage is essentially that your offer with respect to sequence 1 reflects a charge of knowingly take part in, as distinct from an actual supply; and with respect to sequence 3 the quantity concerned is accepted as being 5 grams as distinct from being a question of fact for the sentencing judge as to whether the quantity is 5 grams or 5 ounces (as contended by the Crown).
We are not prepared to accept an offer in the terms you propose.  The offer made on 20 June 2011 is our current position.""
26On 23 June 2011 the following email was sent on behalf of the applicant to the DPP:
""I note that the offer made by you in your email of 20 June 2011 is your current position.  I am therefore instructed to request for the matter to proceed by way of a waiver of committal hearing when the matter is listed at the Central Local Court on 23 June 2011.""
27The applicant was committed for trial from the Central Local Court to the Sydney District Court on 23 June 2011 in relation to the following offences:
""Supply of a prohibited drug, namely 222.5 grams of cocaine.
Supply of a prohibited drug, namely 140 grams of cocaine.""
The applicant's matter was listed for trial on 14 May 2012 and on 3 September 2012.
28That material was placed before her Honour in the sentence proceedings.  Counsel then appearing for the applicant submitted that the ""utilitarian value of the plea of guilty by the offender should be considered to be in the range of between 15 percent and 20 percent, having regard to the nature and content of the protracted plea negotiations"".
29The applicant submitted that the plea of guilty entered by him on 4 June 2012, which was accepted by the Crown, was in the same terms insofar as the charges were concerned as the offer made on his behalf on 22 June 2011.  He accepted that in his guilty plea insofar as the Form 1 matter was concerned, the quantity of cocaine was agreed at 140 grams, which was different to the 5 grams which he had proposed in the offer.  The applicant submitted that this made no difference to the substance of the offer in that it was open to the Crown to accept it, as they ultimately did, but to reserve the factual argument as to the quantity of cocaine for hearing by the sentencing judge.  In those circumstances, the applicant submitted a full discount of 25 percent should have been allowed to him.
30The applicant submitted that he should not be bound by the submissions made by his counsel in the sentencing proceedings since those submissions were wrong.  This was because the applicant would have received a 25 percent discount had his offer of 22 June 2011 been accepted as it should have been.  The applicant submitted that the Crown's refusal to accept the offer which he had made was something beyond his control and that he should not be penalised because of the conduct of the Crown.  The applicant submitted that to find otherwise would mean that the measure of leniency afforded to an offender prepared to plead guilty to a lesser charge fairly available on the evidence would depend on the Crown's attitude.  The applicant submitted that such an approach should not be endorsed by this Court (R v Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15 at [21]).
31The applicant submitted that the matter being listed for trial in the District Court was due solely to the conduct of the Crown.
Consideration
32The applicant's submission should not be upheld.  It is based on an incorrect understanding of R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383.  This is clear from the analysis of Howie J (with whom Hoeben J agreed) in R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56 where his Honour said:
""8  The Judge imposed the sentences on the basis that the plea of guilty was made at the first reasonable opportunity and gave the applicant the benefit of a discount of 25 per cent although his Honour found that they were ""a little late (understandably)"". The Crown did not oppose this finding and on the hearing of the appeal the Crown conceded that it could not assert otherwise in this Court. However, on the available material it appears that the finding by the Judge was erroneous as a matter of principle. I should point out that full argument was not heard on this issue because the Crown did not rely upon this matter as a ground of appeal and counsel for the respondent was obviously not given the opportunity to argue it. However, it is a good example of a common misconception about the discount for a plea of guilty. Although the principles are well established, they are often overlooked.
9  The applicant was arrested shortly after he committed each of the two sets of offences for which he was to be sentenced. In both cases he made full admissions to the police. Yet the applicant did not plead guilty in the Local Court but was committed for trial. He did not plead guilty until 24 May 2005, almost eight months after his arrest for the second offence.
10  Apparently the explanation for this delay was that the Crown was considering its attitude to the offence of escape. The Crown had originally found a bill for that offence and the indictment presented against the applicant contained a count for an offence of escape lawful custody. It seems that the applicant was not prepared to plead guilty to any offence charged against him until the Crown determined that the escape could be dealt with on a Form 1. There was a letter from a Crown Prosecutor placed in evidence before the Judge indicating what facts would be alleged to support the charge and that the count of escape would be removed from the indictment and placed on a Form 1. This letter was dated 20 May 2005. The respondent pleaded guilty to the remaining offences on the indictment four days later.
11  Frankly I do not understand how on the established principles it could be determined that the pleas of guilty for the offences for which the respondent was sentenced were early pleas and that they justified a discount of 25 per cent. There is no utility in a plea of guilty that has not been forthcoming. If the accused is not prepared to plead guilty until the Crown takes some course, then so be it. But if by withholding the plea the offender achieved the result he wanted, I do not understand why he should receive further favourable treatment on the basis that the plea of guilty had utilitarian value when it did not. Rarely, if ever, will the reason why the accused has withheld the plea of guilty be a relevant matter in determining the utilitarian discount. Where it has been used as a bargaining tool in order to achieve a favourable outcome from the Crown in respect of some other charge, I do not understand that this circumstance can excuse the delay or provides a basis for asserting that the plea was made at the first reasonable opportunity.
12  I accept that there may be exceptional cases, where as a matter of fairness to the offender, a discount will be given even though there was no utilitarian value in it. One such situation that has been recognised is where the Crown rejects the accused's plea of guilty to manslaughter and the accused is later acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter after trial: R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310; R v Cardoso [2003] NSWCCA 15. But in R v Harmouche [2005] NSWCCA 398 Hulme J, with whom Sully J and Latham J agreed, wrote:
[38]  Undoubtedly, the Respondent on the evidence before, and findings of, Judge Delaney made out an impressive subjective case. He had the factors of a plea, delay and youth arguing for a lesser penalty than would have been appropriate in their absence and was also entitled to have taken into account 134 days, i.e. something over 4 months, pre-sentence custody. 
[39]  That said, the 25% discount for the Respondent's plea was unduly generous. In giving it his Honour seems to have made a mistake commonly seen in this Court that because a plea was entered at the earliest opportunity (commonly shortly after the Crown reduces a charge) an offender is entitled to that discount. Such an approach is to misread R v Thompson and Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and to ignore the rationale for a discount of that degree. The Chief Justice made it clear, at [154-5], that the rationale for a 25% discount was the extent of the utilitarian benefit and the complexity of evidence gathering and of any trial which was avoided. Certainly his Honour made reference to a plea being entered at the earliest opportunity but that was in the context to which I have referred and where his Honour was obviously contemplating the committal stage of criminal proceedings where the community would be saved the costs associated with prosecution of the case from (the beginning of) that stage. 
[40]  That what I have said correctly reflects what the Chief Justice said derives support from observations of Hodgson JA, with whose remarks Barr J agreed, in R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 where, dealing with a complaint that only 16.7% had been allowed in the case of a plea entered in response to a lesser charge than originally preferred, his Honour said, at [5 - 6]:- ""If a plea is entered a long time after a person is first charged, but at a time when a lesser charge is substituted for a greater charge, the advantages to the administration of justice are less, even though the plea may have been made at the earliest opportunity. There is in any event no entitlement to a 25% discount; and the fact that in this situation there are less advantages to the administration of justice can justify a smaller discount.
This approach may mean that in some cases an offender may obtain a lower discount just because the prosecuting authorities initially brought a greater charge than that ultimately pursued, so that the delay in the plea of guilty was not the offender's fault. But this is consistent with the nature of the discount as being at least in part a recognition of practical advantages, and not merely a recognition of mitigation of culpability.""
[41]  I myself would go further. Albeit the extent of any discount is a matter in which a sentencing judge has some discretion - although as R v Thompson and Houlton at [159] makes clear, one subject to appellate review - where the rationale for a discount as high as 25% does not exist, a discount of that degree should not be given.
13  In the present case there was no attention paid by the Judge to the real utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty or to the established authority of R v Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117 and numerous other cases holding that there is no entitlement to any particular discount even if the plea of guilty is at the first reasonable opportunity. I cannot understand why the Crown's representative would concede that which was not true, a concession that is often made apparently as part of an agreement with the defence. Even approaching the matter on the rationale preferred by the majority in Cameron v The Queen (2002) 209 CLR 339, by treating the discount as reflecting a willingness to assist the administration of justice, there was no such willingness evident in this case until May 2005.""
33Similar observations were made by Howie J (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing) in R v Robert Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; 195 A Crim R 1.  His Honour there set out in point form the principles to be applied by sentencing courts in relation to the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty.  Those points were:
""32 ...
1. The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount: Thomson at [154]; Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [116].
2. Some allowance may be made in determining the discount where the trial would be particularly complicated or lengthy: Thomson at [154]. 
3. The utilitarian discount does not reflect any other consideration arising from the plea, such as saving witnesses from giving evidence but this is relevant to remorse: Thomson at [119] to [123]; nor is it affected by post-offending conduct: Perry [2006] NSWCCA 351.
4. The utilitarian discount does not take into account the strength of the prosecution case: Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225. 
5. There is to be no component in the discount for remorse nor is there to be a separate quantified discount for remorse: MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; Kite [2009] NSWCCA 12 or for the ""Ellis discount""; Lewins [2007] NSWCCA 189; S [2008] NSWCCA 186.
6. Where there are multiple offences and pleas at different times, the utilitarian value of the plea should be separately considered for each offence: SY [2003] NSWCCA 291 
7. There may be offences that are so serious that no discount should be given: Thomson at [158]; Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; where the protection of the public requires a longer sentence: El-Andouri [2004] NSWCCA 178. 
8. Generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Giac [2008] NSWCCA 280. 
9. The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain: Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; Ahmad [2006] NSWCCA 177; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown: Sullivan and Skillin [2009] NSWCCA 296; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Saad [2007] NSWCCA 98, such as having matters put on a Form 1: Chiekh and Hoete [2004] NSWCCA 448. 

10. An offer of a plea that is rejected by the Crown but is consistent with a jury verdict after trial can result in a discount even though there is no utilitarian value: Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310; Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129 
11. The discount can result in a different type of sentence but the resulting sentence should not again be reduced by reason of the discount: Lo [2003] NSWCCA 313. 
12. The amount of the discount does not depend upon the administrative arrangements or any practice in a particular court or by a particular judge for the management of trials or otherwise.""
34The observations in R v Robert Borkowski were endorsed by Bathurst CJ (with whom Hoeben J and Johnson J agreed) in R v AB [2011] NSWCCA 229 at [2] - [3].  In R v AB Johnson J (with whom Bathurst CJ and Hoeben J agreed) said:
""30 A person who pleads guilty to a criminal offence is, of course, entitled to dispute facts (beyond the elements of the offence) for the purpose of sentence. Where such a dispute occurs, any contested questions of fact adverse to an offender, must be established to the criminal standard of proof: O'Neil-Shaw v R [2010] NSWCCA 42. An offender is not to be penalised because he or she disputes certain facts on sentence and requires the Crown to prove those facts. 

31 The position is analogous to that of a person who goes to trial, who may not be penalised for the manner in which the defence at trial was conducted: Siganto v The Queen [1998] HCA 74; 194 CLR 656 at 666-667 [30]-[34]. However, as is made clear in Siganto v The Queen , a person who goes to trial is not entitled to mitigation for a plea of guilty. 
32 Likewise, a person who pleads guilty but puts the Crown to proof on certain factual issues and who loses that dispute, is not entitled to the same discount for a plea of guilty, on utilitarian grounds, as a person who does not require such a contested hearing.""
35Applying those principles to the facts of this case, the plea of guilty was simply not made at the earliest point in time.  Even had the offer by the applicant of 22 June 2011 been accepted, there would have been a contest as to the quantity of cocaine which formed the basis for the Form 1 matter.  That would occupy court time to decide and would have further eroded the utilitarian value of the plea.  In any event, the plea was only entered after the Crown had acceded to the applicant's proposal that the primary count be downgraded from supply to knowingly take part in supply.  In that respect, the circumstances are analogous to those in Stambolis.  
36Finally, the submissions by counsel for the applicant in the sentence proceedings accepted that a discount of 15 percent was within an appropriate range.  For the reasons set out in the cases quoted, that was a proper concession by counsel for the applicant.  He did not, as was submitted in this Court, err in doing so.  The applicant in this Court should be bound by the approach taken in the sentencing proceedings.  In that regard, the observations by Johnson J (McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreeing) in Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [80] - [82] apply, i.e., ""[the Court] ... will have an even greater reluctance to entertain arguments that seek to resile from concessions made below or a contradiction of submissions previously made"".
37It follows that this Ground of Appeal has not been made out.
Ground 2 - The sentencing judge erred in the application of the principles of parity of sentencing.
38Her Honour sentenced Mrowiec before she sentenced the applicant.  In sentencing Mrowiec, her Honour made the following findings:
""(a) He was 61 years of age at the time of sentencing and was a person of good character.
(b) He was at the ""bottom rung of the ladder"" and delivered the packages.  He was not aware of the quantity of drugs, their potential street value or the consequences if he was detected.
(c) In relation to his involvement in the offences, he was to receive $1,000 for the offence of 25 June 2011.
(d) He was allowed a discount of 25 percent for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty.
(e) His motivation for offending was to provide funds for his girlfriend who lived in Poland and needed money for her medical expenses being an altruistic purpose rather than greed.
(f) He was remorseful and contrite, was unlikely to re-offend and had excellent prospects of rehabilitation.
(g) His sentence would be more onerous due to his age and language problems.""  
A finding of special circumstances was made.  This appeared to be based on his age and language problems.  
39It was common ground that the starting point for the applicant's sentence before the 15 percent discount was 4 years and 8 months and that of Mrowiec, before his 25 percent discount, was 4 years.  Mrowiec pleaded guilty to the same offences as the applicant.  He was sentenced to a head sentence of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months.  Accordingly, the difference between the head sentences based on the starting points was 8 months and between the non-parole periods was 12 months.
40The applicant submitted that by reference to the similarities in the co-offender's subjective circumstances, and the part each played in the commission of the offences, such disparity was not justified.
41The applicant submitted that their subjective cases were similar but that he had significant medical conditions which would make imprisonment more serious for him.  The applicant submitted that there was very little difference between his role in the offences and that of Mrowiec and that her Honour had erred in her assessment of the importance of their roles.  
42The applicant submitted that both he and Mrowiec were facilitators and were essential links in the transactions.  Both of them had committed the offences for financial gain.  The applicant noted that her Honour's basis for the finding of special circumstances in each case was the same. 
Consideration
43The applicant's submissions should not be accepted.
44Her Honour was in the best position to assess the differences, both subjectively and objectively, in the positions of the applicant and Mrowiec, in that she had not only sentenced them but also their co-offenders, Bursach and Moskvin (Tatana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 at [28]; Loader v R; Dunn v R [2013] NSWCCA 215 at [91] - [95]).
45The difference between the applicant and Mrowiec in relation to the part they played in the offences was significant.  Based on that difference alone it might well be said that the sentences imposed by her Honour favoured the applicant rather than Mrowiec.
46The close relationship between Bursach and the applicant emerged clearly from the intercepted phone calls.  The applicant was aware of the quantity of drug involved, its price and the identity of the recipient.  His role as a facilitator can be seen to be significantly greater than that of Mrowiec in that he not only actively engaged in negotiations concerning delivery and price, but also in relation to the recovery of the monies agreed to be paid by the recipient.  This characterisation of the applicant's role as a facilitator was expressly accepted by counsel in the sentencing proceedings.
47This is to be contrasted with the position of Mrowiec who was purely a courier, played no part at all in negotiations and was not aware of the quantity of drugs involved.  The difference in remuneration is significant, i.e., $1,000 for Mrowiec and $2,000 for the applicant.  Finally, there was an altruistic element to which her Honour referred in Mrowiec's involvement in the offences, whereas that of the applicant was purely for financial gain.
48There is no basis for any justified sense of grievance on the part of the applicant.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
Ground 3 - The sentence was manifestly excessive.
49The applicant submitted that by reference to the function which he was carrying out, the correct characterisation of his conduct was that of an agent acting on behalf of the principal Bursach, rather than being directly involved in the supply.  He submitted that the business of supplying drugs was operated by Bursach and others, quite independently of him.  By reference to those matters and his more limited involvement, he submitted that his offending was towards the lower end of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.  He submitted that his remuneration of $2,000 was relatively small and therefore commensurate with the relatively small role which he played.
Consideration
50This submission should be rejected.  For the applicant to succeed on this ground, he has to establish that the sentence imposed was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" (Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]).  That is a difficult onus to discharge.  The matters to which the applicant has referred in submissions do not get close to achieving that result.
51Her Honour correctly assessed the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending.  The quantity of drugs involved was significant and their level of purity was comparatively high.  The part played by the applicant in the drug distribution process was important.  As her Honour appreciated, given the devastating effect of illicit drugs in the community, only a custodial sentence was appropriate for a person actively engaged in their supply.  Having regard to the maximum penalty for this offence, the sentence imposed was well open to her Honour.
52Statistics provide little assistance in this matter.  Those available are limited in number.  As has been said many times in this Court, statistics are a blunt indicator of sentencing trends and of necessity, fail to have regard to the particular circumstances of a case.  As was said in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 606 and cited with approval by the plurality (French CJ; Gummow, Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ) in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [55]:
""55 ...
[R]ecording what sentences have been imposed in other cases is useful if, but only if, it is accompanied by an articulation of what are to be seen as the unifying principles which those disparate sentences may reveal. The production of bare statistics about sentences that have been passed tells the judge who is about to pass sentence on an offender very little that is useful if the sentencing judge is not also told why those sentences were fixed as they were.""
53Her Honour carefully considered and identified all factors relevant to the sentence and discussed their significance.  No error has been identified in her exercise of discretion.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
54The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
55SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
56BARR AJ:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		20 February 2014",2014-02-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705512,Dia v Regina [2014] NSWCCA 9,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:AppealPursuant to s5(1)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against his conviction with respect to five offences of which he was found guilty by a jury.
2The applicant was called for trial on 9 October 2012 before Charteris DCJ and a jury of twelve at the District Court of NSW.  He was arraigned on an indictment charging six counts, all of which related to a ""home invasion"" carried out on 26 September 2011 at residential premises at Padstow.
3The jury retired to consider its verdicts on 15 October 2012 and returned the following day with verdicts of guilty to counts 1 - 5 inclusive.  Those counts were:
Enter dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence (robbery) in circumstances of aggravation (in company), contrary to s111(2) Crimes Act 1900.
Robbery whilst armed (of McCann) contrary to s97(1) Crimes Act 1900.Reckless wounding in company contrary to s35(3) Crimes Act 1900.Robbery whilst armed (of Dunston) contrary to s97(1) Crimes Act 1900.Robbery whilst armed (of Sheen) contrary to s97(1) Crimes Act 1900.
4A verdict of not guilty by direction of the trial judge was returned in relation to a sixth count which alleged a common assault upon a person whose attendance at trial as a witness was unable to be secured.
5On 3 April 2013 the applicant was sentenced to an aggregate penalty of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 3 months, commencing 29 September 2012 and expiring 28 December 2015, with a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months expiring 28 March 2019.  No application for leave to appeal against sentence has been made.
6The grounds upon which the applicant relies for his appeal against conviction are:
Ground 1 - The trial miscarried as a result of the learned trial judge failing to discharge the jury.Ground 2 - The verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
Crown case at trial
7The Crown presented a joint indictment charging the applicant and a co-accused, Mohammad Fawaz, with the six offences.  Both matters were heard together.  The Crown case was that the applicant and co-accused were two of a group of young men who broke into a house at Padstow at 7 o'clock on the evening of Monday 26 September 2011, terrorised the occupants and robbed them of property.
8At the time of the offences, Jade McCann with her partner Robert Sheen and his brother Kevin Dunston, lived in the house and were at home.  They were joined by Aaron Thornton, the brother of Jade McCann.  Two other friends, Jake Wilson and John Tsakrios, came to the house as well.  Robert Sheen and Jake Wilson left the house before the offences occurred.
9At about 7pm there was a knock at the door.  Mr Tsakrios answered the door.  The co-accused, Mohammad Fawaz, walked into the premises and pushed past Mr Tsakrios.  About six or seven other males of Middle Eastern appearance entered behind the co-accused.  It was the Crown case that the applicant was one of these males.
10Jade McCann recognised the first person who came in as the co-accused Fawaz.  Fawaz had attended the same school as Mr Dunston and Mr Sheen and she had seen Fawaz with her group of friends.  Fawaz had previously been to her house.  Mr Thornton also recognised the first male, although he did not remember his name.  
11Jade McCann described what followed as:
""From then it was pretty much a blur, it happened so fast.  Knives were pulled out as I said, a lot of yelling and screaming for us to give pot and money.  Another gentleman went to grab my brother-in-law and Kevin and took him into his room.  I'm not sure what happened there, I just remember having one gentleman over the top of my brother and I just screaming at us with a knife at us.  I just, all I can remember is trying to pull my brother as close away as I could.  He was very scared and they just kept yelling at us that they were going to stab us if we couldn't give them anything.""  (T.9.10.12 at p26.43)
12A number of the assailants had knives including the applicant.  They punched Mr Dunston and took him into the bedroom.  They were yelling ""Give me your stuff, give me your weed"".  Mr Dunston's nose was broken.  During the incident there was lots of pushing and shoving and yelling.  Mr Thornton was stabbed in the leg although at the time he could not see who stabbed him.  
13Lynette Sheen (Robert Sheen's mother), who lived at the back in a converted granny flat, came into the house to see what was going on because she could hear yelling and shouting.  She saw several males with knives.  As soon as she saw this Mrs Sheen ran out the door and down the driveway to the granny flat.  She picked up her phone to dial triple 0.  As she did two of the men came into her flat, both carrying knives.  They pointed their knives at her.  One of them told her to give him the phone and she threw the phone at him.  He took her phone and then both males ran out pointing their knives back at her.
14The offenders searched through the main house.  Ultimately they took a Navman and an iPhone 4 from Ms McCann.  They also took an iPhone 3 from Mr Dunston.  After the males left, Ms McCann called triple 0 and they all waited until the police arrived.  Mr Thornton was taken to Bankstown Hospital where he had three stitches inserted into his left leg.
15Police interviewed Ms McCann on 26 September 2011.  After the statement was completed, Detective Horvat asked Ms McCann if she was a member of Facebook and after receiving a positive response, the detective and Ms McCann did a Facebook search of the site of the co-accused Fawaz, using the detective's mobile phone.  One of the images that was observed on the co-accused's Facebook site was a group of Middle Eastern people outside the Bankstown Railway Station.  That image was downloaded and became Exhibit A.  
16Ms McCann saw that picture some 30 to 45 minutes after the incident.  When the picture was printed out, Ms McCann identified Mr Fawaz on it, signing and dating the photograph.  The following day Ms McCann went onto the Facebook site of the co-accused Fawaz and went through his photos to see if she could identify any of the other faces from the night of the incident.
17When scrolling across the Facebook site, a profile came up of Ali Khawaja.  Ms McCann then went to Ali Khawaja's Facebook page.  Ms McCann only had limited access because she was not a 'friend' of Ali Khawaja.  She saw a photograph of three men and immediately recognised the person who had stabbed her brother.  The photograph was printed out and tendered.  This became Exhibit B.  Ali Khawaja was the Facebook name of the applicant.  The person Ms McCann recognised as having stabbed her brother was the applicant.
18In cross-examination Ms McCann gave a description of the person who stabbed her brother, including that he was about 5 foot tall (although she was not good with heights) and had hair that was about a millimetre long.  None of the other people in the house could recognise any assailant.  
19On 26 September 2011 Robert Sheen went to the Bankstown Police Station because the police wanted to take a statement from him.  While there he saw and spoke to the co-accused Fawaz.  Fawaz told Robert Sheen that he had gone to the house and walked in and the rest of the people who were there pulled knives out.  Mr Sheen pressed Mr Fawaz for the return of the items stolen.  Mr Fawaz made a telephone call and then said to Mr Sheen that the boys could only get the iPhone 4 back.  He told Mr Sheen that when he got the iPhone 4 back, he would give Mr Sheen a call.  The next day the police arrested Mr Fawaz and they found in his house the iPhone 4 belonging to Ms McCann.
20Mr Fawaz participated in an electronically recorded interview.  He said that he went to the house by himself to see Robert Sheen.  He said he knocked on the door and all of a sudden four or five people came out of cars and as the door was opened and he walked in, those persons immediately followed him inside pulling out knives.  He said that he did not know these persons and had not seen them before.  He said he was scared and feared for his life.  He went into one of the bedrooms to try to find a knife to defend himself but ultimately opened a window, jumped and ""legged it"" home.  He told police that he had spoken to a person that he recognised from a description given to him by Kevin Dunston and arranged for the return of the iPhone 4.
The applicant's defence case
21The applicant gave evidence that he knew Mr Fawaz before the night of the incident but he did not know him well.  He had met him at a festival at Bankstown.  He had met him where there was a large group of boys hanging out.  There was a large group being photographed and he decided to jump in the photo.  He just introduced himself to Fawaz through another mate.
22The applicant said that the next time he had any further contact with Mr Fawaz was at court the week before the trial.  He agreed that he had a Facebook site in the name of Ali Khawaja.  He said that when you went onto his Facebook page about 14 or so photos of him came up.
23The photograph of the large number of people of Middle Eastern origin standing outside Bankstown Station was not taken at the Bankstown Station.  It was taken at Paul Keating Park.  Someone had edited the photo and made it look like it was at the Bankstown Railway Station.  He recognised most of the people in the photo, including Mr Fawaz.  The applicant was the person in the front row, the third person from the left.  That photo was not on his Facebook site.  The 14 photos on his Facebook site could be seen in the public domain.  You did not need to be his Facebook 'friend'.
24The applicant was 5 foot 6 in height.  When the police arrested him, he received legal advice from his solicitor that he did not have to do a record of interview.  He provided his DNA voluntarily to the police.  He also offered to take part in an identification line-up.
25He denied that he went to the house on 26 September and terrorised the people in the house.  He was not able to remember where he was on that night.
Ground 1 - The trial miscarried as a result of the learned trial judge failing to discharge the jury.
26In order to understand the Ground of Appeal and submissions, it is necessary to provide further information by way of background.
27Although Mr Fawaz did not give evidence at trial, he had provided a record of interview to the police.  That record of interview was videoed and the video was played to the jury.  While the video was being shown, the jury had before it as an aide memoire a transcript of the contents of the interview.  That transcript was removed when the showing of the video was completed.
28The following parts of that record of interview are relevant to this Ground of Appeal.  These questions and answers were directed to Fawaz explaining how he came to have the iPhone 4 in his possession.
""Q.424 Did you have possession of any of that property that I have mentioned tonight?A.  Yeah iPhone.
Q.425 All right.  How did you get the iPhone?A.  Um I later met up with one of the people that was there.
Q.426 Um and where does this happen?A.  The bloke one, one of them five four people five whatever.
Q.427 Um --A.  I ended up knowing who he is one of, one of them.
Q.428 All right.  Can you tell me how this happened?A.  Robert was um telling me ah, 'cause Robert was telling me when um, when he was inside actually, it was Kevin that was telling me, Kevin was telling me that um when someone got injured or something the guy showed, revealed his face and said ""remember me"" or something like that, that's what Kevin told me.
Q.429 And when did Kevin tell you this?A.  When I was at the cop shop outside.
Q.430 All right.A.  Yep.
Q.431 And what did Kevin say?A.  He goes that um when this bloke, injured my mate, Aaron.
Q.432 Um A. ... He goes um the bloke took off his hat and hood and said ""remember me, remember my face"" or something like that.
Q.433 All right.A.  And then that's the bloke that I ended up finding out who he was.
Q.434 How, how did you find out who he was?A.  From Kevin, like, he described him for me.
Q.435 All right.  So ...A.  His tatt and that.
Q.436 All right.  What did Kevin say about his tattoo?A.  That it was a sword, he has a sword here (indicating lower right arm).
Q.437 Um --A.  Yeah that's it.
Q.438 And what did you say to Kevin?A.  I'm like oh, but like, I was shocked to find out that it was him.
Q.439 All right.  And who was it?A.  It was my mate.
Q.440 What's his name?A.  I can't, can't do it man.
Q.441 But you do know who it was but you ...A.  I do know who it was after it.""
29It was common ground that the evidence of the record of interview given by Fawaz was admissible only against Fawaz.
30After the record of interview of Fawaz was played to the jury, the following evidence was given by Detective Horvat:
""Q.  You've given evidence about Ms McCann providing you with some information which led you to do some research on Facebook regarding a Mr Khawaja?A.  Yeah.
Q.  You viewed various photographs on his website?A.  Yes.
Q.  You also ascertained that was his Facebook name?A.  Yes.
Q.  But his other name is Mr Dia?A.  Yes.
Q.  When you were viewing these photographs did you notice whether he had any body markings that you could see on the photographs?A.  Yes.  One of the photographs he is wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt and he had a tattoo on the inside of his right forearm.
Q.  On the inside of his left forearm?A.  Right forearm.
Q.  What was the tattoo of?A.  A sword.
COUNSEL FOR APPLICANT:  I object to this.  I need to be heard in the absence of the jury."" (T.10.10.13, p101.12)
31A discussion then took place between counsel for the applicant and his Honour.  It was common ground that Detective Horvat's answer ""a sword"" was barely audible.  His Honour did not hear it clearly, nor did others at the bar table.  The tape had to be played back twice before his Honour was satisfied as to exactly what was said.  Despite that difficulty, this appeal proceeded on the basis that at least one of the jury might have heard the answer and if so, that was sufficient for the matter to be properly raised.
32It was during this discussion between counsel for the applicant and his Honour that counsel for the applicant asked for the jury to be discharged.  His Honour refused that application.  The following exchange took place between counsel for the applicant and his Honour:
""HIS HONOUR:  It was really the answer of the sword that causes you concern. 
COUNSEL:  Yes, that's the poison, yes.
HIS HONOUR:  Well for these reasons I reject the application for a termination of this trial and the reasons are as follows.  The evidence is admissible as to the answer given by the accused in his record of interview.  He had said that there was a person who had a tattoo said to be of a sword on the right arm.   The accused, Mr Khawaja,(as said) knew this person and that tattoo had been described to him by one of the victims, Mr Sheen, that had caused him to contact his friend, or ""his mate"" as he described him, which eventually led to Mr Khawaja recovering from a park in Bankstown the stolen iPhone.  In my view the evidence is admissible in the case against Mr Khawaja and there is --
COUNSEL:  Mr Fawaz.
HIS HONOUR:  I beg your pardon?
COUNSEL:  Mr Fawaz.
HIS HONOUR:  Fawaz, I'm sorry, did I say Khawaja?  Mr Fawaz.  There was no objection taken to the evidence by [counsel for Fawaz] at the time.  [Counsel] for the Accused Dia objected to the evidence, the answer ""a sword"".  Initially I had not heard the word ""sword"" but it has been replayed twice and the witness had uttered the word ""sword"" as [counsel for the applicant] was objecting and by concentrating on the replay of the tape the word ""sword"" was mentioned.  [Counsel for the applicant] now seeks that I discharge the jury.  He suggests it will adversely affect his client's case on identification.  I do not agree with that submission.  The evidence I will confine to be only admissible in the case against Mr Fawaz.  Secondly, to state the obvious, there are many persons who have tattoos in the community, many of different objects on different areas of their bodies.  I do not consider that the admission of this evidence would adversely affect the evidence in respect of the accused Mr Dia.
...
COUNSEL:  Is it the case that your Honour is going to allow the evidence of the sword?
HIS HONOUR:  Well there is no objection yet by [counsel for Fawaz].  What's your position?  You haven't objected to the evidence at all.
COUNSEL FOR FAWAZ:  No, there is no basis for me to object I don't see your Honour.
HIS HONOUR:  Yes very well, yes I will allow it.  I don't know whether the - I don't think this issue would be magnified in submissions anyway but the evidence is - I think I raised the issue about a witness, giving rather than the best evidence giving evidence that I saw upon a forearm what seemed to me to be a sword.  There is no other better evidence.  It's not objected to by the accused against whom it's led.  I intend to allow it but I don't see and it's my judgment I can't see that adversely affects your client's case."" (T.10.10.13, p106.43-108.4)
33In the presence of the jury, the trial judge then gave the following direction:
""HIS HONOUR:  Members of the jury, just before I sent you out there was evidence from the witness that she had accessed the Facebook site of Mr Khawaja.  As I understand it there's no issue in this case that that's the Facebook site of Mr Dia.  The witness said that she observed a photograph.  In her opinion there was a tattoo on the right forearm. 
The evidence about tattoo in relation to Mr Dia is not led against Mr Dia by the prosecution, it's only led in the case against Mr Fawaz because Mr Fawaz made some comments about a person having a tattoo.  So when you come to consider your verdict you will just take that evidence in determining the issues before you as regards the accused Mr Fawaz and not in relation to Mr Dia.
In the same way that Mr Fawaz's recorded interview is only admissible against him the evidence that was led from the witness about a tattoo, as she thought it was, is only admissible in the case against Mr Fawaz.  I hope you understand that.  Yes thank you."" (T.10.10.12, p109.1)
34It was common ground in the appeal that thereafter no mention was made  by any witness, counsel or his Honour of any tattoo and in particular of the applicant having a tattoo anywhere on his body.  In fact the only time there was a reference to the record of interview of Mr Fawaz was by his Honour in his summing up where his Honour said:
""The record of interview that Mr Fawaz engaged in - the interview that you saw played back to you - is only tendered against Mr Fawaz.  You cannot use anything that is said in that record of interview in deciding the case against Mr Dia.  It is exclusively led before you in the case against Mr Fawaz and it is important that you understand that you can only utilise it in his case.  When you come to consider the case of Mr Dia you ignore the recorded interview of Mr Fawaz.  Similarly a conversation was led from a witness Robert Sheen; you might recall he gave evidence about having a conversation with Mr Fawaz in the vicinity of the Bankstown police station.  It will be a matter for you to determine what were the terms of that conversation but what Mr Fawaz said to Mr Sheen, if anything of importance, is only admissible in the case against Mr Fawaz.  It is not admissible in the case against Mr Dia.""  (SU 11.1)
35The applicant submitted that the admission of the evidence by Detective Horvat about the applicant having a tattoo on his right forearm was highly damaging to his defence that Ms McCann had wrongly identified him.  This was because when taken with the ERISP of Mr Fawaz, the overwhelming inference was that the person that Mr Fawaz said was identified by Kevin Dunston as having been present at the time of the offence and who had a tattoo of a sword on his lower right forearm, was Mr Dia.  The applicant submitted that unless the evidence of Detective Horvat as to the tattoo was intended to have that effect, it was not relevant and therefore not admissible.
36The applicant submitted that on the assumption that this particular evidence of Mr Fawaz in his record of interview was accepted by the jury, the evidence of the sword tattoo by Detective Horvat was the only evidence which might corroborate the identification evidence of Ms McCann.  Without that evidence the entirety of the Crown's case against the applicant depended upon the jury accepting Ms McCann and on nothing else.
37In making that submission the applicant accepted that when Kevin Dunston gave evidence in the proceedings he did not say anything about seeing any person with a tattoo and denied having any conversation with Mr Fawaz in or outside the police station (T.10.10.13, p171).
38The applicant accepted that in cases where the possible discharge of the jury is an issue, the opinion and appreciation of the trial judge of the atmosphere of the trial is given appropriate weight by an appellate court.  He submitted that in this case the trial judge's opinion should not be given such weight because it was apparent from his Honour's reasons for rejecting the discharge application, that his Honour did not appreciate, or at least fully appreciate, the potential prejudicial effect on the applicant's case of the evidence as to the sword tattoo being heard by the jury.  
39The applicant invited the Court to draw that inference because of the focus by his Honour on the admissibility of the evidence, as distinct from its prejudicial effect.
40The applicant submitted that this was one of those situations where it was not possible for his Honour to fashion a direction to the jury which would effectively eradicate from their minds this highly prejudicial evidence.  In that regard, the applicant relied upon the observations of the majority of the High Court in Crofts v R [1996] HCA 22; 186 CLR 427 at 441-442.
41The applicant summarised his submissions as follows:
""50 In the context of the appellant's case the evidence led against the co-accused that was inadmissible against the appellant contained material and a reasoning process that was highly prejudicial to the appellant.  The evidence was led reasonably early in the Crown case.  Ms McCann had given evidence and Constable Horvat was the second witness and still in evidence in chief. ...
51 In the context of the issues in the appellant's case, the Crown case against the appellant was made ""immeasurably stronger"" as a result of that prejudicial material.  The failure to discharge the jury led to a miscarriage of justice.""
Consideration
42As the applicant appreciated, the leading case in this area is Crofts.  That case concerned allegations of sexual assault on a child by a family friend.  In pre-trial rulings, the trial judge directed that no mention be made of other uncharged sexual assaults on the victim by the same offender.  The offender was convicted of five counts but acquitted of eight others.  During the course of the trial, evidence was led by the Prosecution of other uncharged sexual offences as follows:
""Q.  Did that happen again?It happened many times but I never had the opportunity to do anything about it.""
It was in the context of a refusal to discharge the jury in those circumstances that the matter came before the High Court.  
43The majority (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) made the following observations at p 440-442:
""Obviously, the appellant was in a difficult position so far as the warning was concerned. Any specific reference to the evidence, and repetition of it, would simply underline its importance and reinforce the possible prejudice. But any generalised statement, such as the judge suggested, would run the risk of missing the target of prejudice which it was the object of the direction to cure.
...

No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript.
Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable? ...
There are two other considerations which do not appear to have been taken into account, or adequately taken into account, in the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision on this point. The first is that it was specially difficult in this case for the judge to fashion a direction to the jury which would help them to eradicate from their minds the highly prejudicial statement of the complainant. It is always difficult to expunge prejudice from the mind, especially where it is expressed vividly in terms of facts.  But in the imperfect environment of the trial process, it is necessary to operate upon the assumption that a jury will be capable of conforming to judicial instruction to put particular evidence out of account.  The difficulty in this case was that the judge could not, and did not, refer specifically to the evidence which was so prejudicial because to do so would have reinforced the prejudice.  In some cases it is possible for the judge to refer to the inadmissible evidence and to explain why it must be excluded.  That course was not open in this case and for that reason was not followed.
...
With all respect to the trial judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal, a proper consideration of the factors relevant to weighing the prejudice to the accused, the danger to the fairness of the trial and the risk that such danger could not be eradicated by instruction to the jury necessitated, in this case, an order of discharge. Otherwise, the Court would sanction a real risk that the appellant might have been convicted on the basis of the prejudicial evidence about sexual misconduct ""many times"". This was not charged in the counts of the presentment. It was of a different character to the counts on which the appellant was acquitted. And it was produced by questioning which appears to have been deliberate and fraught with the danger of producing the result that predicably ensued.""
44It should be noted that it was not suggested in these proceedings that the impugned evidence from Detective Horvat was deliberately led with the intention of placing inadmissible evidence before the jury.  The approach followed by both sides was that this evidence should be treated on the basis that it ""inadvertently"" came before the jury.
45While it is true that his Honour's reasons did not focus on the prejudicial effect of the evidence on the applicant's case, his advantageous position as trial judge still needs to be given due weight.  Mr Fawaz did not give evidence.  The videoed statement was the only evidence of his version of events.  It comprised 518 questions and answers which were set out on 46 pages of transcript.  Except for the evidence of the tattoo, the balance of the evidence, as his Honour appreciated, was clearly relevant to the case against Mr Fawaz in that it showed him being in contact with at least one person involved in the offences whom he characterised as a ""mate"", having told police that he did not know any of the offenders who followed him into the house and that he had 'never seen them in my life'.  Having seen the record of interview and the evidence from Detective Horvat, his Honour was in the best position to assess the likelihood of those pieces of evidence being linked together so as to prejudice the applicant.  This is so when the particular evidence in the record of interview was somewhat obscure and formed but a small part of a much larger body of evidence.
46While I agree that due to the reasons given by his Honour for not discharging the jury, his advantageous position is not a decisive consideration, it cannot be entirely disregarded.  In that regard, the observation of McClellan CJ at CL in Khazaal v R [2011] NSWCCA 129 (with whom McCallum J agreed) is pertinent:
""49 ... If the assumption of the common law that jurors understand and follow the judge's instruction is to be more than hollow rhetoric it is important that appellate courts pay appropriate respect to the discretion of the trial judge who is in a far superior position to the appellate court to appreciate the atmosphere of the trial and determine whether appropriate instruction will ensure that the trial is fair.""
47There is an important distinction between this matter and the circumstances considered in Crofts because in this case the trial judge was able to be more specific in directing the jury to ignore the evidence about which complaint was made.  His Honour was able to give a specific direction directed to the tattoo.  Following the resumption of the trial, his Honour said:
""The evidence about a tattoo in relation to Mr Dia is not led against Mr Dia by the prosecution it is only led in the case against Mr Fawaz because Fawaz made some comments about a person having a tattoo.  So when you come to consider your verdict, you will just take that evidence in determining the issues before you as regards the accused Mr Fawaz and not in relation to Mr Dia.""
That direction was specific and clear and did not in the circumstances, contrary to the applicant's submission on appeal, reinforce the impermissible chain of reasoning in relation to the appellant's identity, which the jury was not to engage in by reference to the evidence of the tattoo.
48The function of this Court is not only to assess his Honour's exercise of discretion in accordance with House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 principles but it must also decide for itself whether the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  Insofar as House v The King is concerned, I am not persuaded that his Honour acted upon a wrong principle or took into account some extraneous consideration or failed to take into account a relevant consideration or mistook the facts.
49Nor am I satisfied that the circumstances of this case occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  Apart from his Honour's specific direction upon resumption of the trial, no mention was thereafter made of a tattoo in the trial.  As already indicated, the link between the record of interview of Mr Fawaz and the impugned evidence while present, was not particularly clear.  The direction by his Honour to the jury that they could not take the tattoo into account in the case against Mr Dia was clear and explicit.  Moreover, on five occasions his Honour in the clearest of terms directed the jury that when considering the Crown case against Mr Dia it was not to take into account what Mr Fawaz told the police (T10.10.13, p92.14, T10.10.13, p109.9, SU 8.6, SU 9.1, SU 28.2).  There was nothing to suggest that the jury did not give full force and effect to these strong directions given by his Honour.
50The assumption that jurors understand and comply with directions of the trial judge has been emphasised on numerous occasions by this and other superior courts (R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; 173 CLR 592 at 603).  In accordance with his Honour's directions, the only evidence relevant to the relationship between the applicant and Mr Fawaz which was left to the jury when it considered its verdicts was that of the applicant that he had been introduced to Mr Fawaz on only one occasion and had simply jumped into a group of men who were being photographed.  His evidence was that he and Mr Fawaz were most definitely not ""mates"". 
51It follows that I am satisfied from my own perusal of the evidence that the refusal to discharge the jury did not occasion a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice.  Ground of Appeal 1 has not been made out.
Ground 2 - The verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence.
52The applicant submitted that the identification evidence led by the Crown was so flawed as to be incapable of sustaining the verdicts returned by the jury.  This Court was invited to assess the identification evidence in accordance with the test in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 48 at 493:
""...the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.""
53In support of this ground, the applicant identified what he described as a number of ""significant defects in the identification evidence of Ms McCann"".  For the purposes of this Ground of Appeal, the applicant accepted as did the Crown at trial, that the Crown's case against him depended entirely upon an acceptance by the jury of the identification evidence of Ms McCann.  He submitted that if that evidence was unreliable, the Crown case against him must fail.
54The particular ""defects"" relied upon by the applicant were that Ms McCann had been smoking marijuana before the offences occurred and that the marijuana ""got me stoned"".  It followed that her observations were made whilst she was under the influence of marijuana.  The applicant also relied upon the fact that her observations were made in traumatic circumstances.
55Another ""defect"" upon which the applicant relied was the circumstances in which Ms McCann came to identify him.  He drew the Court's attention to the following matters.  Ms McCann had failed to identify him on the night of the offences, despite the fact that Exhibit A made it clear that she had seen his photograph that night.  On the following day, she was scrolling through the Facebook entries of Mr Fawaz with the specific intent ""to see if I could identify any of the other faces from the night"".  In other words, she had an expectation that one or more of the friends of Mr Fawaz, whose images appeared on his Facebook, would be among the persons who committed the offences.  The applicant also submitted that there was the potential for a displacement effect in that Ms McCann had already seen a photograph of him on the night of the offences (i.e. Exhibit A).
56The applicant relied upon what he said were two obvious errors in Ms McCann's description of him.  He was 5 foot 6 inches in height not 5 foot and a photograph of him taken 15 days after the offences showed hair significantly longer than the description of 1 millimetre given by Ms McCann.
57The applicant submitted that since that was the totality of the identification evidence against him, it could not be said that the jury had any advantage over this Court in assessing its probative value.  The applicant submitted that evidence of such poor quality would of necessity leave this Court with a reasonable doubt, being a doubt which the jury should also have had.  The applicant submitted that the issue was not whether Ms McCann was an honest witness, but whether she was a reliable witness.
Consideration
58Ground of Appeal 2 should be rejected on a number of bases.
59While the demeanour of a witness is not decisive, the jury were in a far better position to assess the evidence of Ms McCann than is this Court.  This is particularly so since all of the matters raised by the applicant as ""defects"" in her evidence were vigorously put to her in cross-examination and dealt with by her.  The jury had the opportunity which this Court does not, of assessing the responses of Ms McCann whilst under pressure in a stressful adversarial context.
60Moreover, the potential dangers associated with identification evidence generally and of the evidence of Ms McCann in particular, were clearly explained to the jury by the trial judge on a number of occasions in his summing up (SU 14.6, 15.4, 18.2, 21.1, 21.8, 22.6, 23.4, 23.8).  Each of the purported ""defects"" identified by the applicant was raised at the trial, both in cross-examination and in submissions to the jury.  They were all matters that the jury was readily capable of assessing.
61Despite the advantages of the jury, it is still necessary for this Court to examine the evidence for itself and form its own opinion as to the adequacy of the evidence (SKA v R [2011] HCA 13; 243 CLR 400 at 405-406 [11] and [13]).
62Ms McCann acknowledged in chief and in cross-examination that she had consumed marijuana.  While she did not advise the investigating police officer of that fact, she did tell the triple 0 operator.  Although Ms McCann acknowledged being ""stoned"" as a result of her consumption of marijuana, what she meant by that expression was not explored.
63There was, however, other evidence which indicated that although Ms McCann might have been affected by her consumption of marijuana, that affectation did not adversely affect her powers of observation.  The record of her communication with the triple 0 operator did not indicate any inability on her part to convey information clearly and concisely.  Similarly, when she was interviewed by the investigating police officers on the night of the offences, neither officer assessed that she was under the influence of any substance or was otherwise unable to provide a clear statement as to what had occurred.  To the contrary Detective Horvat's evidence was that Ms McCann did not appear to be affected by any substance.  The jury not only had the opportunity of observing Ms McCann give her evidence, but they also were able to listen to 12 minutes of her conversation with the triple 0 operator.
64In tandem with the issue of intoxication, the applicant suggested that the traumatic circumstances of the offences would also have had an adverse impact on her ability to make accurate observations.  While it is open to the applicant to raise that issue, there was no evidence that Ms McCann was so affected.  There was no suggestion by the investigating police officers that she was unable to clearly convey information to them.  All that can be said is that while trauma and distress may adversely affect the powers of observation of some people, there is no evidence that it had that effect on Ms McCann.  
65There is little substance in the criticism of Ms McCann's description of the applicant.  When giving evidence as to his height, she protested on a number of occasions that she was not ""good with her centimetres"" or with inches, or indeed with ""maths"".  Her estimate of the applicant's height at 5 foot was significantly qualified.  What Ms McCann did observe was that the applicant was short in stature.  In that respect, the observation was accurate.  The submission as to the length of his hair goes nowhere because there was no evidence as to the rate of growth of his hair.  Clearly the jury saw no incongruity in the proposition that in fifteen days the applicant's hair progressed from a short crew cut length to a close cropped style, as shown in Exhibit 1.
66The criticism of the circumstances in which Ms McCann made her identification of the applicant while available to be raised, is not decisive.  The images viewed by Ms McCann on the night of the offences came from the Detective's phone.  They were downloaded from that phone.  In her evidence, the Detective described them as ""grainy"" and said that she would have had difficulty in identifying the applicant from such images (T.10.10.13, p124.12).  Moreover, Ms McCann was not looking at those images with the intent of identifying other persons involved in the offences but to confirm her identification of Mr Fawaz.  
67It is clear that on the day following the offences, Ms McCann's intent when examining the various Facebook sites was different.  She freely accepted that she did so in order to ""identify"" if she could, any of the other persons who had participated in the offences on the night. When doing so she was able to identify the applicant.  There are obvious dangers associated with any identification from a photograph and there were some particular dangers associated with this mode of identification.  These matters were not only put to Ms McCann in cross-examination but clear warnings as to the reliability of the identification were given by his Honour to the jury.
68While there are dangers in such a process of identification, it is also a method which is acceptable and evidence concerning such identification is admissible.  The process of identification undertaken by Ms McCann was analogous with her attending a police station and examining a photographic array or going to a police station to view a line-up.
69Finally, the risk that the so called ""displacement effect"" might have influenced Ms McCann's identification of the applicant on this occasion is significantly reduced when regard is had to the fact that on the night of the offences, the intention of Ms McCann in viewing the Facebook images was to confirm the identification of Mr Fawaz, not to identify other offenders.
70It follows from my examination of the evidence that upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the identification of the applicant by Ms McCann as one of the offenders and therefore that he was guilty.  This ground of appeal has not been made out.
71The order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted, but that the appeal be dismissed.
72SCHMIDT J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
73BARR AJ:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

		20 February 2014",2014-02-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705514,R v Jagurdzia [2014] NSWCCA 3,"Judgment OF THE COURT

1On 12 September 2013, Craigie DCJ sentenced Elmir Jagurzdia to 2 years, 5 months and 21 days imprisonment, fixing a non-parole period of 1 year, 7 months and 9 days, for an offence of robbery in company committed on 22 January 2012, with a balance of term of 10 months and 12 days, commencing on 12 September 2013, the day of sentencing. 

2The offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The respondent entered a plea on the day after the expected trial date, with the result that a discount of 10% was allowed by the sentencing judge for his plea. His Honour found that the respondent's offence, which involved the theft of a skateboard from his 13 year old victim, fell into the low range. This was not in issue between the parties on appeal.

3The sentence imposed was fixed to commence on 3 February 2012, his Honour observing that he intended that the respondent be released to parole immediately. Shortly after the sentence was imposed the Crown drew to his Honour's attention that he had sentenced on the basis of inaccurate information as to the period during which the respondent had been held in custody prior to sentencing. The respondent had not spent 1 year, 7 months in custody, as his Honour had understood, but only in total some 207 days, of which only some 28 days were referable to this offence.

4It was common ground that his Honour had the discretion to reconsider the sentence. Having heard the parties his Honour said that he was minded to proceed on the basis that the respondent had been held in custody for this and other matters, for which he had not been and may never be convicted, and invited further submissions. The Crown submitted that the starting date for the sentence should be adjusted to reflect the shorter time that the respondent had spent in custody prior to sentencing. His Honour then vacated the earlier orders he had made and adjourned. On resumption his Honour announced that he considered that the respondent had 'served the time he should' and that the adjustment sought by the Crown would not see the respondent released until April 2014, which he regarded as quite excessive, given the nature of the offence. 

5The orders his Honour had initially made were reinstated, with the result that the respondent was released to parole, having served only some 207 days in custody, most of which was referable to another offence, not the 1 year, 7 months and 9 days which his Honour had earlier understood the respondent had spent in custody referable to the subject offence which was encompassed in the non-parole period he had imposed. 

6The respondent nevertheless remained in custody, because he was then bail refused in relation to an offence of wound with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. The trial on that charge commenced on 30 September 2013. It was adjourned and the next day the respondent pleaded guilty to an offence of reckless wounding in company. He remains in custody and is due to be sentenced for that offence by Tupman DCJ in the District Court on 10 February 2014.

7On 20 September 2013, the Crown brought an appeal under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) on the ground that the sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate. By consent a second ground was added at the hearing that the sentence imposed was contrary to law. 

8On 20 December, the respondent sought leave to appeal the sentence on three grounds. Firstly, that the miscalculation of the time he had spent in custody had led the sentencing judge to impose a longer period of imprisonment than he had intended. Secondly, that his Honour had erred in failing to give proper or adequate consideration to whether the appropriate sentence was a non custodial sentence, as s 5(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) required. Thirdly, that the sentence had given rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, given the sentence which had been imposed on his co-offender.

9It was common ground at the hearing that the sentencing judge had fallen into error, that the Crown appeal should be upheld and the matter remitted to the District Court for re-sentence, where it could be dealt with by Tupman DCJ, who is to sentence the respondent for the outstanding wounding charge on 10 February 2014. Sentencing for that offence will require the resolution of questions of totality arising from this offence. 

10It was in those circumstances and on that basis that the respondent withdrew his application for leave to appeal, the Crown accepting that thereby he did not abandon his case that the sentencing judge had erred, with the result that too heavy a sentence had been imposed upon him for this offence. That is the case which he will press in the District Court on re-sentence. 

11Ordinarily, if a sentence is quashed by this Court on appeal, it must pass another sentence in substitution on the offender (see s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act). Power to remit the matter to the District Court for re-sentencing, after a sentence is quashed by this Court is, however, granted by s 12(2) of that Act (see Regina v Pamplin [2001] NSWCCA 327 and O'Neil-Shaw v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 42). 

12The parties' common view as to the errors into which his Honour fell, so that the Crown appeal must be upheld and that in the circumstances which have arisen, the re-sentence should be undertaken in the District Court must be accepted. 

13The approach which his Honour adopted failed to adhere to settled principle. The Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the authorities which bind sentencing judges do not permit a sentence to be structured so as to ensure that an offender is released from custody on the date of sentencing, without the offender having first served in custody the minimum period which it is determined justice requires be served for that offence. 

14Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires that a non-parole period be set and that the balance of the term of the sentence imposed must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period, unless the there are special circumstances for it being more. Section 47 permits a Court to direct that a sentence commence on a date prior to sentencing and requires when a commencement date is fixed, that any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence be taken into account.

15A non-parole period, that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence, must be fixed having regard to all the purposes of sentencing, the objective seriousness of the offence and the offender's subjective circumstances (see Power v R [1974] HCA 26; (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628-629 and Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [40]). It must reflect the minimum period which justice requires that the offender serve in custody (see Muldrock v R [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [57].) 

16Here his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 1 year, 7 months, setting a commencement date which resulted in the respondent's release to parole on sentencing. That was the minimum time under the sentence that the District Court imposed that the respondent ought to have been kept in custody in relation to the offence. As the result of his Honour's approach in fact he was released to parole having been kept in custody for this offence for only some 28 days and in total for this and other offences for only 207 days. In so approaching the sentencing exercise his Honour plainly erred, with the result that the Crown appeal must be upheld and the respondent re-sentenced. 

Orders

		10 February 2014",2014-02-06 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705515,Stepanyan v R [2014] NSWCCA 7,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ AT CL: I agree with Schmidt J.

2SCHMIDT J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal a sentence of 10 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years imposed upon him by Lakatos DCJ, after he received a 10% discount for a plea of guilty to a charge of robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, the maximum penalty for which was 25 years (s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW)). The sentence was imposed on 17 May 2012, the applicant having entered the plea on 16 May 2012 on re-arraignment following an aborted trial conducted in March and April 2012. In imposing that sentence his Honour also took into account an offence of discharge firearm in a public place, which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years (s 33 of the Crimes Act), on a Form 1.

3Two grounds of appeal were advanced:

1. His Honour erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by the security guard, a co-offender, being shot.

2. The applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance given the degree of disparity in the starting point adopted by his Honour, in relative terms to that adopted with the co-offender Balian.

The sentencing judgment

4Lakatos DCJ noted that the offence to which the applicant had initially pleaded not guilty was that on 20 March 2009 he had robbed Scott Lee of $25,312 whilst armed with a dangerous weapon. His co-offender, Garen Balian, had been sentenced by Frearson DCJ to a total term of 3 years,10 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years, 6 months for a similar offence, after a combined discount of 55% for his plea and future assistance. That sentence reflected a notional starting point of 8 years, 6 months.

5His Honour observed that Frearson DCJ had found that Mr Balian's part in the robbery was being the driver of the getaway vehicle, he was involved in a rehearsal for the robbery and was to receive $1,300 for his efforts. In this case there was a significant contest as to the basis on which the applicant should be sentenced. His Honour observed that much of what was established on the evidence was common, but significant matters, particularly as to the roles of the applicant and Mr Balian, were in contest. 

6It was not in issue that the applicant and Mr Balian went to the Forestville RSL Club on 3 March 2009, signing in using their real names. They went again on 4 March with a third person, Harry Kradjian. The applicant and Mr Kradjian were recorded on CCTV footage on the first level which had function rooms, where they inspected some large glass windows. Mr Kradjian was then ejected from the Club and the applicant and Mr Balian went to the gaming area on the ground floor near where the safe was located and cash was held. His Honour found that they were both 'in effect casing the premises', because there was then a plan in place to rob the Club. They remained a matter of minutes, studying the security layout at various locations.

7His Honour accepted the Crown case that there was an inside man involved, a security guard named Vahe Yaacoubian, who knew the applicant through his son. Mr Yaacoubian agreed to be shot during the robbery, so that he could avoid suspicion and would receive a compensation payout from his employer. His role was to give a signal by his mobile phone as to the appropriate time for the robbery to be committed. There were a number of meetings and phone conversations beforehand, in which he and the applicant planned the robbery. 

8It was decided to gain entry to the Club by removing a large pane of glass leading to the function rooms. His Honour accepted Mr Balian's evidence that it was the applicant who engaged a glazier to help remove the glass and that another offender, Mr Kashadorian, was to provide the getaway car, even though he was later acquitted of the charges brought against him. 

9Mr Balian's role was to drive Mr Kashadorian's car, waiting outside the Club while the robbery took place. Another co-offender Masis Berberian, was to keep a lookout a couple of blocks away and to pick up the man who was to burn the car. He was to receive $1,000 for his assistance.

10The offenders met before the robbery. His Honour found that their discussions included that the applicant and Mr Koupilian were armed with pistols, at least one of which was real and in working order.

11The applicant and two others, one a glazier, removed the window pane. There were a number of patrons and employees present when the applicant and Mr Koupilian, who were both armed, entered the Club at about 1.10 am. The two offenders hid until 1.40 am, waiting for the signal which Mr Yaacoubian gave by mobile phone, indicating that only he and the duty manager, Mr Lee, remained on the premises. They then donned balaclavas, which completely covered their faces. 

12The robbery was captured on CCTV. Lakatos DCJ found that while the evidence did not establish who it was that fired the shot which wounded Mr Yaacoubian, the applicant or Mr Koupilian, they were acting in concert and that accordingly, the applicant was criminally liable for the results of that conduct, no matter who fired the shot.

13The shot was fired after the applicant and Mr Koupilian went to the ground floor where they pursued Mr Yaacoubian to the bar where Mr Lee was closing up. They both huddled on the ground, offering no resistance. One of the offenders then shot at Mr Yaacoubian with a small calibre silver coloured revolver, grazing his left thigh. Mr Yaacoubian and Mr Lee were then escorted to an area near the vault. Mr Lee was placed on the ground and his hands secured with gaffer tape. There was a brief struggle between Mr Yaacoubian and one offender, while the other attempted to fire several bullets at him. A number of shots failed to discharge before one shot penetrated Mr Yaacoubian's right rear thigh, coming to rest behind his knee. He was placed on the ground, his hands and feet were also gaffer taped and one of the offenders used his belt as a tourniquet.

14Mr Lee was told to open the safe and that if his swipe card failed, he would be killed. Access was gained and $25,312 in various denominations taken. $180,000 earlier deposited in a time lock safe was inaccessible. The applicant and the other offender then left through the window. The getaway car was driven to Cammeray where it was burnt by another offender named Troy. He was driven away by Mr Berberian. 

15The applicant was arrested in October 2009, but declined to be interviewed. He gave evidence at the aborted trial. 

16His Honour rejected the applicant's case that his offence was on par with that of Mr Balian, with the result that given that his offence was no more serious, the starting point for his sentence should be the same as that of Mr Balian's sentence. 

17His Honour noted that at the aborted trial Mr Balian and Mr Berberian had given consistent evidence that they were both co-opted by the applicant, who falsely gave evidence denying any part in the offence or its planning. His Honour accepted that this did not give the evidence which Mr Balian and Mr Berberian had given any greater support as to their respective roles. Nevertheless, he took the view that nothing which the applicant had said could have the effect of impugning their evidence, putting aside legitimate criticisms which could be made as to their evidence and its quality. His Honour was not, however, prepared to accept the parts of their evidence which supported the applicant's case and to reject parts which did not, notwithstanding the caution which had to be adopted to their evidence, given that they were accomplices.

18His Honour accepted the Crown's concession that the evidence had not established that the applicant had entered the Club before the offence using a false name and address. He declined to make any finding as to which offender was then 'more substantially casing the place out', which he considered was subsumed in his finding as to who the organiser of this criminal enterprise was.

19His Honour also rejected the assertion that at the earlier trial he had made a ruling that the evidence of Mr Yaacoubian could not go to the jury because it was 'so unreliable and probably the result of an interest in attempting to mitigate his own role and/or justify his involvement'. He explained that he had then had doubts that the police had taken all reasonable steps to secure Mr Yaacoubian's attendance, without success and further, that he considered that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by unfair prejudice to the applicant, because his account could not be tested by cross-examination and that as a result, there was a risk that the jury could misuse the evidence.

20His Honour noted that Mr Yaacoubian's untested assertion that it was the applicant who had approached him to become involved was consistent with the sworn evidence of the other co-accused as to how they were approached. He thus concluded that the applicant had also approached Mr Yaacoubian to become involved. He also accepted the evidence of Mr Balian that the applicant had initiated the plan to rob the Club and had organised a number of essential steps taken before the robbery, in which he found that Mr Balian had assisted, including by the acquisition of a firearm and the balaclavas and in helping to case the premises. 

21His Honour rejected the submission that Mr Balian's role had been significantly underplayed by the Crown or that the proper starting point for the applicant's sentence was equivalent to that of Mr Balian, having considered their respective roles. 

22He was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant, along perhaps with Mr Koupilian, was the principal who selected the venue to be robbed, formulated or assisted in formulating the plan to be implemented, enlisted the aid of others and dispensed the proceeds, to at least some of the co-offenders. He thus considered that the applicant was one step above Mr Balian in the enterprise and accordingly rejected the contention that the proper starting point for their sentences should be equivalent. 

23His Honour noted in relation to the evidence as to the acquisition of the weapon that Mr Balian's role had been to purchase a firearm after the applicant had attempted to acquire a gun, but had been robbed in the process. He noted that this would not have been known, but for Mr Balian's evidence. It was an admission made against interest, which he had volunteered. There were others. His evidence was that he and the applicant were friends at school. The applicant had told him about the robbery about a month before. He wanted Mr Balian to be one of the principal perpetrators, but he declined. He did agree to become the driver and attended a number of meetings with the applicant and others involved, beforehand. It was the applicant and Mr Koupilian who were giving the directions. He helped acquire a firearm after the applicant had tried unsuccessfully to get one. He also suggested where balaclavas could be obtained from a ski shop at Chatswood.

24Mr Balian attended the Club on 4 March with the offender, who wanted to look at the window and cameras. Because the window was too thick to smash, the applicant got a glazier to pull it out at night. The applicant informed him when the offence was to occur. He helped arrange a safe house near the Club and received $1,500 for his assistance.

25His Honour also had regard to Mr Berberian's evidence that he knew both the applicant and Mr Balian from school. It was the applicant who told him about the offence a few days beforehand, and asked for his help as a lookout for $1,000. He told him where to meet on the night of the robbery and spoke to him some 5 days later and ultimately paid the $1,000 as promised. His Honour considered that evidence supported his conclusion as to Mr Balian's role.

26His Honour accepted that how Mr Balian had supplied information to police had not been straightforward or entirely forthcoming, having at early stages of the investigations withheld evidence and having later supplied evidence against those whom he knew police were aware of. Nevertheless, he noted that his evidence was consistent with that of other offenders and that such help as he had given, related to less significant parts of the criminal enterprise. His Honour compared the applicant's selection of the target, casing the premises, arranging the point of entry, enlisting a glazier and distributing the proceeds, with Mr Balian sourcing the balaclavas, driving to and from the Club and acquiring one of the weapons ultimately used. 

27His Honour also considered relevant subjective matters, including the applicant's record, as well as the report of the psychologist Ms Hopkins, which provided information as to his personal background. That included information as to his modest alcohol use between 16 and 20 years of age; increasing consumption of marijuana from age 18; and cocaine use from age 19; as well as a gambling problem developed from age 18. This problem resulted in the applicant at one time using his entire financial resources at the Star City Casino and later gambling up to $15,000 in one hand at the Crown Casino in Melbourne, as well as gambling with considerable borrowings from his parents and brother. His Honour found that while casino records in evidence established gambling of some $123,750 in 2008 and winnings of $41,435, they did not establish the extent of the losses the applicant claimed to have suffered shortly before this offence in the history given to the psychologist.

28His Honour also noted that the account given of the applicant's knowledge of the firearm used in the offence did not accord with the evidence at trial, consistent with the false evidence he had earlier given. His Honour concluded from this evidence that the applicant had neither remorse nor an acceptance of responsibility for his offence, noting the approach he had adopted to the sentencing proceedings, namely a disclosure of only that which was known. In the result his Honour was reticent to accept material which the applicant put forward, which did not have independent support. This had adverse consequences for his assessment of the applicant's good intentions and rehabilitation. Absent sworn evidence his Honour did not accept that what the applicant had told the psychologist as to his contrition was honest. Nor did he accept a handwritten letter expressing his remorse to have been given honestly and bona fide.

29His Honour observed that the applicant had gambled over $110,000 per year in both 2008 and 2009, which explained his resort to unlawful activities to acquire the funds he needed. He also noted the evidence that he had attended the Crown Casino with co-offenders, which he considered supported the proposition that he had had a significant role in eliciting their assistance.

30In considering aggravating and mitigating matters, his Honour took into account the actual use of violence and the fact that the robbery was committed in company, while the applicant was on conditional liberty. As to mitigating matters, his Honour made no positive findings as to either rehabilitation or the possibility of re-offending. Nor did his Honour accept the case advanced that leniency was warranted by reason of difficulties being experienced in custody as the result of the applicant's orthodontic problems.

31His Honour took account of the factors identified in the guideline judgment R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, (1999) 46 NSWLR 346, which is directed at the s 97(1) armed robbery offence and identified mitigating and aggravating factors to be taken into account in sentencing for such offences. He noted that the applicant was a comparatively young offender; that he had a significant, albeit not a long criminal record; the use of a weapon; significant planning; and actual violence, albeit perpetrated on a person involved in the criminal activity, who 'may well have expected it to happen'. He also considered the effect that the violence had on Mr Lee, who was clearly in a vulnerable position, as well as the moderate amount stolen; the use of the firearm; and the number of offenders involved.

32After reiterating the reasons why he had concluded that the applicant's role was more significant than that of Mr Balian, who had not had offences on a Form 1 to take into account, his Honour concluded that the seriousness of what had been a carefully planned, calculated and violent robbery which but for the time lock safe would have secured greater rewards was high. It called for significant recognition of special and general deterrence in the sentence imposed. Special circumstances were found, recognising the applicant's youth and his need for rehabilitation to help overcome his drug and alcohol and gambling addictions. The result was that a longer than normal non-parole period was imposed.

33The 10 year sentence imposed after a 10% discount, with a 7 year non-parole period was fixed to commence from the date the applicant was taken into custody on 9 October 2009.

Ground 1 - His Honour erred in finding that the offence was aggravated by the security guard, a co-offender, being shot

34The applicant conceded that his Honour's approach that the most relevant sentence for him to consider for comparative purposes was that imposed on Mr Balian was correct. It was submitted, however, that neither the s 97(2) offence for which the applicant was being sentenced, nor the s 33 offence being taken into account on the Form 1 involved the wounding of the security guard. That was because it was found that he had been complicit in the pre-planning of the offence. It was thus argued that his Honour had erred in concluding that the seriousness of the offence was aggravated by the fact that a person was shot.

35It was also argued that Frearson DCJ had adopted the correct approach when sentencing Mr Balian, when he observed:

""I do acknowledge that the offender is not to be punished for the shooting of the security guard and I disregard that aspect. He is to be punished for the robbery in which he participated, a robbery in which he was well aware that the persons who went in to perform the robbery were armed. I appreciate that I do not aggravate the offence by reason of the bare elements of the offence which obviously includes the robbers being armed. But I should add though that it was a robbery that involved some actual shots being discharged. It seemed to me that I can take into account the actual violence that was perpetrated and the actual things that happened in terms of discharging of shots but not the fact that the security officer was wounded and I disregard that latter aspect.""


36There are two difficulties with the applicant's reliance on these remarks. The first, that Lakatos DCJ wrongly took a different view to that of Frearson DCJ, is not made out by a fair reading of his Honour's sentencing remarks. The second, that it is not clear that Frearson DCJ's approach was correct.

37The applicant was being sentenced for an offence under s 97(2) of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon. The offences established by s 97 of the Crimes Act are:

""97 Robbery etc or stopping a mail, being armed or in company

(1) Whosoever, being armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument, or being in company with another person,
robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person, or stops any mail, or vehicle, railway train, or person conveying a mail, with intent to rob, or search the same, shall be liable to imprisonment for twenty years.

(2) Aggravated offence

A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) when armed with a dangerous weapon. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.""


38In determining this sentence his Honour had regard to the R v Henry guideline judgement, where Spigelman CJ identified at [162] s 97(1) cases with common characteristics warranting a custodial sentence in the range of 4 and 5 years. They were:
""(i) Young offender with no or little criminal history

(ii) Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury

(iii) Limited degree of planning

(iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof

(v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver

(vi) Small amount taken

(vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.""


39Spigelman CJ also discussed mitigating and aggravating factors which would warrant sentences falling below or above that range:

""169 Aggravating and mitigating factors will justify a sentence below or above the range, as this Court's prior decisions indicate. The narrow range is a starting point. 

170 In addition to factors which may arise in any case eg youth, offender's criminal record, cooperation with authorities, guilty plea in the absence of a strong case, rehabilitation efforts, offence committed whilst on bail etc, a number of circumstances are particular to the offence of armed robbery. These include: 

(i) Nature of the weapon 

(ii) Vulnerability of the victim 

(iii) Position on a scale of impulsiveness/planning 

(iv) Intensity of threat, or actual use, of force 

(v) Number of offenders 

(vi) Amount taken 

(vii) Effect on victim(s)""


40That approach accords with the requirements of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), which requires that relevant and known mitigating and aggravating factors to be taken into account on sentencing. They include that the offence involved the actual or threatened use of violence (s 21A(3)(b))and the actual or threatened use of a weapon (s 21A(3)(c)).

41Here the evidence established that not only were the applicant and Mr Koupilian armed with guns, but that threatened and actual violence was used towards both Mr Lee and Mr Yaacoubian, who were both taken to the safe, pushed to the ground and gaffer taped. Mr Lee was then threatened that he would be killed and Mr Yaacoubian was actually shot. That was done in order not only to help intimidate Mr Lee, but also to conceal Mr Yaacoubian's involvement in the robbery and to help him further his other aim, of falsely making a compensation claim from his employer. That was plainly to be a part of his reward for his participation in the robbery.

42That it was planned by the co-offenders, who included Mr Yaacoubian, that he would be shot, did not make this evidence irrelevant to the sentencing task which his Honour had to undertake. To the contrary, it plainly revealed aggravating matters which did not form an element of the s 97(2) offence. It was evidence which could not properly be ignored. Nor could it be suggested that taking these matters into account would have been wrong, because it would have warranted the applicant's conviction with respect to a more serious offence, contrary to the principles stated in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383. 

43Under s 97(1), a robbery offence carries a maximum sentence of 20 years imprisonment. Such an offence is aggravated if carried out by a person armed with a dangerous weapon, in which event the maximum penalty is 25 years. Under s 98, an offender who commits a robbery when so armed and also immediately before, or at the time of, or immediately after the robbery, also wounds, or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon that person, is also liable to a maximum term of imprisonment of 25 years.

44It follows that if his Honour had taken the shooting of Mr Yaacoubian into account as an aggravating matter, he would not have erred. It does not, however, appear that he did so. His Honour not only considered the sentence imposed by Frearson DCJ on Mr Balian, he said a relevant aggravating factor was the use of violence, noting that:

""A weapon was used...there was actual violence rather than a threat of it albeit I note that the violence was perpetrated on a person, so the Crown contends and I accept was party to this criminal activity and may well have expected it to have happened. However, I am bound to take into account the effect that such violence would have had on Mr Lee who observed it occurring and did not know if it was indeed the case that this was an inside job. The victim was clearly in a vulnerable position, he being a Bar Manager at a hotel when, on that occasion, there was nobody else present.""


45Contrary to his Honour's observations it was in fact common ground that Mr Yaacoubian had consented to being shot. His Honour, however, finally identified one of the key features of the offence to have been 'the use of a loaded firearm and its discharge, placing the victim in fear and ensuring his compliance'. That was clearly a reference to Mr Lee, not Mr Yaacoubian.

46In so approaching this sentencing task his Honour did not fall into the error on which the applicant relied. In the result this ground was not established.

Ground 2 - The applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance given the degree of disparity in the starting point adopted by his Honour, in relative terms to that adopted with the co-offender Balian

47The applicant did not challenge his Honour's findings that he was one of the principals in this criminal enterprise, and thus one step higher in the hierarchy than Mr Balian, or that this had to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise. That the s 33 offence also had to be taken into account in the sentence imposed upon him, with the result an increase in the relative starting point of his sentence, was also accepted. It was, however, submitted that the disparity in the starting points for the two sentencing exercises, of 8 years, 6 months in Mr Balian's case and 10 years in the applicant's was too great, despite these differences. 

48The applicant's case was that Mr Balian had been:

""i. Involved in the planning of the robbery and prior surveillance of the target.

ii. He drove on three occasions to meet the security guard.

iii. He organised the gun and purchased the balaclavas.

iv. Agreed to drive the getaway car and arranged the safe house; and

v. While he distanced himself from the actual events inside the club he knew the plan was that the security guard was to be shot and the manager threatened. Further, by being outside he minimized his risk of exposure to detection.""


49Mr Balian also knew that it was planned that Mr Yaacoubian would be shot. He was otherwise a willing participant in the robbery he had helped plan. It was submitted that it followed that Mr Balian's level of criminality was thus not substantially lower than that of the applicant. It was also relevant that he had a significantly more serious criminal record than that of the applicant, which together should have resulted in a lower sentence than that imposed on the applicant. 

50At the time of the robbery the applicant, who was aged 20 years was subject to two bonds for driving offences, while Mr Balian, who was aged 22 years was on parole for armed robbery, having been released to 15 months parole on 15 February 2008. Mr Balian was thus 2 years older than the applicant and had a more serious record, having already served terms of imprisonment for break enter and steal offences, while the applicant had only a robbery with offensive weapon offence as a juvenile, for which he was ordered to serve 40 hours community service, an affray for which he had a s 9 bond and driving offences. It was argued that this difference should have been reflected in a lower relative starting point for the applicant's offence. The evidence as to problems he was experiencing with orthodontic problems should also have had an impact on that outcome.

51In the result the applicant submitted that his Honour had not properly observed the principle of parity in sentencing, leaving him with a justifiable sense of grievance, as discussed in Jimmy v Regina [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540. 

52In that case Campbell JA referred to what was discussed by Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson J agreed) in Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 as to the operation of the parity principle in the case of two people who had co-operated in the one criminal enterprise, although playing different roles in it. There it was observed at 609:

""The true position in my opinion may be briefly stated as follows. It is obviously desirable that persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence, have to be taken into account."" (emphasis added)


53Those considerations explain the difference in the sentences imposed on these two offenders, as does the Form 1 offence for which the applicant was being sentenced. As reiterated in Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 at [31]: 
""The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention [in a severity appeal] with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise.""


54This was unquestionably a very serious, planned offence committed by a number of offenders, the younger applicant being found to have been one of the principals and Mr Balian, who had a more serious record and was on parole, having taken a lesser role in the enterprise. The sentence imposed on Mr Balian had to reflect the common purpose which he and his co-offenders had pursued and that they were to be sentenced for the full range of the criminal acts done by any of them in carrying out that purpose, but he was not necessarily to receive the same punishment as would have been appropriate, if he had personally performed all of those acts (see R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3 at [28] - [32]). Importantly in this case he was not one of those involved in the repeated discharge of the firearm and the shooting engaged in to wound Mr Yaacoubian and to intimidate Mr Lee. That had to be taken into account when Mr Balian was sentenced. 

55That the applicant was personally involved in all of these acts did have to be taken into account when he was sentenced, as did his greater role in the enterprise. That had to result in a higher sentence in his case. 

56Further, in this case, not only were the circumstances in which their pleas were entered such that in the applicant's case only a discount of 10% was warranted, while in Mr Balian's case a 55% discount was warranted, but very different conclusions were reached as to the evidence given by Mr Balian, which was accepted and the views reached as to the reliability of the information put before the court on sentencing by the applicant, who had earlier given false evidence at the aborted trial and had not himself given evidence at the sentencing hearing. That had an impact on his Honour's approach to the evidence as to his personal circumstances and the relevant mitigating matters which had to be taken into account when sentencing the applicant, which did not arise in Mr Balian's case.

57That this Honour erred in the conclusions which he reached, so as to have given rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the applicant's part, was not shown. As Spigelman CJ observed in Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 (Simpson J agreeing) a (46):

""Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts. This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion. The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour."" 


58That his Honour's characterisation of the applicant's role and the acts for which he had to be held accountable and how that should be reflected in the sentence imposed upon him were wrong, was not established. His Honour's conclusions accorded with those reached by Frearson DCJ, who found that Mr Balian's role had been limited, namely that of a driver who chose not to go into the Club. While he was a participant in a well planned armed robbery involving a number of offenders and threatened and foreseeable violence, this was accepted as providing some limited amelioration of his sentence. Such a conclusion was not available to the applicant. 

59The differences in the two offenders' respective criminal records was apparent and a relevant matter taken into account, but in the face of the other matters which had to be taken into account in this sentencing exercise, including the other aggravating and mitigating matters which his Honour discussed and the Form 1 offence, that his Honour erred in rejecting the outcome for which the applicant contended and imposing the higher sentence which resulted, has not been established. 

60It may not be overlooked that the increase in the sentence warranted by the Form 1 offence was not necessarily small. It was a serious offence carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years. As Hoeben J discussed in Dionys v R [2011] NSWCCA 272 at [64] - [65]:

""64 The observations of Spigelman CJ in the guideline case go further than was set out in the applicant's submissions. The following extracts indicate his Honour's view as to the extent to which Form 1 matters can affect the length of a sentence: 

""18 A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. (See e.g. The Queen v White (1981) 28 SASR 9 at 13; Murrell v The Queen [1985] FCA 14; (1985) 4 FCR 168 at 179 per Blackburn J; R v Vougdis (1989) 41 A Crim R 125 at 128-129; R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371-372.) 
... 

42 The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another. 

43 I did not intend these observations to be exhaustive of the elements upon which the fact of other offences may impinge. However, no additional elements for which that could be so have been identified in submissions to this Court. The important point is that the focus throughout must be on sentencing for the primary offence."" 

65 What is clear from the above paragraphs is that while the Court is sentencing only for the principal offence and not for the Form 1 offences, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence and that the additional component may not be small. While not excluding other considerations, the Chief Justice referred specifically to greater weight being given to personal deterrence and to ""the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed.""


61In this case the increase in the sentence imposed on the applicant to reflect the serious Form 1 offence which was being taken into account, plainly had to result in a substantial increase in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed upon him. His Honour correctly concluded that the sentence had to have particular regard to both elements of general and specific deterrence. In the result, in my view, it must also be concluded that this ground was not established.

Orders

62For these reasons, I would make the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal allowed. 
2. Appeal dismissed.


63BARR AJ: I agree with Schmidt J.

		20 February 2014",2014-02-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705516,"EL-HELOU, Gary - Application pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2014] NSWSC 66","Judgment

1This is an application pursuant to Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (""the Act"") for the referral of a sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The application has been made on behalf of Gary El-Helou (""the applicant""). The key legislative provisions are as follows: 

""78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

...

79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

...""

2The application has two bases. The first is that, after an application for leave to appeal against sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal was no longer available to the applicant, a sentence was imposed on a co-offender that is said to give rise to a ""doubt or question"" as to whether erroneous disparity may be demonstrated between the sentences imposed upon the two offenders.

3The second basis is said to be evidence that was not before the learned sentencing Judge that raises a doubt or question about a finding of fact made by his Honour that was adverse to the applicant.

4The application consists of written submissions prepared by senior counsel for the applicant that attach and refer to a number of documents that establish the relevant background. 

5The Crown Advocate and junior counsel have also provided helpful written submissions. In those submissions, the Crown Advocate accepts that it would be open to me to experience a doubt or question founded on the first basis. However, the Crown Advocate resists the submission of senior counsel for the applicant that I would experience a doubt or question founded upon the second basis.

Chronological background

6On 10 July 2009 in the District Court of New South Wales, Judge Solomon sentenced the applicant for a single offence. That offence was knowingly taking part in the supply of not less than the large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug; namely, pseudoephedrine. The applicant had pleaded guilty to that offence in the Local Court.

7The applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for life. There was also an applicable standard non-parole period of 15 years. 

8To state the facts found by his Honour very succinctly, the applicant was the ""transporter"" and ""warehouseman"" with regard to 259kg of pseudoephedrine, which is a well-known precursor to the prohibited drug methylamphetamine (""meth""). The applicant permitted his garage to be used as a place of storage with regard to an illicit importation of a very large quantity of pseudoephedrine that had been detected and disrupted by the Australian Federal Police.

9His Honour rejected the evidence of the applicant that he was to be paid the relatively paltry sum of $2000 for his involvement, in light of the massive value of the chemical in question. His Honour also rejected the evidence of the applicant that, during the vast majority of his involvement, he believed that he was involving himself in criminality with regard to steroids only. Contrary to the evidence of the applicant and the submissions of his counsel, His Honour found that the applicant had a ""deep knowledge"" of the criminal enterprise.

10However, his Honour accepted that one could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was involved in the crime for more than two days.

11As far as subjective aspects are concerned, the applicant was a person of good character. A family business had failed and that was the context for his crime. He did not have a problem with drugs or alcohol. He received a discount of 25 per cent for the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. His Honour found that the applicant was remorseful, and possessed good prospects of rehabilitation. Special circumstances were found that permitted a variation in the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period.

12Judge Solomon imposed a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months, each to commence on 11 July 2008. The head sentence was to expire on 10 January 2019, and the non-parole period was to expire on 10 January 2015.

13Despite his plea of guilty, the applicant appealed against conviction to the Court of Criminal Appeal. That appeal was founded upon constitutional arguments. As well, the Crown brought an appeal founded on an asserted failure by the sentencing Judge to pay proper regard to the standard non-parole period, and asserted manifest inadequacy of sentence to the same Court.

14On 21 April 2010, that Court delivered its judgment. The appeal against conviction was dismissed. The Crown appeal was allowed. The Court of Criminal Appeal re-sentenced the applicant to a head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years, each (as before) to commence on 11 July 2008. The head sentence expires on 10 July 2020, and the non-parole period expires on 10 July 2016. That is the sentence to which the applicant is currently subject.

15On 16 December 2010 in the District Court of New South Wales, her Honour Judge Hock sentenced Constantine Anagnostopoulos for two offences to which he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. (Although Constantine Anagnostopoulos was not a co-offender of the applicant with regard to those two offences, for reasons that will become apparent shortly it is convenient to refer to him as ""the co-offender"".)

16The first offence was importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor; namely, pseudoephedrine. The maximum penalty for that Commonwealth offence was imprisonment for 25 years and a very large fine.

17The second offence was dealing with the proceeds of crime, being money worth $100,000 or more. The maximum penalty for that Commonwealth offence is imprisonment for 20 years and a very large fine.

18To state the facts very simply, the co-offender was the principal in the importation of over 839kg of tablets of pseudoephedrine by way of three international consignments. He expected a profit of over $300,000. The pure pseudoephedrine amounted to over 117kg. That amount of the chemical could have led to the manufacture of between 66kg and 108kg of meth, with a street of value between $10 million and $19 million.

19Her Honour found that the co-offender played a ""very significant role in the importation and used the legitimate history of his business ... as a cover for the importation"".

20With regard to the second offence, on arrest the co-offender was found to be in possession of $230,000 in cash that was the proceeds of crime.

21Subjectively, the co-offender was aged 39 years and had no prior convictions. A business venture was at first successful but had ultimately failed. He had developed a problem with the prohibited drug cocaine. Her Honour referred to there being evidence of remorse on the part of the co-offender. The sentences were reduced by 35 per cent in order to reflect not only the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty but also material in a confidential exhibit.

22With regard to the importation, a head sentence of imprisonment for 11 years to date from 11 July 2008 was imposed. With regard to the second offence of dealing with the proceeds of crime, a shorter head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years and 6 months, to commence on the same date, was imposed. It can be seen that the operative head sentence is imprisonment for 11 years, and that it will expire on 10 July 2019. 

23Pursuant to the Commonwealth sentencing regime, her Honour imposed a single non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months to date from the same date. That non-parole period will expire on 10 January 2015.

24On 5 October 2011, the decision of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120 was handed down.

25On 1 June 2012, his Honour Judge Solomon sentenced the co-offender in the District Court of New South Wales for a single offence. That was an offence of supplying not less than a large commercial quantity of the prohibited drug pseudoephedrine. Again, the applicable maximum penalty was imprisonment for life, and there was also an applicable standard non-parole period of 15 years.

26The subject matter of that offence included, but went beyond, the 259kg that was the subject matter of the offence for which the applicant had been sentenced by his Honour in 2009. The offence was founded on two discrete acts of supply. The first was the supply of about 323kg of a substance that the co-offender believed to be pseudoephedrine. The second was the supply to the applicant of 259kg of a substance that the co-offender believed to be the same precursor.

27The subject matter of the single count for which the co-offender was sentenced by his Honour Judge Solomon was a portion of the pseudoephedrine that he had imported and from which he had benefited financially, and for which he had been sentenced by her Honour Judge Hock.

28His Honour found that the co-offender played a ""very significant role"" with regard to the drugs. That included planning for the supply of the drugs, warehousing them, arranging delivery and storage, collecting and delivering them himself, and assisting in the breaking open of crates in order to obtain access to them. His Honour found that the co-offender ""played a crucial and necessary role in what can be described as a large-scale commercial supply.""

29His Honour reviewed the subjective features in general conformity with the brief summary that I have provided of the subjective features found by her Honour Judge Hock.

30With regard to this offence, a plea of guilty had been entered on the day of trial. However, that was in the context of a real question about whether, in light of the fact that the co-offender had received lengthy sentences for closely related offences dealt with by her Honour Judge Hock, the Crown would continue to pursue the supply offence. In light of the utilitarian value of the plea, and the contents of the same confidential exhibit to which Judge Hock had referred, his Honour provided a combined discount of 25 per cent.

31His Honour referred to the sentence that his Honour had imposed upon the applicant three years previously, along with the fact that that sentence had been quashed by the Court of Criminal Appeal and a greater sentence substituted. Judge Solomon was aware that the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal was delivered before the judgment of the High Court of Australia in Muldrock v The Queen. In that regard, his Honour remarked ""the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision may have been different had the Court of Criminal Appeal's decision been made after the decision of the High Court in Muldrock v The Queen"".

32For the single count of supply, his Honour imposed a head sentence upon the co-offender of imprisonment for 12 years and 9 months to date from 11 July 2008. A non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months was imposed, to commence on the same date. The head sentence is to expire on 10 April 2021, and the non-parole period is to expire on 10 January 2017.

33A number of aspects of that sentence are immediately noteworthy.

34First, the head sentence of 12 years and 9 months imposed upon the co-offender is only 9 months longer than the head sentence imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal upon the applicant.

35Secondly, the non-parole period of 8 years and 6 months imposed upon the co-offender is only 6 months longer than the non-parole period imposed by the Court of Criminal Appeal upon the applicant. 

36And yet, as the very brief summaries above demonstrate, there was a marked divergence in the objective criminality of the co-offender and the applicant that favoured the applicant, and their subjective features were roughly similar.

37Thirdly, the head sentence imposed by his Honour upon the co-offender only extended the pre-existing head sentence imposed by Judge Hock by a period of 1 year 9 months (that is, from 10 July 2019 to 10 April 2021). And the sentence imposed by his Honour upon the co-offender only extended his pre-existing non-parole period by a period of 2 years (that is, from 10 January 2015 to 10 January 2017).

38The final piece of the chronological background is that, on 10 October 2012, the current solicitor for the applicant swore an affidavit to the effect that he had received from the previous solicitors for the applicant a disk that contained listening device product. The product is a record of a conversation between the applicant and the co-offender that occurred on 11 July 2008. Senior counsel for the applicant submits, in short, that the listening device product calls into question the finding by his Honour in the remarks on sentence of 10 July 2009 that the applicant possessed a ""deep knowledge"" of the criminality with which he had involved himself.

Submissions with regard to the asserted first basis for referral

39Senior counsel for the applicant submits that, in light of the Crown appeal having been determined against him, the applicant does not have available to him an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal founded on erroneous disparity said to arise from the sentence subsequently imposed upon the co-offender.

40And yet, as events have subsequently transpired, he submits that there is now a real question about the sentence imposed upon the applicant. On any objective measure, the co-offender was very much more culpable than the applicant, and the subjective circumstances of the two men were roughly equivalent. Despite those facts, the head sentence and non-parole period imposed upon the co-offender for the supply that reflected the offence of the applicant (and indeed went beyond it to include an entirely separate act of supply) are only marginally longer than the head sentence and non-parole period imposed upon the applicant.

41Not only that, as a matter of practical reality (in the sense of extra time actually to be served in custody), in light of the sentences imposed by Judge Hock, the sentence imposed by his Honour upon the co-offender for the criminality encompassed by the supply is far shorter than that imposed upon the applicant. Senior counsel referred in that regard to Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295.

42Finally, senior counsel submitted that a referral was made to the Court of Criminal Appeal in similar circumstances in R v Yin [2007] NSWCCA 350.

43In short, senior counsel for the applicant submits that I would experience a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance in the case, founded upon the proposition that there could well be erroneous disparity, in light of subsequent events, that has worked a real injustice to the applicant.

44As I have indicated, the Crown Advocate and her junior did not dispute that it would be open to me to experience a doubt or question about the first issue identified by senior counsel for the applicant.

Determination with regard to first asserted basis for referral

45I respectfully accept the submission of senior counsel for the applicant that is not, in a practical sense, the subject of opposition. I experience a doubt and a question (in the sense of a feeling of unease or disquiet: see Varley v Attorney-General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30) about a mitigating feature of the sentence imposed upon the applicant.

46The recent decision of Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383 establishes that, in the context of an application such as this, such doubts with regard to sentences can extend beyond matters of fact to include questions of law. In these circumstances, I consider that there is no need for me to seek to classify questions of erroneous disparity founded on subsequent sentences as questions of fact, questions of law, or questions of mixed fact and law.

47That decision also establishes that the doctrine of finality should not inflexibly stand in the way of such referrals with regard to sentences.

48Finally, that decision also demonstrates that ""Muldrock error"" can form a basis of referral. Although the applicant in this case relies primarily upon an assertion of erroneous disparity founded upon the sentence imposed upon the co-offender subsequent to the disposition of the applicant's matter in the Court of Criminal Appeal, there remains a flavour of ""Muldrock error"" that perhaps underpins and explains the seeming inconsistency between the sentence imposed upon the applicant and the sentence imposed upon the co-offender. As I have indicated, his Honour and the Court of Criminal Appeal sentenced the applicant in accordance with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; but his Honour, years later, sentenced the co-offender in accordance with Muldrock v The Queen.

49Further, senior counsel for the applicant is correct in saying that a referral pursuant to Part 7 of the Act was made in similar circumstances in R v Yin.

50I do not consider that there is any reason why, in the exercise of my discretion, I should decline to refer the matter, having experienced the question or doubt to which I have referred.

51In short, I consider that there should be a referral on the first basis.

Determination with regard to second asserted basis of referral

52The second asserted basis for referral does not require a lengthy analysis by me. That is because, the first basis having been established, s 79(1)(b) speaks of referral of ""the whole case"" to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Accordingly, I am neither required nor empowered to decide that some but not other aspects of the matter should be referred to that Court, or that some but not other grounds may be relied upon there.

53But it may be convenient for me to state that, having read the agreed facts that were placed before his Honour in the proceedings on sentence, the evidence on oath of the applicant in those proceedings, and the material now relied upon. My own view is that the sworn evidence of the applicant strained credulity to a marked degree; that it was perfectly open to His Honour to reject it; that some of the findings of fact of his Honour were generous to the applicant; and that the material now relied upon is by no means conclusive proof that the finding of fact about which complaint is now made is wrong. Indeed, many parts of that material are notably contrary to the proposition that the applicant was a person of good character who involved himself in very serious criminality fleetingly and more or less unintentionally.

Order

54Pursuant to s 79(1)(b) of the Crimes (Appeal And Review) Act 2001, the whole case is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal against sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

		12 February 2014",2014-02-06 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705526,R v Rawlinson; R v Proud; R v Spicer [2014] NSWSC 149,"EX TEMPORE Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: This trial is currently in its fifth day and second calendar week. The proceedings got underway last Tuesday following the unfortunate discharge of the jury empanelled on the first day. 

2During the course of the four days utilised in this Court in these trials last week the matter proceeded - to my mind at least - in a very efficient fashion with the disposition of 27 witnesses who gave evidence in Court or by statement as well as with the tender of some documentary and electronic exhibits. 

3At the commencement of proceedings today, I was informed that the next witness is a Ms Lynette Howard. I am informed that Ms Howard is the mother of Wendy Evans, a woman who has received significant mention from many witnesses during the course of the evidence taken last week. 

4Ms Evans is significant in the scheme of things in as much as she has pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased which is the same charge upon which the accused are all facing trial.

5In the events that have occurred, the Crown has quite properly drawn to my attention a matter that came to his notice, being that Ms Howard is a member of a sporting or social club and sits as the president of that club on the same committee as one of the jurors. That juror is the secretary of the club. That club operates in the local geographical and social precinct. 

6The Crown has indicated that in the circumstances the continuation of this trial with this jury has been actually or potentially imperilled. I raised with counsel the prospect that a solution to the problem could lie in declining to call the prospective witness. That solution upon reflection and with the benefit of submissions from counsel is indeed no solution at all. That is partly if not principally for the reason that the notoriety of Ms Evans in the scheme of things so far and the potential relationship between the juror and her mother however close or distant, raises a significant and troublesome perception. It goes without saying that the appearance that this trial operates according to the rules is as important as the fact that it should actually do so. 

7The Crown raised with me the possibility that, in accordance with authority, I could take the course of interrogating the juror with a view to ascertaining if possible whether the other jurors knew about the relationship. As superficially attractive and practically helpful as that approach may at first sight appear to be, it remains in my view troubled by the same problem. Human nature being what it is, doubts could remain about the veracity of any denials by that juror that other members of the jury had already been told. 

8Counsel for each of the accused has indicated in helpful submissions to me that in the circumstances there is no option but to discharge this jury. As unfortunate and inconvenient as that outcome may appear to be, the guarantee that the accused should obtain a trial that is not only fair, but which also appears to be fair, is paramount and should prevail to the exclusion of all other factors. 

9In the circumstances I consider that there is no alternative but to discharge the jury and to commence these trials afresh as soon as it is possible to do so. I will raise with counsel in due course the practical matters attending the recommencement of this trial.

		09 December 2014",2014-02-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705532,R v Paterson (No 3) [2014] NSWSC 57,"Judgment1Prior to the empanelment of the jury in this matter Mr Stratton SC, who appears on behalf of the accused, raised an issue concerning the operation of s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (""the Act"") which is in the following terms:
293 Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience (1) This section applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence. 
(2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible. 
(3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 
(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 
(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, is inadmissible. 
(4) Subsection (3) does not apply: 
(a) if the evidence: 
(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 
(ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 
(b) if the evidence relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant, 
(c) if: 
(i) the accused person is alleged to have had sexual intercourse (as defined in section 61H (1) of the Crimes Act 1900 ) with the complainant, and the accused person does not concede the sexual intercourse so alleged, and 
(ii) the evidence is relevant to whether the presence of semen, pregnancy, disease or injury is attributable to the sexual intercourse alleged to have been had by the accused person, 
(d) if the evidence is relevant to: 
(i) whether at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence there was present in the complainant a disease that, at any relevant time, was absent in the accused person, or 
(ii) whether at any relevant time there was absent in the complainant a disease that, at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, was present in the accused person, 
(e) if the evidence is relevant to whether the allegation that the prescribed sexual offence was committed by the accused person was first made following a realisation or discovery of the presence of pregnancy or disease in the complainant (being a realisation or discovery that took place after the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence), 
(f) if the evidence has been given by the complainant in cross-examination by or on behalf of the accused person, being evidence given in answer to a question that may, pursuant to subsection (6), be asked, and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 
(5) A witness must not be asked: 
(a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or 
(b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. 
(6) If the court is satisfied: 
(a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period: 
(i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
(ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 
(b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication, the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified. 
(7) On the trial of a person, any question as to the admissibility of evidence under subsection (2) or (3) or the right to cross-examine under subsection (6) is to be decided by the court in the absence of the jury. 
(8) If the court decides that evidence is admissible under subsection (4), the court must, before the evidence is given, record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible and the reasons for that decision.
2The effect of s 293 (2) and (3) is to render, amongst other things, evidence relating to the sexual reputation, experience or activity of a complainant inadmissible.  Section 293(4) creates a number of exceptions to the operation of those earlier provisions.  In the event that I come to the view that the evidence is admissible I am obliged by s. 293(8) of the Act to record or cause to be recorded in writing, prior to the evidence being given, the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible and the reasons that I have reached that decision. 
3A summary of the case brought by the Crown, as well as a summary of the case for the accused, are set out in an earlier judgment given in this matter in relation to a number of evidentiary issues (see R v Paterson [2014] NSWSC 29 at [3] to [17].)  
4It will be evident from those paragraphs that it is part of the Crown case that the deceased was sexually assaulted, without her consent, by the accused and others shortly prior to her death. That alleged sexual assault includes allegations of non-consensual vaginal and anal intercourse. The Crown will rely upon DNA analysis of swabs taken from the deceased to support the proposition that the accused was one of those responsible for that sexual assault.  
5The Crown will also lead evidence, from previous partners of the deceased, that she was not in the habit of engaging in consensual anal sex.  I gather that this evidence will be led by the Crown in support of an inference that the anal sex which is partly the subject of count 2 was not consensual.  In addition, there will be evidence concerning the fact that the deceased had been employed in the period leading up to her death as a sex worker.  
6It is part of the case for the accused, as I understand it, that he had consensual sex with the deceased on the day prior to her death.  As indicated to me by senior counsel for the accused, this may incorporate an assertion that this included consensual anal sex.
7Senior counsel for the accused submitted that evidence of the general nature of that to which I have referred was evidence to which s. 293(2) and/or (3) was directed.  He did not object to such evidence being given and submitted that it came within one or more of the exceptions for which provision is made in s 293(4).  In this regard he drew my attention, in particular, to the provisions of s. 293(4)(b) and (c).  
8The Crown made no submission contrary to those advanced by senior counsel for the accused.  I therefore did not understand the Crown to cavil with anything which had been put.  
9On the basis of what I understand to be the cases advanced by the Crown and the accused respectively, I am satisfied evidence of the kind to which I have referred in [5] - [7] above is evidence to which s. 293(2) and/or (3) of the Act relates.  However, I am satisfied that such evidence falls within the terms of the exceptions created by s. 293(4)(b) and or s. 293(4)(c).  I am also satisfied that the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the deceased might suffer as a result of its admission.  In this regard, I note that the deceased, on the Crown case, died some 22 years ago.  
10For these reasons I have come to the view that the evidence is admissible.
ORDER:11I make the following order:
1.The evidence is admitted.

		03 March 2014",2014-02-09 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705549,Police v ZQ [2014] NSWChC 1,"Judgment

Reasons for Decision

1The Young Person has been charged with two offences arising out of an incident that occurred on 21 June 2013 at Sylvania Waters, namely reckless wounding (Crimes Act, s 35(4)) and a back-up charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Crimes Act, s 59).

2There is no dispute that the victim, BC, suffered a 10 cm laceration to his right shoulder during the incident. There is a factual dispute as to how that injury was inflicted, the prosecution case being that the accused Young Person deliberately inflicted the injury with a broken beer bottle; the defence case being that the prosecution is unable to establish that it was not accidental. There is also a legal dispute whether the injury suffered by the victim constitutes a wounding, in the legal sense.

The legal issue - Wounding

3I propose to deal with this legal issue first.

4A great deal of the prosecution evidence was admitted by consent. In particular, and for the purposes of this aspect of the judgment, a number of colour photographs were admitted as exhibit 2, including one photograph numbered 3, which clearly and graphically depicts the injury sustained by the victim. The medical evidence, consisting of the medical certificate signed by Dr Richard Neilson, was admitted as exhibit 4.

5In paragraph 7 of the doctor's statement, it is stated that the examination of the victim in the Emergency Department revealed a ""10 cm laceration to the skin overlying the posterior aspect of the right shoulder, not extending through the dermis"". Paragraph 8 continues ""He was treated with wound closure under local anaesthesia and discharged.....""

6It was submitted by the defence, at the end of the prosecution case, that the evidence could not establish that there was a wounding (in the legal sense) in this case, having regard to the medical evidence that the laceration did not extend ""through the dermis"" (emphasis added).

7The defence relied on the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal decision of Regina -v- Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 351, at paragraph 31 where the following appears:

31. Secondly, it is instructive to examine what may amount to a ""wounding"" for the purposes of the offence of malicious wounding under s35(1) of the Act. The term is not defined by the Act. A wounding is generally assumed to be ""the infliction of an injury which breaks the continuity of the skin"" (cf R v Newman (1948) ALR 109 at 110). In R v Smith (1837) 8 Carrington & Payne 173, the prisoner was charged with assault, cutting and wounding the victim on the left side of the face. It was the Crown case that he had struck the victim with a hammer, breaking his jaw in two places. The hospital reported that the skin was broken internally, but not externally. The issue arose whether that was ""wounding"" within the Statute. The Court held it was. The case is generally cited for the following proposition (see Howie & Johnson, ""Annotated Criminal Legislation of NSW"" (2002/2003 Ed)): (p 653)

""'Wounds' is an injury involving the breaking or cutting of the interior layer of the skin (dermis) and the breaking of the outer layer (epidermis) is not sufficient.""

8The prosecution submitted that the evidence was sufficient to satisfy the Court that the injury sustained by the victim could amount to a wounding. The prosecution relied on a decision of the Tasmanian Court of Criminal Appeal, in Devine v. The Queen [1982] Tas R 155; (1982) 8 A Crim R 45. 

9In that case Green CJ found that:

""..it is sufficient if the jury are satisfied that the accused inflicted an injury which broke the skin and which penetrated below the epidermis"". (The ""epidermis"" is the outer, non-vascular, non-sensitive layer of the skin, covering the true skin or corium (dermis) [Macquarie Concise Dictionary].) 

10In the same case Cosgrove J concluded that: 

""It is neither necessary nor permissible in my opinion to construe the reference to breaking of the whole skin as the division of the dermis to its full depth"". 

11I am satisfied that the medical evidence in the present case does not amount to a conclusion that there was no breaking or cutting of the dermis, only that the laceration did not extend THROUGH the dermis. Further, accepting the oral evidence that there was a great deal of bleeding associated with the injury, and observing the injury in the photograph, I conclude that the prosecution has established that there the injury broke the skin and penetrated below the epidermis.

12Accordingly, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecution has established that there was a wounding, in the legal sense, in this case.

The factual dispute

13I now turn to the factual dispute. 

14Briefly, the prosecution case consisted of the tendering of a number of witness statements, and the oral testimony of the victim, BC, and an eyewitness, Sally. The accused did not call any evidence, as was his right - he is entitled to put the prosecution to strict proof and to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

15The accused denies causing any intentional or reckless injury to the victim, and contends that the injury was caused accidentally when the victim fell down some stairs amongst some broken glass. 

16Some thirteen witness statements were tendered as part of the prosecution brief and were marked as exhibit 1. There were ten police statements included in this exhibit, and it is not necessary to provide any particulars of the contents thereof, as they merely covered incidental issues, including the arrest and interviewing of the Young Person. The exhibit also included the statements of three civilian witnesses, MA, ME and AM. These witnesses did not testify.

17Another witness statement, that of LP, was also tendered (exhibit 7) with the witness not being called. There was evidence that a person BS was uncooperative with the police and refused to provide a statement. The evidence is that this last mentioned person was the main instigator of the incident that resulted in the injuries suffered by the victim BC.

18Briefly the facts are that during the evening of Friday 21 June 2013 a large group of young people (one estimate being about 40-50 people), mainly school friends, were gathered at an oval in Sylvania, and many of these people were drinking alcohol and were intoxicated to varying degrees. The accused Young Person and the victim BC were present. The accused Young Person had consumed a substantial amount of alcohol and was substantially intoxicated and subsequently had little memory of the events of the evening, including the incident involving the victim being injured. The victim BC had not consumed any alcohol.

19One of the members of the group, AM, extended an invitation for the gathering to continue at her residence, a two story town house, as her parents were not at home. One estimate is that about 20-30 people from the oval attended the AM home. This was around 10 pm. More alcohol was consumed at the house, and some were smoking cannabis.

20Later in the night there was a confrontation between the accused Young Person and the person BS. This occurred at the top of a flight of stairs in the AM residence. There appears to be no dispute that the person BS was the instigator of the incident, which involved BS confronting the accused Young person and being aggressive, insulting and trying to instigate a fight with the accused.

21There is no dispute that the victim, BC, who was at the bottom of the stairs, observed the confrontation between BS and the accused Young Person. The victim BC ascended the stairs and intervened by pulling the accused Young Person backwards by his shirt, and the accused Young Person fell down the stairs.

22BC gave evidence that before he pulled the accused Young Person down the stairs, he had witnessed BS punch the accused in the face, and had witnessed the accused swing the Corona beer bottle at BS, missing, and striking the wall with the bottle, which smashed.

23BC and the witness Sally gave evidence that when the accused Young Person stood up, after falling down the stairs, he deliberately stabbed BC in the right shoulder with a broken beer bottle. BC did not witness the actual stabbing, but says when he felt the blow he turned around to see the accused Young Person standing there, with no one else around him. He said there was blood pouring from a cut on his shoulder. Sally says she saw the accused Young Person deliberately stab BC from behind, with the broken bottle, using a downward stabbing motion.

24As is often the case with matters of this nature, there was confusion with inconsistent accounts from those present. This case was no different.

25I am satisfied, however, that the evidence does establish that BC had not consumed any alcohol on this night, and that the witness Sally was not affected by alcohol. I am also satisfied that the evidence does establish that the accused Young Person was well affected by alcohol.

26BC attended the hospital where his wound was treated.

27Police subsequently attended the premises and took statements from potential witnesses.

28BC provided two statements to police, and conceded in cross-examination that he provided no details of some important aspects to police in those statements, including not mentioning seeing the accused Young Person swing the unbroken beer bottle at BS; not mentioning seeing the beer bottle being broken at the top of the stairs when the accused Young Person swung it at BS; not mentioning that the accused swung the broken bottle towards another person (although BC says he did tell the police about this aspect). His statement made some four days after the incident (exhibit 6 - paragraph 8) says ""My back was covered in blood. I don't know when I was cut. I didn't feel it happen. I believe I was cut by Z..."" BC says this was incorrectly recorded by the police when he made his statement.

29BC was an excitable witness. Even though he did not embellish his evidence when it might be expected he could, his evidence in Court was nevertheless at odds with the versions he provided to the police on the night of the incident and again four days later when he provided a second statement. These inconsistencies or omissions would make it difficult to accept his evidence as a reliable version of events.

30Following the arrest of the accused Young Person, he was interviewed by police on the morning following the incident (ERISP transcript, exhibit 3). It is fair to say that the accused could not remember any relevant events from the night before, due to his level of intoxication, although he does make some assumptions. It is my view that some potential admissions are not sufficiently reliable to take into account in these proceedings.

31The witness Sally was in my view an impressive and credible witness. She says she witnessed the accused Young Person stab BC in the shoulder with the broken beer bottle. Her evidence about surrounding events is consistent with the statements made by others at the scene.

32I accept the evidence of the witness Sally, and accordingly I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused Young Person deliberately wounded BC with the broken beer bottle, and I find this charge proved. Having made this finding, it is not necessary to make a finding in relation to the back-up charge.

		03 April 2014",2014-02-10 00:00:00,NSW Children's Court
2705559,R v Deer [2014] NSWDC 24,"REMARKS ON SENTENCE


1I am sentencing a man who as an adult in his twenties persistently engaged in full sexual relations with his teenage niece. She was in her early to mid-teens. The conduct went on for a period of over a year and at one stage the victim became pregnant and terminated the pregnancy. The offending behaviour brought about substantial emotional harm to the victim. 

2I am sentencing the offender for four offences, although the sexual engagement occurred many more times. The reference to the extended number of times is to put the four offences into context. It is important to appreciate that I am sentencing the offender for only four offences.

3The offender's name is Graeme Deer. He has just turned 41. The victim of his crimes is Willow White. She is nine years younger than Mr Deer. Mr Deer is her mother's brother. 

4The details of the offences are set out in what is called the agreed facts. This is part of exhibit A. I take this brief description from those agreed facts.

5Willow White was 11 when she was living in [place] with her mother and two of her five sisters. She spent a lot of time with her maternal uncle, Graeme Deer, and developed a crush on him. Sometime in 1996, after 2 April when Willow White was 14 and Mr Deer was 23, Willow White was left in his care at [place]. Her mother was in [place]. They were in the bedroom on the floor. Mr Deer engaged in sexual intercourse with Willow White.

6Because the definition of sexual intercourse legally is wide I need to explain that on each of the occasions that I refer to it, it is in the usual understanding of sexual intercourse, namely, the insertion of Mr Deer's penis into his victim's vagina.

7On this occasion that I am talking about Mr Deer continued until he ejaculated. He did not use a condom. When he left the room Willow White went into the bathroom and noticed that she was bleeding, she was in pain. She was a virgin before that occasion. 

8The facts record that from that time onwards that Graeme Deer ""continued to have unprotected sexual intercourse with the complainant on a regular basis"". Again, I emphasise that that is for the purposes of putting his offending behaviour into context. It points out that these offences were not isolated incidents; they were part of a pattern of behaviour. I am sentencing Mr Deer, however, I repeat, for only four offences.

9The behaviour I have just described occurred between 2 April and 31 December 1996 at [place] and that constitutes the first offence.

10All of the charges are offences under s 66C(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offence is called sexual intercourse with a child aged between 10 and 16 years under authority. Each of the four offences that I am sentencing Mr Deer for carries a maximum of 10 years imprisonment.

11Mr Deer has pleaded guilty to each of the offences and he has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity. I say that because the law provides that if a person pleads guilty at the earliest available opportunity the sentencing court should discount the sentence which the court would otherwise impose by 25%. In due course I will do that.

12I turn to the second offence which occurred on [date] January 1997. Willow White remembers that because it was Mr Deer's birthday. She was 14. She was on a lounge at home in [place]. Again Mr Deer had full unprotected sex with her until he ejaculated. In July of that year Willow White had turned 15 and she moved in with her sister and her sister's boyfriend and Mr Deer. He was then about 24. The place they moved into was at [place]. 

13The third offence which I am sentencing Mr Deer for occurred sometime between 28 July 1997 and 6 August 1997. Willow White was then 15. She was in her uncle's bedroom on his bed. Again Mr Deer engaged in full sexual intercourse with her until he ejaculated. The same thing occurred sometime between 28 August 1997 and 6 September 1997 at [place]. Willow White was still 15 years old. 

14They are the four offences that Mr Deer has pleaded guilty to and I formally convict him of those four crimes.

15Sometime during August 1997 Willow White suspected she was pregnant and her suspicion proved to be correct. She told Mr Deer. He was not happy. He wanted her to lose the baby and suggested a number of ways to bring about a miscarriage. He told her to jump out of a tree in the backyard and to land on her bottom. She climbed the tree, but could not let go. She was resisting, but he insisted. She fell to the ground and landed on her bottom and winded herself. That apparently did not have the effect which Mr Deer wanted, namely, to cause a miscarriage of the pregnancy. So on 6 September 1997 Willow White went to a doctor's surgery. She was told she was about 18 weeks pregnant. She went to [place] Hospital on 23 September where the pregnancy was terminated. 

16The agreed facts record that Willow White ""had felt constantly pressured by the accused to discontinue the pregnancy and she believed that this was what he wanted."" She did not disclose the identity of the father to any authorities ""as she wanted to protect the accused. She knew he would get into trouble if anyone found out."" 

17Mr Deer continued to engage in sexual intercourse with Willow White until the end of 1997. 

18At some stage, some years later, Willow White went to the police. Evidence was gathered against Mr Deer by way of a listening device. During the recording of conversations between him and Willow White he acknowledged what he had done and was arrested and charged on 8 January 2013. He spent that night in custody.

19Mr Deer has been in custody on other matters since 6 July 2013 and it is agreed between the legal representatives of the prosecution and the defence that the sentence can date from then. In fact I will date the sentence from the day before, 5 July 2013, to take into account the day he spent in custody when he was arrested.

20Mr Deer does have a criminal record. It is not a serious one. He has a series of summary drug offences in 1998 and again in 2011 and there is a traffic offence recorded in 2012. 

21This is a case where the victim of the crime, Willow White, provided a victim impact statement.

HIS HONOUR: I should add at this point in my remarks that the identity of the victim of a sexual assault is protected in New South Wales. That means the name Willow White and any way of linking her to this case as a victim cannot be published outside this courtroom. It is an offence to do it.

Willow White read out her victim impact statement in court before me on 18 December 2013 when Mr Deer's sentencing case came before me in [place]. I recall her reading it out and the note I made at the time is that the victim impact statement was very courageous and articulate.

22A copy of the victim impact statement is contained as part of exhibit A. I do not propose to read it out in full. I am going to make reference to a couple of parts of it. In due course, when these remarks on sentence are published, I am going to direct my associate to scan the victim impact statement and to remove any identifying information and to publish it with my remarks on sentence.   [It now forms an appendix to these Remarks on Sentence]

23Amongst other things Willow White said that the ""abuse has affected my relationship with my long term partner of almost 16 years"". It is apparently ""only recently"" that her partner [name] has come to know of the details of what happened. Ms White feels that ""the abuse has also affected my relationship with my three daughters."" She goes on to say she is overprotective of them and fears for them. She finds it ""hard to trust any men around them"" even her partner ""who I know would never do anything to them. I can't help it."" She thinks that ""this fear is getting worse because my girls are getting older and approaching the age I was when [Graeme] started assaulting me. I find it hard to show emotion, and find it hard to be close to them and to hug them, even to tell them that I love them. I find it hard to have deep and meaningful conversations with them. I find it hard to be close to them as they get older.""

24Willow White acknowledged that she ""had to keep the full disclosure of the sexual assaults bottled up for a very long time."" She describes the ""large amount of anger"" she had inside of her and how it ""can come out in my family and social life. I have lost friendships due to my anger."" The anger leaves her feeling depressed, without an appetite, tired and not enjoying life. She said that she has been diagnosed with major depression and post-traumatic stress disorder and has anxiety. In closing Ms White said this -

""In summary, the abuse stole my innocence and my virginity. It has put me through grief, affected my mental health, and affected my family life. The effects are still ongoing. I feel that I will be impacted for the rest of my life by what happened. I still have traumatic dreams that relate to the termination and traumatic dreams with [Graeme] in them. I have always wanted an acknowledgment from [Graeme] as to what he has done to me. But no apology now will make me feel any different or can change what has happened.""

I repeat this was a very courageous and articulate victim impact statement. 

25There was an issue as to whether I could make a finding in this case under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to the effect that the ""injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial"". That is provided for in cl (g) of s 21A(2). I do make the finding in this case that the offence caused substantial emotional harm to the victim. I have little hesitation in making that finding based upon the matters in the victim impact statement which I have referred to, indeed, based upon the victim impact statement as a whole. In making that finding I bear in mind what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said in R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412 at [26] and King v R [2010] NSWCCA 33 at [35] and [36]. 

26There was another issue as to whether I could find that in accordance with s 21A(2)(l) the ""victim was vulnerable, for example, because the victim was very young"". I do not make that finding, because the age of the victim is an element of the offence in accordance with the concluding paragraph of s 21A(2).

27Turning back to Mr Deer's circumstances, I have referred to his criminal record. In addition there is a pre-sentence report about him prepared by Ari Tan, the Unit Leader at [place] Community Corrections Office. Mr Tan concludes his assessment with this paragraph - 

""Mr [Deer] is a man who has had a traumatic childhood and as an adult, an intermittently traumatic life. At times he has problems with alcohol and other drugs, dysfunctional relationships and mental health issues. He has admitted to having abused alcohol and other drugs at the time of his offending, but to his credit does not suggest these were factors in his offending. What is of significant concern though is his belief that he was encouraged to offend by the victim and that she is somewhat responsible. Such an attitude while not seemingly apparent in his life, since he offended, does need addressing by way of interventions. These are available within custody or within the community.""

28I might add there that Mr P Winch of counsel, who appeared for Mr Deer in the sentence proceedings, pointed out that his client's record did not record any other offences of this kind and suggested that his risk of future offending in this regard was low. That submission is supported by a psychologist, from whose report Mr Tan quoted in his pre-sentence report. The psychologist noted that Mr Deer was ""in the low risk category for future sexual reoffending."" Mr Tan himself, however, assessed Mr Deer ""as a medium risk of re-offending."" I am inclined, on the balance of probabilities, given the psychologist's report and the criminal record of Mr Deer, to accept Mr Winch's submission in that regard.

29Mr Deer's childhood is described in the pre-sentence report and is correctly referred to as dysfunctional. His education and employment have been limited. He has had problems with mental health and alcohol and drugs over the years. The psychologist quoted by Mr Tan said that ""Mr [Deer] has shown complete disregard for his victim's psychological and physical well-being over a period of many years."" In addition Mr Tan himself expressed ""significant concern"" that Mr Deer ""appeared to shift blame onto the victim by stating she encouraged him and led him on."" Mr Tan correctly observed that such statements ""suggest a level of denial and certainly an ignorance of the power imbalance that exists between an adult and a child."" I accept those observations. They do not aggravate the offence, nor are they factors which weigh against Mr Deer. However, in my opinion, they reduce to negligible any benefit that I would give Mr Deer for remorse, apart from taking into account, to some very small extent, the fact that he pleaded guilty.

30The offending behaviour which Mr Deer engaged in with his victim was, in my opinion, objectively very serious. He engaged in full penile/vaginal sexual intercourse. That is a very serious form of sexual intercourse. He did not use any protection thereby exposing his victim to the risk of disease and pregnancy. On one occasion she became pregnant. I need to take into account the impact upon his victim of the fact that she had to terminate that pregnancy.

31There is an additional factor specifically under s 21A. These offences occurred in the victim's home. On the other hand, a crime such as this can be committed against a victim who is as young as 10 or 11 years old. Willow White in this case was 14 to 15 years old, closer to the top age for this kind of offending. That is simply to point out that the offending behaviour, although very serious, is not in the absolute worst category.

32So far as the aggravating behaviour about the kind of sexual intercourse and the lack of use of a condom is concerned, I accept the submission of Ms K Stanley, who appeared in the sentence proceedings for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Mr Deer - I also here accept what Ms Stanley says - does not derive any benefit from the fact that there was a delay between his offending behaviour and his being charged.

33Mr Winch argued that there were special circumstances for adjusting what is the normal relationship between the non-parole period fixed for a sentence and the full period. Normally an offender has to serve 75% of his or her sentence in full-time custody as the non-parole period. In special circumstances that percentage can be reduced. Mr Winch argued that the special circumstances in this case included his client's need for counselling and assistance when he resumes his life in the community. That is consistent with the pre-sentence report. In due course I propose to make a small adjustment to the non-parole period so that it will be less than 75% of the full sentence which I impose on Mr Deer.

34I regard, as I said, each of the offences as very serious. Taking into account the seriousness of those offences and little that can be said by way of mitigation either of the offences or of the offender, and also taking into account the maximum fixed by Parliament, I regard an appropriate sentence for each of the offences as 7 years imprisonment. Because Mr Deer has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity to each of the offences, I propose to discount each of the offences by 25% so that for each of the offences he will receive a sentence of 5 years and 3 months. 

35What I propose to do is to fix one sentence, which I can do. It is called an aggregate sentence and is provided for by s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However, I need to point out that - in accordance with Ms Stanley's submission and acknowledged by Mr Winch - I will partly accumulate the sentences. In other words, instead of imposing the four sentences of 5 years and 3 months all to be served at the same time, I would have accumulated each of those sentences by 1 year. The effect would have been this. For the first offence I would have fixed a penalty of 5 years and 3 months to commence on 5 July 2013 and to expire on 4 October 2018. For the second offence, the sentence of 5 years and 3 months would have commenced on 5 July 2014 and expired on 4 October 2019. For the third offence, the sentence of 5 years and 3 months would have commenced on 5 July 2015 and expired on 4 October 2020. For the fourth offence, the sentence of 5 years and 3 months would have commenced on 5 July 2016 and expired on 4 October 2021. Overall and by my calculations, that would have resulted in a sentence of 8 years and 3 months, commencing 5 July 2013 and expiring on 4 October 2021.

36For a sentence of 8 years and 3 months the non-parole period of 75% would have been a little over 6 years. I propose to reduce that non-parole period, taking into account the special circumstances that I have referred to, to 5 years and 4 months, commencing on 5 July 2013 and expiring on 4 November 2018.

HIS HONOUR: I am going to sentence you now, Mr Deer, if you would stand up please.

37Your overall sentence is 8 years and 3 months. It commenced on 5 July 2013 and will expire on 4 October 2021. The non-parole period that you must serve is 5 years and 4 months. It commenced on 5 July 2013 and will expire on 4 November 2018. The first date upon which you will become eligible for parole is 4 November 2018. Whether or not you get parole on that day will depend upon the Parole Authority.

HIS HONOUR: Have a seat, Mr Deer. Mr Wilson, Ms Stanley, if you would please check - the official, the formal sentence, of course, is 8 years and 3 months with a 5 year and 4 months non-parole period. That's the important calculation to check. But I have given you, as the s 53A requires me to do, an indication of what the individual sentences would have been. So it probably would be prudent to check those calculations as well. Take your time.
STANLEY: Both my friend and I agree with those calculations, your Honour.
HIS HONOUR: Now is there anything else I need to attend to? There are no psychiatric or psychological reports that I would send into custody with Mr Deer?
STANLEY: No.
HIS HONOUR: It was only the pre-sentence report.
STANLEY: There's no s 166 certificate or anything.
HIS HONOUR: There is no s 166 certificate?
STANLEY: There is no s 166 certificate or anything of that nature for your Honour to take into account.
HIS HONOUR: No. Thank you. Does that conclude the proceedings, I think?
STANLEY: Yes, your Honour.

Appendix

Victim Impact Statement of [victim]

My name is [victim]. I confirm I have written this Victim Impact Statement myself.

I don't have a lot of memories of [offender] from early childhood, as I never had much contact with him and he was never a big part of my life. He occasionally visited my family and I felt like he was special. I thought he was a trusted family member and he was my favourite uncle. [Mother] was never there for me emotionally. I found that myself and my two sisters, [name] and [name], seemed to attach ourselves to either an uncle, cousin or someone. For me it happened to be [offender] who is 9 years older than me. I looked up to him as someone I could trust, someone I could talk to, someone who would listen to me, someone I could have fun with, and someone who could make all my bad memories go away. Other adults in my life had failed me; especially [mother] who I feel failed me as a mother. I had never felt important to anyone. Growing up I was a quiet and shy girl. I had low self-esteem and no self confidence. I felt lonely, isolated and different to others. I never had the loving and caring home that I deserved. So when I felt [offender] giving me the attention that I wanted so badly, and making me feel loved, special and important, I was drawn in by that and I held onto that. I was oblivious to the danger of what he was doing to me because I was a child. I thought [offender] was different to the other adults in my life because he made me feel special, even before he touched me.

Year 7 at school was great for me. I got top yearly marks in English and French. Then my education began to suffer. My school report shows that in Year 8 my grades started dropping, with 107 absent days for the year. My focus was no longer on school, but instead it all went on [offender] and thinking about what would make him happy. Even when I was at school I couldn't focus on my school work. I found myself starting to do stuff that was out of character, like jumping out my bedroom window at night to go see [offender]. I started lying, wagging school and running away from home. Anything which meant I got to see him. The attention he gave me was more important to me than schooling at that time. 
[Offender] seemed to understand me and why I was unhappy at home. I had no one else I could turn to. When I left home I moved in with my cousin for a short time. I was excited as I knew it meant I would spend more time with [offender]. When we all moved to [place] to live together, I thought it was the best thing that could have happened. It meant that I got to spend all my time with him, apart from when I had to go to school. But I didn't attend as much as I should have with a documented 26 days absent for semester 2. 

I recall that for several months before I actually fell pregnant, [offender] had spoken to me a number of times about having a baby. I remember him telling me that I had to get a boyfriend first so no one would suspect he would be the father. Not long after my [age] birthday I found out I was pregnant. I felt numb. I was in shock and scared. I never thought I would fall pregnant. At one point I thought it would make [offender] happy, but when I told him he suggested that I try to miscarry the baby and suggested how to do it. I felt terrified, as I knew in my own mind that I didn't have the courage to do what he was asking. But because I knew it was what he wanted and it would make him happy, I agreed. The attempts to miscarry failed.

I ended up going to the Doctor and she organised for me to go to [place] to have a termination. I had to lie about the father's name was because I knew that if I had told the truth [offender] could get in serious trouble, and I believed I would too. The Doctor even talked to me about adoption but I knew it wasn't an option because [offender] had made it clear that he wanted me to have a termination. [offender] made me feel like the pregnancy was my fault and that I had to deal with it all on my own. I had no support and I felt very alone. The night before the procedure (after I had the two tablets inserted which I was told were to kill the baby) the baby was moving a lot, the most I had ever felt it move. I even thought to myself at that moment that even if I wanted to change my mind it was too late. I remember when the doctors and nurses had left the room I burst into tears hugging my tummy. When I woke the next morning there was no movement from the baby. I had it explained to me that once I was put to sleep they would scrape the baby away. I didn't really understand any of it. All I wanted then was to get the termination over and done with. When I woke after it was finished I felt numb and empty. I was 18+ weeks pregnant. I was a young girl, totally alone and very hurt, very angry and with no one to care for me. I shouldn't have had to go through something like a termination at such a young age. After I returned home there seemed to be tension between myself and [offender]. Things had changed and it didn't feel the same anymore. I felt lost.

The affects of the abuse and termination continue, and I still find it very hard to talk about. As an adult, I still get very stressed and really upset when I think about the termination. At the moment I think about it everyday. I think it is a good thing now that I went through with the termination but I have lots of mixed feelings. I can't help but sometimes think that I am a bad person for doing it. I often feel guilty and disgusted, and I have hated myself for having it. Really I only went through with it because of [offender]'s pressure. I am angry at [offender] still for this, and because he made me do it alone and made me think it was all my own fault. I think about the baby girl and think about how old she would be now.

For most of my childhood I would hide my emotions and how I was feeling. I was determined not to show my anger as I kept denying what happened. I was acting like the assaults were not affecting me, when deep down day by day they were damaging me. The abuse became part of how life was. I realise now that I have taken on the guilt, shame and secret for too long. It has affected the important relationships in my life.

The abuse has affected my relationship with my long term partner of almost 16 years, [name]. Upon meeting [name] in [place], I moved in with him within a week because [offender] had kicked me out. I would have been a virgin when I met [name] if [offender] hadn't have assaulted me the way he did. I didn't know what to tell [name] about how I had lost my virginity. I could not to talk to [name] for a long time and it is only recently that he has come to know the details of what happened to me. He finds it hard to deal with. We have found it very hard to talk and communicate. It has put a huge amount of pressure on our relationship. I have been confused about my relationship and my feelings. It affects intimacy. I hate being seen naked by [name] or anyone else. My relationship has suffered because of how I feel. I find it hard to show him affection. I keep stuff to myself and don't talk to him. 

I feel the abuse has also affected my relationship with my three daughters. I am overprotective of them. I fear for them. I find it hard to trust any men around them; even [name] (their father) who I know would never do anything to them. I can't help it. I don't even like [name] to go in the bathroom while they are having a bath. I fear for them even going to friends' houses to play. Anything that happens with my daughters, for example if they don't want to sleep at a friend's place, I think the worst and think that something bad could have happened to them like what happened to me. I think this fear is getting worse because my girls are getting older and approaching the age I was when [offender] started assaulting me. I find it hard to show emotion, and find it hard to be close to them and to hug them, even to tell them I love them. I find it hard to have deep and meaningful conversations with them. I find it hard to be close to them as they get older. 

As an adult I have withdrawn and become distant from the people close to me. I find it very hard to speak to anyone when I have a problem and I still always bottle things up. I felt I had to keep the full disclosure of the sexual assaults bottled up for a very long time, and this enabled him to get away with doing this to me for so long. I now know that what happened isn't my fault, but I still blame myself. I didn't tell anyone because I was scared and felt ashamed, and I was worried what people would think of me. I thought that I would get the blame just as much as [offender]. I wish that I had had the courage to take the step of reporting the abuse sooner, but without the support from my counsellor I would not have been mentally ready. I still feel a lot of anger, and I hate that I had to carry this awful secret for so long. The assaults are something that I have always thought about and have always been on my mind. I hate [offender] for what he has done to me. What happened has changed me and who I am as a person. I feel it has stopped me from being all that I could be. What has happened to me has in a sense ruined my life.

The large amount of anger I have inside me can come out in my family and my social life. I have lost friendships due to my anger. The anger makes me feel depressed, and leaves me not enjoying life, having no appetite, and feeling tired all the time. I can want to cry over nothing, and get angry at the smallest things. I can go from feeling normal to getting angry with in seconds. It also takes me a long time to get over things and to get out of a cranky mood.

I find it very hard to trust people. I am fearful of men and try to avoid being alone with any male. I have low self esteem. I do not look after myself like I used to. When I first met [name], I tried to move on with my life and I used to enjoy doing girly things like getting my nails done and going shopping, but I no longer enjoy doing these things. I have good days and bad days, and I can struggle to get through the day. But I do it for my girls, they need me. I have even had moments where I wish I could just vanish into thin air.

I have been diagnosed with Major Depression and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and I have anxiety. I have lost motivation in life. I feel this is all linked to this abuse. Earlier this year I quit my job of four and a half years because of my mental health. I am currently on medication and have regular counselling to help with this. Going to counselling is helping me to understand. I'm learning to know who I am. I'm working on shifting the self blame. I realise that feeling powerless is a feeling that comes with abuse. I now know it is ok for me to break my silence and to remove the protective shield. I now don't have to worry about others knowing and finding out. I was a child and he was the adult. I was needy and he used my neediness for his pleasure. [Offender] took advantage of me, he stole my innocence, and he took away my right to have a normal adolescence. I was introduced to sex on an adult's level, which means I never had the chance to explore naturally. I couldn't enjoy sharing that journey with my peers. They did not share my experiences. 

In summary, the abuse stole my innocence and my virginity. It has put me through grief, affected my mental health, and affected my family life. The effects are still ongoing. I feel that I will be impacted for the rest of my life by what happened. I still have traumatic dreams that relate to the termination and traumatic dreams with [offender] in them. I have always wanted an acknowledgement from [offender] as to what he has done to me. But no apology now will make me feel any different or can change what has happened.

		01 April 2014",2014-01-23 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705566,State of New South Wales v McQuilton [2014] NSWSC 11,"Judgment
1The Attorney General, on behalf of the State of New South Wales (""the plaintiff""), has applied for a high risk sex offender extended supervision order in respect of Daniel Anthony McQuilton (""the defendant"") pursuant to the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (""the Act"").
2There is no dispute that the defendant is what the Act calls a ""high risk sex offender"".  Having considered the material relied upon by the plaintiff, for the reasons set out below I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the defendant poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision: s 5B(2) of the Act.
3There was also no dispute that an extended supervision order should be made.  There was a dispute about the duration of such an order but ultimately the parties agreed upon that.  There remained a dispute about the conditions to be imposed.
4The making of any extended supervision order imposes significantly upon the liberty of the subject.  For this reason, and notwithstanding the concession, it is necessary to ensure that all of the statutory requirements have been met and the making of an order is justified.
The index offence
5The defendant is not a repeat sex offender; in fact he has only been convicted of one ""serious sex offence"", an offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  His Honour Judge Blackmore SC sentenced him for that offence on 6 March 2009 to imprisonment for 5 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years.  
6That offence occurred on 31 July 2008 in a car park in Albury at about 10pm.  He was 21 years of age at the time and his victim, a stranger to him, was aged 20.  She was returning to her car after attending a dance class when he grabbed her around the face with his fingers in her mouth.  He told her he was not going to hurt her but there was a struggle and he hit her a number of times.  During the course of this he put his hands in her pants and digitally penetrated her vagina. Ultimately, she managed to break free and fled.  She sustained severe bruising over areas of her head and numerous bruises and scratches to most parts of her body.
7The matter received some media publicity.  About a week later the defendant surrendered himself at a police station and admitted the offence.  He told police that he had wanted to physically hurt the victim because he had been ""feeling a bit frustrated with just, just women in particular, just women in general"".  He claimed it was a ""spur of the moment thing"".  The sentencing judge rejected a prosecution submission that the defendant had ""laid in wait for the victim"".  The defendant has subsequently admitted that he had seen the victim about an hour before the offence and made the decision to wait for her to return to her car to perpetrate the offence against her.  Whilst waiting for her, he attempted to talk himself out of committing the offence, recognising that it was ""wrong"", but that his ""want for sex"" was greater and it prevailed.
Completion of sentence and making of interim order
8The defendant was released on parole on 20 July 2012.  His parole was revoked on 11 January 2013 and he was returned to custody the following day.  His sentence expired on 4 November 2013.  On 31 October 2013, Adams J granted the plaintiff's application for an interim supervision order to commence upon the defendant's release.  The conditions of the interim order are the same as those proposed by the plaintiff as being the subject of the final order.  Adams J also appointed two psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the defendant and to furnish reports.  The psychiatrists were Dr Andrew Ellis and Dr Samson Roberts.
Expert assessments of risk of re-offending
9The three primary reports relied upon by the plaintiff concerning the risk of the defendant committing a further serious sex offence are those of Dr Ellis, Dr Roberts and Ms Narcisa Sutton, senior psychologist, Corrective Services NSW.  Ms Sutton's report was prepared to assist on the question whether the current application should be made.  There are other reports within the material tendered by the plaintiff but it is unnecessary to refer to them, particularly given the concession by the defendant.
Dr Andrew Ellis
10Dr Ellis examined the defendant on 8 November 2013.  The history provided by the defendant included additional information about his offence.  It included that he was feeling very depressed at the time.  He was watching between six and eight hours of violent pornography on a daily basis and masturbating to the images.  He woke that day at about 1pm and began watching television.   The thought came into his head to ""go and rape"" somebody. He had this thought in his head in the past.  He had imagined how this might occur, planning the details of an encounter and masturbating to this imagery. His sister used to attend the dance studio near the car park and he had previously thought about this as a location to enact his rape fantasies.  He said that the attack upon the victim was ""nerve wracking"" but exciting. 
11The defendant told Dr Ellis that at age 14 he was spending two hours a day viewing pornography and masturbating.  This escalated over time. The pornography that most fascinated him were images of pain and fear in female victims.  He has been interested in depictions of heterosexual bondage, discipline, sadism, masochism, voyeurism, rape, torture, urination and anal sex.  He has looked at images of bestiality.  He currently masturbates every second day to fantasies of sadism and masochism.
12The defendant said that he had masturbated while fantasising about women he had met in real life, imagining them in situations of bondage and discipline.  He described an escalation in the level of pain and humiliation inflicted in these fantasies.
13He told Dr Ellis that he had tried voyeurism on four or five occasions, describing going to people's houses and looking inside their windows.  He found this to be sexually exciting and later masturbated to the memory of these activities.
14The defendant was in a relationship for three years with his first sexual partner, commencing when they were both 13.  He told Dr Ellis that as the relationship progressed he would often put her down and enjoyed humiliating her.  He suggested that they engage in sadomasochistic sex but she declined.  Normal sexual intercourse with her became dull for him.
15He then had a six-week relationship with a friend of his first girlfriend when he was aged 17.  They engaged in normal sexual activity which he did not enjoy.  Apart from what was described as a ""one night stand"" at the age of 25, he has had no other sexual partners.
16Dr Ellis' diagnosis of ""primary concern"" is Sexual Sadism Disorder.  He also diagnosed Voyeuristic Disorder, Gambling Disorder and Alcohol Use Disorder, the latter currently in remission in a partially controlled environment.
17Dr Ellis also noted ""a constellation of attenuated psychotic (delusion and hallucination like) symptoms"".  He said the defendant ""also presents with attenuated anxiety and depressive symptoms alongside poor interpersonal function"".  Further, he considered ""the prodrome of a psychotic disorder like schizophrenia is highly likely, but must be confirmed after investigations, history from his mother and serial assessments by a psychiatrist"". Other personality dysfunction could be present.
18In a discussion of the assessment of risk of re-offending, the following paragraphs extracted from Dr Ellis' report are significant:
Deviant sexual arousal is consistently identified as the most prominent risk factor for sexual reoffence.  Mr McQuilton's index offence indicates this patter of arousal, as does his report of engaging in voyeurism.  There is a direct nexus between his masturbatory fantasy and criminal action.  His behaviour escalated from fantasy, to planning and mental rehearsal, actual voyeuristic rehearsal to action.  Serious physical coercion was employed.  Antilibidinal medication is the best treatment to address deviant arousal.  Behavioural techniques may reduce deviant arousal, however deviant arousal was not identified as a prominent issue when he underwent psychological treatment, therefore unlikely to have been addressed.
...
A consideration of the type of possible sexual offence should be considered in an estimation of risk.  In the case of Mr McQuilton, given the particular pattern of sexual arousal, the most likely type of victim would be a woman in a situation where they were alone or in a position of vulnerability.  The associated intimidation and loss of a sense of bodily integrity would be of the type where physical and psychological injury are foreseeable.
19Dr Ellis concluded the risk assessment section of this report as follows:
In considering actuarial, structured professional and clinical parameters in the absence of any treatment of supervision, Mr McQuilton would fall into a group of persons with a risk [of] offending that is high, and greater than a theoretical average offender.  Specific treatment and supervision would likely reduce this risk.
Dr Samson Roberts
20Dr Roberts examined the defendant on 20 November 2013.  The defendant told Dr Roberts that the making of an extended supervision order would be ""ridiculous""; although he conceded that there might be some value in supervision over a twelve-month period to assist his reintegration into the community.
21The defendant told Dr Roberts about his experience with rape fantasies.  He said that they were not as prevalent, nor as intense, as they had been previously.  He claimed that he was now able to keep such thoughts in check.  He was asked whether he had other sexual fantasies and he referred to kissing, touching and fondling.  I note the absence of any mention of the types of fantasies he told Dr Ellis about:  sadism, masochism, bondage and discipline. 
22The history provided to Dr Roberts included longstanding depression.  He told the doctor that he felt that it (currently) could be better controlled.  He also spoke of a belief that people were plotting against him or trying to get him locked up and trying to control his mind.
23The defendant recounted his mental state at the time of the index offence.  He felt deeply depressed, paranoid, ""almost psychotic"" and isolated from everyone.  He was short, direct and dismissive of other people; people were potential enemies; and this related to all people, including family, friends and strangers.  Women were not people with personalities, but were seen as physical, sexual creatures.  He acknowledged that he continued to have such thoughts and feelings on occasions but not all the time as used to be the case.
24Thoughts of the potential impact of his conduct on the victim did not occur to him in the period preceding the offence.  Feelings of being lost, empty and frustrated overrode all thoughts that he had of not doing it.  During the assault he had thoughts of stopping but a voice told him, ""You've come this far you've got to keep going and you'll feel better afterwards"".  He said that it was his intention to take the assault further; to engage in sexual intercourse (by which I assume he meant penile/vaginal intercourse).  He claimed, however, that he was not sexually aroused.  Part of his fantasy had been to tie the victim up, but he had not thought the plan through and did not having anything with which to do so.
25The defendant told Dr Roberts that in retrospect he did not feel good thinking about the offence and that he ""should have reached out in other ways""; he should have talked to someone about what he was going through.  
26Dr Roberts concluded that an appropriate diagnosis was Schizophrenia. He noted that the defendant had been prescribed antidepressant medication since 2009 and antipsychotic medication over the past ten months.  However he considered that the latter maybe at a dosage level that was too low and should be reviewed.
27In the section of his report dealing with the assessment of risk of re-offending, Dr Roberts included:
[I]t is considered that his risk of reoffending is lower than the suggested actuarial assessments of risk.  An assessment of his risk which includes consideration of dynamic factors influenced by the presence of what was previously an untreated psychotic illness, would represent an overestimation.
There remains however, the potential for dramatic escalation of risk in the context of non-compliance with medication. ... [I]t is imperative, from a psychiatric perspective, that Mr McQuilton remains compliant with pharmacological treatment and psychiatric follow up indefinitely. Schizophrenia represents a life-long psychiatric illness requiring indefinite pharmacological treatment.
...
Overall, Mr McQuilton represents a moderate risk of recidivism.  If his psychiatric condition were fully treated, his risk would diminish.  Conversely, if his condition deteriorated, his risk could escalate.  Close monitoring and management by mental health services is therefore imperative in the management of his risk.
Ms Narcisa Sutton
28It is unnecessary to make extensive reference to the content of this report as it formed part of the bundle of documentation received and considered by Dr Ellis and Dr Roberts.  It is, however, appropriate to note Ms Sutton's opinion as to the risk of the defendant re-offending.
29Ms Sutton considered that a ""plausible risk scenario would be if he were to return to a similar way of life as he had during his previous supervision period"" (on parole) and if certain matters occurred.  She then listed about a dozen matters, including neglect in complying with his medication regime; lack of structure to his lifestyle such as with employment, recreational and social activities; becoming isolated and rejecting assistance from others; and returning to deviant pornographic material.  She referred to this as ""an acute high risk scenario"".
30Ms Sutton stated that any reoffending would most likely be relatively spontaneous and with the use of force, rather than being preceded by grooming of his victim.  The potential for escalation of physical violence should the victim be unable to escape, particularly if the defendant's mental health deteriorated, could not be discounted.
31It was noted, however, that the defendant had only the one offence in his criminal history and so ""he does not act out on every opportunity these high risk factors are present"". She also noted that when he was on parole, he was in fact exposed to a ""high risk scenario"" and chose to seek help by talking to his psychologist about his violent sexual fantasies.
32Ms Sutton's conclusion as to the risk of re-offending (which includes reference to the outcome of a treatment program the defendant had undertaken in gaol; something I will say more about later) was:
In my opinion, the overall totality of evidence suggests that Mr McQuilton is in the moderate-high risk category of sexual offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders.  There has been no identifiable resolution of the risk factors associated with his index offence, except for the evidence of Mr McQuilton's self-awareness of his negative mood state and elevated risk, and his willingness to seek assistance to avoid reoffending.  Although this was a positive treatment outcome, particularly in terms of community safety, the expectation is that the offender would be able to put in place strategies to avoid entering risk states.  Mr McQuilton failed to implement the self-management strategies identified in treatment, and chose to ignore the reminders and warnings of his support group and treating professional.
Conclusion 
33In summary, the opinions of the three expert describe the defendant's risk of reoffending as moderate (Dr Roberts), moderate-high (Ms Sutton) and high (Dr Ellis).  
34The reasoning and conclusion of Ms Sutton more supports that of Dr Ellis than that of Dr Roberts.  Dr Ellis' diagnoses were similar to those made by Professor David Greenberg in his report of 26 April 2013 to the Parole Authority.
35Both Dr Ellis and Dr Roberts were available for cross-examination at the hearing but counsel for the defendant only sought to question Dr Roberts.  Such cross-examination was concerned with conditions of an order rather than whether an order should be made at all.
36I consider the opinion of Dr Ellis to carry more weight than that of Dr Roberts, and I say that with the utmost respect.  It seems to me that there was a far more detailed history given by the defendant to Dr Ellis.  Absent from that given to Dr Roberts are matters of concern; for example, a greater degree of involvement by the defendant in deviant sexual thoughts and behaviour in the past as well as the present.  His disclosure of his thoughts and motivations attending the index offence were also more detailed and, in some respects, graphic.
37I am satisfied to a high degree of probability that the test in s 5B(2) has been established: that the defendant is a high risk sex offender because he poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision.
Whether to make a high risk sex offender extended supervision order
38The foregoing is a threshold issue.  I turn now to the question of whether a high risk sex offender extended supervision order should be made.  
39In considering this issue it is necessary to have regard to the matters listed in s 9(3) of the Act as well as anything else that is relevant.
40A number of these matters have already received consideration upon my review of the three expert reports.  
41Another factor is the extent to which the defendant can reasonably and practicably be managed in the community.  The plaintiff sought to place a report of that nature before me in the form of an affidavit of Mr Zouhier Abedine who is the Manager of the ""Extended Supervision Order Team"" within Corrective Services NSW.   Counsel for the defendant objected to the reading of this affidavit on the basis that it was served late and well beyond the timetable previously set and he had been denied the opportunity to properly consider it.  Accordingly I will ignore it.
42Treatment or rehabilitation programs in which the defendant has had the opportunity to participate are required to be considered.  I discuss that in the next section of this judgment.
43The level of compliance with supervision obligations in the past must be considered.  This can be stated briefly: the defendant's performance whilst on parole last year culminated with revocation a little under six months after he was released.  A failure to adequately comply with treatment requirements was one of the concerns.
44An offender's criminal history and any relevant remarks of the sentencing judge must be considered.  There is nothing apart from the index offence in the history and there was nothing said by the judge that adds anything of significance in the present context.
45The most significant matter to be considered under the s 9(3) factors is ""the safety of the community"".  I will refer to this shortly.
Past treatment for sexual offending
46The defendant commenced the Custodial Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) program in February 2011.  It has been noted that he was not completely candid about the some of the circumstances attending his offence.  He was not forthcoming about the sadistic nature of his sexual fantasies, the pornographic material he was accessing, and the entrenched and pervasive nature of the problem.  He was suspended from the program in October 2011 because of intimidating and aggressive behaviour towards another participant.
47He re-entered the program in February 2012 but was discharged a short time later. Thereafter he completed the program via participation in ""Custody Maintenance groups"" and individual therapy sessions.  Treatment report notes indicated that at times he failed to implement the strategies he was supposed to have acquired and engaged in ""problematic behaviours"" in the gaol.  
48The defendant's adherence to treatment requirements whilst on parole was inadequate.  He re-engaged with the CUBIT program when he returned to custody to serve the balance of parole.
49Dr Roberts referred to the defendant's participation in CUBIT (and I suspect this relates to 2011-2012):
It is apparent that during his participation in the CUBIT program he made threatening comments, sexually inappropriate comments, experienced sexual fantasies about the therapist, developed misunderstandings with other offenders and engaged in such conduct as to create the impression that he was irrational and experiencing persecutory thoughts.
50Dr Roberts made the comment that the defendant's psychotic symptoms compromised his participation in CUBIT.  The fact remains that the defendant does not have the benefit of successful engagement in the program.  
51The plaintiff initially tendered a report concerning the defendant's renewed involvement with the program after he was returned to custody this year.  It was served late.  Mr Scragg objected to the tender because he had not had the time and opportunity to consider it and confer with Dr Roberts about it.  Ultimately the plaintiff did not press the tender.
Safety of the community
52The safety of the community is the first of the factors listed in s 9(3).  The primary object of the Act is stated in s 3 to be:
[T]o provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of high risk sex offenders and high risk violent offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community.
53Recitation of the facts of the offence, noting the sexually deviant thoughts and behaviours of the defendant as set out earlier (particularly in the history given to Dr Ellis) and having regard to the difficulties inherent with the defendant's mental health and its direct impact upon the risk of re-offending, are sufficient to explain my conclusion that it is highly desirable that the defendant not be permitted to live in the community without supervision for some period of time.
54I propose to make the order sought.
Duration of order
55The plaintiff initially sought an order for a period of five years whilst the defendant suggested that two years was appropriate.  Ultimately there was agreement that the period should be two years six months. 
56I am satisfied that two years six months is an adequate and appropriate term.  If the defendant's progress towards rehabilitation is less than hoped for and the safety of the community is still at some risk towards the end of that period, there remains the option for the plaintiff to make an application for a further order: s 10(3) of the Act.
Conditions of the order
57A schedule to the summons set out the conditions originally sought by the plaintiff.  Following discussions with the defendant's legal representatives during the day of the hearing of the application, there was some modification which was reflected in an amended schedule that was handed up.  There remained a dispute about a number of matters but before turning to them it is appropriate to mention the opinions about conditions expressed in the reports of Dr Ellis and Dr Roberts.
58Dr Ellis spoke in favour of there being conditions relating to:
· Reporting and monitoring obligations;· Stable accommodation, initially in supported accommodation close to treatment providers, such as a COSP in Sydney, and then gradual transition to an environment close to family (if assessed as supportive and stable) and employment;· obtaining stable employment;· psychiatric oversight in terms of refining the diagnosis and prescribing medication;· counselling and treatment to promote abstinence from illicit substances, alcohol and gambling;· monitoring and surveillance, including electronic monitoring which should be flexible and tailored to the degree of rehabilitation progress to maximise the safety of the community; and· controlling the defendant's access to pornographic material.
59Dr Roberts felt that the conditions set out in the schedule to the summons were appropriate.  While he supported there being adequate communication between treating clinicians and the defendant's supervisors, he expressed caution about this not compromising the defendant's ability to openly discuss his symptoms with those who are treating him.  He considered that the defendant may believe that disclosure of certain matters might lead to re-incarceration.
60Dr Roberts made specific comment about electronic monitoring, stating that there was no strong argument either in favour of it or against it.  Abstinence from alcohol consumption was supported, as was control over access to pornography.  
61Mention should also be made to two affidavits the reading of which was objected to by the defendant.  I referred earlier to the affidavit by Mr Abedine, the manager of the Extended Supervision Order Team.  I was told it was ""intended to assist the Court to understand the relevance of certain conditions and risk ... factors associated"".  There was also the affidavit of Ms Vicki McCarthy who has been the defendant's case manager under the interim order.  The objection to each of these was on the basis that they had been served late and counsel had not had sufficient opportunity to consider them and obtain instructions.  Due to that lack of fairness I will uphold the objection in each case.  The effect, however, is that I am denied knowing whether the defendant has, or has not, been compliant with his obligations under the interim order; subject to an aspect I will mention at the end of this judgment.
Electronic monitoring
62The plaintiff proposes a condition that the defendant be subject to electronic monitoring of his movements.  The condition includes provision for flexibility and discretion about this in that it includes the term, ""as may from time to time be directed by the Departmental supervising officer"".  As a practical matter, electronic monitoring has been imposed as part of his supervision under the interim order and it is highly likely to continue for some time after the making of a final order.
63Persuasive arguments were put by counsel for both parties in support of and in opposition to the inclusion of this condition.  In the end I consider the condition to be appropriate.  It will provide a useful tool for the defendant's supervisors to ensure compliance with various other conditions.
64Dr Roberts anticipated that the defendant should be at an optimal level of treatment within about six to nine months.  He also spoke of various ways in which electronic monitoring is intrusive and would negatively impact upon the defendant's level of paranoia.  
65Ideally, provided the defendant is sufficiently compliant with the conditions of the order, electronic monitoring should only be necessary for a small proportion of the period of the order.  It there is any unreasonableness in the length of time over which this monitoring is in place there is the remedy of seeking a variation of the conditions of the order.
Curfew
66The proposed condition concerning a curfew is not mandatory but is subject to the discretion of the supervising officer.  The defendant opposes it because it provides a barrier to re-establishing life in the community.  In my view, stability of lifestyle is a highly desirable goal in reducing the risk of re-offending.  A curfew, at least in the initial phase of the defendant's reintegration into society, would be appropriate.
Leaving the jurisdiction
67Proposed condition 14 would require the defendant not to leave the State of New South Wales without the written permission of the Commissioner of Corrective Services.  The problem is that his family live in the Albury Wodonga region.  The plaintiff proposed undertaking to ask the Commissioner to consider granting permission in advance for the defendant to go Wodonga, Tangambalanga and Barnawartha.
68I suggested whether the proposed condition could be amended to insert an exception that would permit him to travel to those places.  Counsel for the defendant supported the suggestion.  Counsel for the plaintiff did not have instructions.  I propose to make an amendment.
Departmental contact with employers
69Proposed conditions 15 and 16, to which no objection was taken, provides that the defendant not engage in any employment and the like without approval and that he provide information to his supervising officer about such employment.  Objection was taken to proposed condition 17 which, in short, would enable the defendant's supervisor to contact any employer for the purpose of obtaining information relating to the employment.  
70The objection was based upon concern that this condition would be ""a barrier to the defendant obtaining employment and re-establishing himself in the community"".  There was concern that if a departmental officer contacted an employer, he or she would need to know, because of privacy reasons at least, who the inquirer was and the purpose of the inquiry.
71I do not know whether the defendant has up until now been found to be frank and honest with his supervising officer or otherwise.  I consider that condition 17 is necessary to enable proper effect to be given to condition 15 without leaving this aspect solely in the defendant's hands under condition 16.  In this regard I have assumed that any inquiries of an employer would only be made if absolutely essential and with the utmost discretion.
Non-association
72Proposed condition 18 is that ""the defendant must not associate with any persons specified by the Departmental supervising officer"".   The defendant opposed it and argued that there should only be a restriction on associating with sex offenders and the victim of his offence.  Those matters are caught by proposed condition 19 to which no objection was taken.
73Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that this was a useful condition in that it provided the supervising officer with the discretion to prevent the defendant having contact with people who may encourage antisocial behaviour or behaviour that would be contrary to the interests of his rehabilitation and mental health recovery.  I accept that submission.
Disclosure in relation to intimate associations
74This proposed condition would require the defendant to inform his supervising officer if he enters into any sexual or intimate relationship.  It would also permit disclosure to the other person of information about the defendant's offence history ""if the officer is satisfied that to do so is necessary or desirable in the interests of the safety of the other person"".
75This condition was opposed on the basis that it would be a barrier to the defendant initiating a relationship and that his history is something that he should disclose at a time of his choosing.
76The defendant has had a negative attitude to women and his aberrant thoughts, if he gave effect to them, would expose any women to significant risk.  Such attitude and thoughts are said by Dr Roberts to have abated but not entirely.  It would promote the protection of the community to provide for this discretion in the supervising officer.
Place restriction
77Proposed condition 21 is that the supervising officer have a discretion to specify places or districts that the defendant must not frequent or visit.  Counsel for the defendant submitted that if there is any such place or district then it should be specified now.  It was also submitted that any concern of the plaintiff was addressed by proposed condition 3 which required compliance with ""any reasonable direction"" of the supervising officer.
78If the defendant accepts that he can be given directions as to places he should not frequent or visit under condition 3, I can see no reasonable basis for the objection to proposed condition 21.  And it is desirable to spell it out specifically so there can be no misunderstanding.
Restriction of attending licensed clubs
79Proposed condition 25 would require the defendant to have prior approval before attending licensed premises, including hotels, bars, licensed clubs and racecourses.  There was an objection to the inclusion of licensed clubs.  It would impede the defendant's participation in sporting activities which are supported or co-ordinated by such clubs.
80There is a concern about the defendant's involvement with gambling and, to a lesser extent, alcohol.  There should be no bar to his involvement with sporting activities that would involve association with a licensed club but there should be the ability of the supervising officer to exercise some level of control to ensure it is in keeping with his rehabilitation.
Application by plaintiff to reopen in relation to the electronic monitoring condition sought
81The composition of this judgment, including the proposed orders, was completed more than a week before it was to be delivered.  Two days before it was due to be delivered, the plaintiff filed a notice of motion seeking the reopening of its case.  
82Evidence in support of the motion indicated that on 30-31 December 2013 the defendant had breached conditions of the interim supervision order to which he was then subject.  He was required to submit to electronic monitoring but on the afternoon of 30 December had removed the electronic monitoring equipment and left it concealed in vegetation in Hyde Park.  He was found the following morning at about 5.30am on the oval at Cranbrook School, a male only day and boarding high school.  It was later discovered that he was not wearing any underwear.  Near to where he was found on the oval were a pair of men's underwear, a pair of scissors, and an almost empty bottle of bourbon.   
83Conditions of the interim supervision order included that the defendant subject himself to electronic monitoring and not tamper with such equipment; that he not possess or consume alcohol; and that he not carry any weapon.  He had also been given a direction that he comply with a 6.00pm curfew.  
84Police arrested the defendant and charged him with entering inclosed lands and breaching his interim supervision order.  The matter remains pending in the Local Court and he has been refused bail.  It is important to stress that the allegations remain to be proved.
85The issue to which the plaintiff asserted the new evidence was relevant was the dispute about whether there should be a condition concerning electronic monitoring.  The plaintiff was not seeking to add any further conditions or modify its stance as to the term of the extended supervision order it seeks.
86The defendant opposed the application to reopen. Counsel for both parties cited authorities relevant to such an issue. 
87It is unnecessary to discuss the law that is relevant to this; I had already decided that there should be an electronic monitoring condition.  The fresh evidence would add nothing of significance, except perhaps as serving to confirm my resolve in that regard.  For this reason I refused the plaintiff's application.
Orders
88I make the following orders:
1 Pursuant to s 5C and s 9(1)(a) of the Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006 (NSW) (""the Act"") the defendant is subject to a high risk sex offender extended supervision order (""the order"") for a period of two years six months expiring on 23 July 2016.
2 Pursuant to s 11 of the Act the defendant is directed for the period of the order to comply with the conditions set out in the schedule to the order.

		24 January 2014",2014-01-23 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705580,R v Galway [2014] NSWDC 1,"Judgment
1On 18 September 2013 the Accused elected to be tried by judge alone. On 20 September 2013 Blanch J, CJDC directed that the Accused be so tried. On 25 September 2013 the Crown presented to me an amended indictment on which the Accused was arraigned. That indictment contained ten counts, although they were not so numbered. The Accused pleaded ""guilty"" to two counts (those numbered 2 and 3). Those were offences contrary to Firearms Act 1996 s 7(1) (count 2) and to the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 s 7(1) (count 3). To the remaining charges the Accused pleaded ""not guilty"". It has become my responsibility therefore to determine whether the Accused is guilty or not guilty of those charges and of any alternative statutory counts.
The charges
2The charges to which the Accused pleaded ""not guilty"" are these:
Count 1:Between 1 January 2008 and 27 November 2008 at Grose Wold in the State of New South Wales, manufactured a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug and exposed a child, namely Teeka Cole-Galway, to the manufacturing process.
in the alternative,
Count 1A:Between 1 January 2008 and 27 November 2008 at Grose Wold in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug and exposed a child, namely Teeka Cole-Galway, to the manufacturing process.
Count 4:On 27 November 2008 at Grose Wold in the State of New South Wales, had in his possession 79.26 grams of pseudoephedrine, a precursor intended by him for use in the manufacture by him of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine.
Count 5:On 27 November 2008 at Grose Wold, in the State of New South Wales, did supply a prohibited drug, namely ketamine in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
Count 6:Between 1 July 2006 and 26 November 2008 at Leppington, in the State of New South Wales, manufactured a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
in the alternative,
Count 6A:Between 1 July 2006 and 26 November 2008 at Leppington, in the State of New South Wales, did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
Count 7:Between 1 July 2006 and 26 November 2008 at Leppington, in the State of New South Wales, manufactured a prohibited drug, namely 3, 4 methylenedioxymehtylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
in the alternative,
Count 7A:Between 1 July 2006 and 26 November 2008 at Leppington, in the State of New South Wales did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely 3, 4 methylenedioxymehtylamphetamine in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.
Legal directions
3As this is a criminal trial it is important that I direct myself as I would direct a jury if a jury had been empanelled to decide questions of fact. The onus of proof of the guilt of the Accused for each of the charges is placed squarely on the Crown. That burden rests upon the Crown in respect of each element of each offence with which the Accused is charged. The onus of proof never shifts to the Accused. There is no obligation whatsoever on the Accused to prove any fact or issue in dispute. It is not for the Accused to prove his innocence but it is for the Crown to prove his guilt. In this case the Accused gave evidence and called another witness to give evidence on his behalf. The Accused does not have to prove that his version of events is true. Rather, the Crown must satisfy me that the version of events given in the defence case should not be accepted as a version of events that could reasonably be true. 
4The Crown must prove the Accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt. This is the highest standard of proof known to our law. At the end of my consideration of the evidence and of the submissions of counsel I must ask myself whether the Crown has established the Accused's guilt in respect of each offence beyond reasonable doubt. If there be any reasonable possibility that the Accused is not guilty, then he must be acquitted. However, the Crown does not have the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt every single fact that arises from the evidence that is in dispute. The obligation which rests upon the Crown is to prove each element of each charge beyond reasonable doubt. As the Accused has given his version of events and called a witness on one of the issues joined between the Crown and the Accused, the Crown must satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that I ought reject that evidence as a reasonably possible version of the facts. If the evidence given by the Accused and/or that called by him leaves a reasonable doubt as to whether the Crown has made out its case in respect of any element of any offence, then I an bound to return a verdict of ""not guilty"" in respect of that offence or those offences. In other words, I do not have to believe that the Accused and his witness is or are telling the truth before he is entitled to be acquitted. If I find that there is a reasonable possibility that the version presented by the defence is true, then the Crown will have failed in its obligation to persuade me of the Accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, on the appropriate charge or charges.
5The Crown has called the Accused's brother, Daryl Barry John Galway, to give evidence against him. Daryl Galway has been criminally concerned in a number of events giving rise to the present proceedings. On 11 October 2010 he was arraigned on an indictment containing three counts: 
(1) Daryl Barry Galway from about 20 November 2007 to 20 May 2009 at Leppington in the State of New South Wales did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the large commercial quantity for such drug.
(2) Daryl Barry Galway from about 20 November 2007 to 20 May 2009 at Leppington in the State of New South Wales did knowingly take part in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, in an amount not less than the commercial quantity for such drug.
(3) Daryl Barry Galway where Lesley Galway having committed the serious indictable offence of manufacturing a prohibited drug, Daryl Barry Galway between 20 November 2008 and 20 May 2009 at Leppington in the State of New South Wales, knowing that Lesley Galway committed that offence and knowing that he has information which might be of material assistance in securing the prosecution of Lesley Galway for that offence, without reasonable excuse, failed to bring that information to the attention of a member of the Police Force.
Count 1 against Daryl Galway is, but for the particulars as to time, identical with count 6A against the Accused and is based on the same material facts: a clandestine drug laboratory at Leppington discovered by police on 20 May 2009. Daryl Galway pleaded ""not guilty"" to count 1 against him but ""guilty"" to the other two counts. The Crown accepted those pleas of ""guilty"" in full satisfaction of the indictment against him. Daryl Galway assisted the police by giving statements implicating his brother and gave to the relevant authorities an undertaking to give evidence against the Accused. Such assistance was taken into account when Daryl Galway was sentenced on 1 April 2011 by Zahra DCJ (see exhibit U). His Honour allowed Daryl Galway a 15% discount on his sentence because of his undertaking to give evidence against the Accused.
6When evidence is given by a person who has been criminally concerned in the events that give rise to the proceedings, the judge is by law required to warn the tribunal of fact that such evidence may be unreliable. The common law rule applies to accomplices (Davies v DPP [1954] AC 378; [1954] All ER 507; R v Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153) and would apply in this case. Evidence Act 1995, s 165(1)(d) extends the principle to witnesses with an interest to serve, similar to that of an accomplice.  The need to give such a warning arises because the courts have, over the years, accumulated a great deal of experience concerning the reliability of evidence given by a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceedings. That experience has shown that the evidence given by such a witness is often unreliable. However, this is not always the position. Nevertheless, I must approach the evidence of Daryl Galway with considerable caution. 
7Possible reasons for such unreliability are these:
(a)It is only natural that such a witnesses might want to shift blame from himself onto another or others, to either justify his own conduct or to minimise his own conduct. In the process of doing so, the witness might construct untruthful stories, to minimise his own conduct or to maximise that of others, even going so far as to blame a quite innocent person. 
(b)Such a witness might make false claims as to the involvement of another out of motives of revenge or a feeling of dislike or hostility or as ""pay back"" for some earlier, perceived wrong.
(c)Such a witness may be motivated to give false evidence in order to qualify for a reduction in his own sentence, which clearly happened here. If Daryl Galway did not give evidence against the Accused, the law provides a mechanism by which his sentence could be reopened and the benefit of the discount lost.
(d)Experience has shown that once such a witness has given a version of events to the police inculpating the Accused, he might feel locked into that version, even if it contained inaccuracies and/or untruths.
(e)There may be other reasons why such a witness gives false evidence but it is not for the Accused to establish the reason or reasons why the witness in lying. 
When assessing the evidence of Daryl Galway, which I must do later, I must have regard to this accumulation of experience and approach his evidence with the necessary caution.

Brief overview
9These proceedings arise out of the execution by police of two search warrants. The first search warrant was executed on Thursday 27 November 2008 at 74 Scotts Farm Road, Grose Wold (""Grose Wold""). This gave rise to the counts numbered 1 to 5 in the indictment. The second search warrant was executed on Wednesday 20 May 2009 at 151A Dickson Road, Leppington (""Leppington""). This gave rise to the counts numbered 6 to 7A in the indictment.
Background - Grose Wold
10The Accused was born on 11 October 1968 (exhibit T). At the time of the execution of the search warrant he was 40 years old. For a number of years he was in the business of supplying firewood. On 20 June 2002 the Accused commenced a tenancy at 74 Scotts Farm Road, Grose Wold (T 29.36). He initially lived there with his partner Ms Alison Mudford, her daughter Emma and their daughters Madison and Paige (T 327-8). In 2002 the yard where the firewood was stored was at Llandilo. There was an increased demand for firewood in 2003 and, probably in 2004, the Accused and his family moved to the property at Llandilo. The Grose Wold property ""sat dormant for a while"" and was then used by the Accused and his family as a weekender and for ""time out"". In late 2006 or early 2007, the Accused and his family moved back to Grose Wold. For about 12 months before the Accused moved back, the property was occupied by a friend of the Accused, and his wife (T330). There is no suggestion that at any time during 2008 Ms Mudford and her daughters were living at Grose Wold. The inference to be drawn from the evidence of the Accused is that he and Ms Mudford separated in 2007, her taking her daughters with her. The Crown case is that, in early 2008, the Accused's daughter Teeka Cole-Galway (the fruit of an earlier relationship of the Accused with Ms Christine Cole), who was 13 years old at the time of the execution of the search warrant, commenced to reside at Grose Wold with the Accused. An agreed fact (exhibit D, par 2) admits as much but it is very much in issue as to whether she so resided at the relevant time (which itself is very much in issue).
11Grose Wold is a three acre property (T330.03). It was rented by the Accused for $350 per week (exhibit D par 2). Access to the property is from the east. There is a front paddock with a rural wire fence on the eastern boundary. On the western side of the front paddock is a white, wooden picket fence behind which stands the house, which faces east. There is a front balcony. The front door gives access to the lounge which occupies the north east corner of the house. West of the lounge are a dining area (in the north-west corner) and below that (i.e. to its south) is the kitchen. There is no laundry room as such but the laundry appliances are in a recess on the southern side of the kitchen, and could be, I infer, covered by doors. The southern half of the house contains four bedrooms and a bathroom, access to which is gained by an ""L"" shaped corridor, leading from the lounge. Bedroom 1 on the western side of the house was occupied by the Accused and bedroom 4, fronting onto the front balcony, was Teeka's room. The rear (western) door of the house opened its backyard from the kitchen. It is to be noted from the sketch plan (as the Accused said in evidence) that from the front door one can see into the kitchen and see at least part of the kitchen bench. However, one would not see from the front door anything that had been moved onto the dining area floor.
12Behind the house, in the north-western corner of the backyard is a shed. Attached to the eastern side of the shed is a structure identified as the ""annexe"". South of the shed was placed a shipping container, which is of no relevance in these proceedings, other than to identify where certain items were found. The Accused could be described as a collector or hoarder or, to use an Americanism, as a ""picker"". This evidence was elicited by Mr Wendeler, for the Accused, in cross-examination of the Officer in Charge, Detective Senior Constable Reay: 
Q. Now the property at Grose Wold you described as being in a rural setting and on acreage. Is it fair to say that when you arrived there you were confronted by a scene which could be described as a riot of junk strewn all about the property?A.  Mr Galway does like to collect items, such as vehicles, yes.
Q.  There were obviously used cars everywhere, is that right?A.  Yes.
Q.  I think you identified a shipping container or more than one.A.  Yes.
Q.  Lots of refuse.A.  Yes.
Q.  In fact there was junk just strewed all about and adjacent to the house.A.  I don't know if you would refer to it as junk but there were a lot of items around the house.
Q. Well if we go to exhibit A, and have a look at some of the photographs that were taken, exhibit A of the condition of circumstances pertaining to the area surrounding the house.  Can I just invite you to photo 7 of exhibit A, the Grose Wold property.A.  Yes.
Q. We'll start with photo 6 actually, it might be a better photo. We can see a view of the residence a view of the driveway and left and right of that driveway there appears to be all sorts of a jumble and riot of all sorts of things alongside the driveway.A. There's a lot of items there but I'd say that they're generally items of value.
Q.  If you go to photo 7.
HIS HONOUR:  Excuse me.  The transcript should record that Mr Wendler is cross-examining the witness upon the photos under tab 1 concerning the Grose Wold property.
WENDLER:  Yes, thank you.
Q. Photo number 7, is that a photograph where we can see at the end of the photograph a number of cars and tyres and chattels piled up.  Do you see that?A. I see tyres, a lawn mower, a number of cars in the rear of the photograph, a gas bottle to the right, there's some items, a motor cycle, a quad-bike and some other items that I can't really make out there.
Q. In photograph number 8 more cars adjacent to the home.A.  Yes.
Q.  And photograph number 9.A.  Yes.
Q. Which appears to be taken looking down the driveway, in other words, in the opposite direction to the photograph in number 7.A. Yeah, from the rear of the property looking back towards the rear of the house.
Q. When you entered the actual inside of the home it was, to put it politely, in an untidy state, wasn't it?A. Yeah, in my opinion it was untidy, I've seen worse.
HIS HONOUR
Q.  With the utmost respect I would have called it a housewives' nightmare.A.  Yes, your Honour, my wife wouldn't be happy with it.
WENDLER
Q. When you interviewed Mr Hart do you remember interviewing Mr Hart?A.  I do.
Q.  Do you remember his description of the inside of the home?A.  Yes.
Q.  He called it a pigsty, didn't he?A.  He did.
The photographs in exhibit A of the Grose Wold property show the Accused's eclectic collection both inside and outside of his house. 
Execution of the search warrant at Grose Wold
13Shortly before 7am of Thursday 27 November 2008, police from the Windsor Local Area Command executed a search warrant at Grose Wold. There were six detectives, two uniformed officers, dog handling officers and Inspector Pinchot as the independent officer. The Accused and Ms Lisa Bullock were found in bed in the main bedroom. Both were arrested, cautioned and immediately conveyed to the Windsor Police Station. The Accused was to remain in custody until posting bail on, probably, 11 May 2009 when he was released from Parklea Correctional Centre. After being interviewed, Ms Bullock was released without charge.
14The police discovered what they described as a clandestine drug laboratory. There is evidence that both the kitchen in the house and the shed were being used, or had been used, for that purpose. DSC Reay briefly entered the shed. He saw items consistent with its being used as a clandestine laboratory and experienced ""an acid chemical, acrid type of smell"" (T03.40). Then DSC Clarke described the same odour as ""a strong chemical smell, like a solvent smell."" A fan was blowing air over a pyrex measuring jug which was placed on a gas burner. The gas burner was later numbered G41. In the items discovered in this area of the shed were two pyrex measuring jugs (G02 mistakenly labelled ""1 Litre pyrex dish"") and a 500 millilitre pyrex measuring jug (G24). The former contained ""an amount of brown liquid"" and the latter ""an amount of off-white liquid."" It is clear from general photograph 25 of the property and ""exhibits in situ"" that the jug on the burner, over which the fan was blowing, contained a brown liquid: hence it was jug G02. Analysis of that liquid states that it contained ""3.61% pseudoephedrine, an estimated 3.11% ketamine and an estimated 0.72% ephedrine. It also contain[ed] chlorpheniramine."" Significantly it contained no trace of MA. On the hotplate of the kitchen was found a pyrex pie dish (A19) containing ""a quantity of clear/beige coloured liquid"". That liquid was later analysed and contained ""27.9% pseudoephedrine"" and chlorpheniramine. 
15Police from the Chemical Operations Unit of the Drug Squad and forensic chemists were then called in. The inference which I drew from the evidence is that police operations ceased until their arrival. The following processes then occurred:
(a)A safety inspection carried out by an officer from the Chemical Operations Unit and an officer from Hazmat.
(b)A site inspection by an officer or officers from the Chemical Operations Unit and a forensic chemist, which was recorded on video film (for the Grose Wold property it is exhibit B).
Both these processes were carried out by officers wearing full body protection suits and breathing apparatus. It was to ensure that it made ""it safe for ordinary police to conduct a normal search"" (T06.18). Police referred to the places in which the laboratory was found as ""hot zones"". 
(c)Letters were then ascribed to various areas in the hot zones.
(d)Police from the Chemical Operations Unit then collected items from each hot zone and took them back to a processing area (""warm zone"") where they were labelled with the letter of the area from where they had been moved and a number.
(e)Each item was then photographed.
(f)Samples were then taken of any liquids by a forensic chemist using a pipette and of any solid using a spatula. If no liquid could be obtained or solid could be obtained from e.g. glassware found at the site or some electrical apparatus, a solvent (methanol) was used to obtain any residues from glassware or an alcohol swab was used to obtain any residue that could be collected. From most of the items so listed two samples were taken, an ""A"" and a ""B"" sample - the latter clearly to be used as a control sample. Liquids were ""homogenised"" by shaking or stirring prior to sampling so that the sample was representative. The samples were placed in glass vials which had caps as lids, very similar to the tubes used to collect blood. 
(g)The forensic chemists also sought to determine the weight and/or volume of any solids or liquids.
(h)Each item was recorded in an ""Exhibit Log"". That, for Grose Wold, is exhibit L.
(i)Most of the items so identified were destined to go to NSW Waste, but some items were handed to the case officer, DSC Andrew Mackay.
16The areas into which the Grose Wold property was divided are these. The bracketed numbers on the right side of this table are the number of items identified by the police.
A:Kitchen and laundry of the house(63)B:Dining area of the house(19)C:Area outside the back door of the house(8)D:Dirt floor of the shed(41)E:North side of the shed (on benches etc.)(23)F:West side of the shed (on benches etc.)(23)G:South side of the shed (on benches etc.)(65)H:Refrigerator on south side of the shed(13)I:Area immediately north of the shipping container (14)J:White Commodore at rear of the house(1)K:Between the shipping container and the house (middle of the backyard.)(1)L:Grass on a fence line at the rear of the property(4)M:Another vehicle at the rear of the property(1)
Excluding items I06 (a rifle scope and firearms ammunition) and J01 (firearm parts), police identified 274 items. The forensic chemists collected 156 primary (A) samples. The forensic chemists involved in those processes at Grose Wold were Ms Allayna Edgar and Ms Erin Ellis (on both 27 and 28 November 2008) and Mr Peter Ballard from 2pm on 28 November 2008. Ms Ellis gave this evidence in re-examination as to the process in determining what to sample:
Q. Ms Ellis, in relation to those items from which samples were not taken you've been asked questions by me and in cross-examination about that.  Can you tell us, please, based on your recollection and to the extent that your notes assist and based on your training and experience, in respect of Grose Wold what factors informed the decision whether or not to take a sample from items that you examined?A. Yep, for Grose Wold as there were a number items at the premise we took washes and swabs of items of importance such as scientific glassware or items that we believed could have been used in the manufacture process.  Items such as glass jars that contained just residues of liquids that may have been in there weren't tested, they only contained a small amount so we took samples from items that contained large amounts of liquids and there were a large number of those. We collected filter papers, not all of the filter papers.  As we've seen from the exhibit log there were a number of items containing filter papers so we collected what we believed was a representative sample of each of the types of items that we observed at the residence.
Q.  So it was an informed process rather than a random selection of items?A.  Very much so.
In addition it should be noted that some items were inappropriate for testing e.g. some electrical items.
Chemical analysis
17All the chemical samples obtained by the forensic chemists were taken to the police laboratory at Pemulwuy, where a preliminary analysis was made. Eight of the sample vials were damaged in transit (D06, D14, D16, D25, D27, E11, F03, G04) and no analysis could be made of them. The defence challenged the evidence of Ms Ellis as to the continuity of the chemical exhibits, their security before removal from Grose Wold and as to contamination of other chemical exhibits by the leaking of fluids from the damaged vials. However, having carefully considered her evidence, I am confident that the chemical exhibits, i.e. the samples, were safeguarded at Grose Wold, were properly transported to the laboratory at Pemulwuy and that the damage to the eight vials I have just mentioned led to no contamination of the other samples. After the preliminary sampling at Pemulwuy, 59 samples were sent to NMI at Pymble. 
18Ms Ellis made a chart of the items that were not listed (exhibits O and O1). It lists 112 items. However, 156 plus 112 makes a total of 268, which is 6 less than the 274 items referred to in [16] above. This discrepancy has not been explained. Of the items listed in exhibit O, 16 were handed to the case officer (leaving aside I06 and J01). Of those 16 items, 11 went to DAL for analysis. However there are DAL certificates for 25 items. I list below the dates of the DAL certificates for the items analysed, giving the Chemical Operations ""exhibit"" number:
4 February 2009:D04, A08, A61, H11, G10, H10, B1725 February 2009:A47, A48, A55, A52, A5427 February 2009:B13, B08, A20, A4325 March 2009:Nine items without any number, but two of which were taken from the Accused's bedroom (a bag and a box of proprietary medicines each containing pseudoephedrine)
Of the above listed items A08, A61, G10, A20 and A43 were not handed to the case officer but were sampled by the forensic chemists. Why those samples went to DAL rather than NMI has not been explained. Each of the 7 items in the certificate of 25 March 2009 not taken from the Accused's bedroom were taken from the kitchen. Why they were not recorded in the ""exhibit log"" (exhibit L) has not been explained but it is clear from what the photographs show that they were taken on 27 November 2008 by police present at the execution of the search warrant. I mention these things because they create judicial angst and waste time, checking to make sure that something has not been overlooked. 
19The results of the chemical analysis of items numbered between A02 and K01 are tabulated in Appendix A to the report of Mr Peter Ballard of 10 January 2012 which is part of exhibit N. Before outlining the Crown case, it is necessary to consider the process of the manufacture of MA.
The manufacture of MA
20There are a number of steps that are taken to manufacture MA. These steps assume that the manufacturer does not have available pure pseudoephedrine. The first step is the extraction of pseudoephedrine from a proprietary medicine such as Sudafed, Demazin or Codral. Pseudoephedrine is the most common precursor chemical used to manufacture MA because the structure of the molecule of pseudoephedrine is very similar to that of MA. The proprietary medicine contains a proportion of pseudoephedrine and may also contain an anti-histamine such as chlorpheniramine and/or an analgesic. They also contain fillers and binders. The proprietary tablets are firstly pulverised using either a mortar and pestle or blender or coffee grinder or spice grinder. Methylated spirits (ethanol) is added to the powder. The pseudoephedrine dissolves in the methylated spirits, as does the chlorpheniramine. The binders, fillers and other items in the powder are insoluble in methylated spirits. One ends up with a two-layered mixture, pseudoephedrine (and chlorpheniramine) dissolved in the methylated spirits as a top layer and underneath a ""sludgy  layer"" containing the insolubles. The two layers then need to be separated. That can be done by decanting the top layer into another vessel or by using a filtering device, the insolubles being trapped in the filter. Filtration maximises the amount of solvent recovered. 
21The second step is to drive off the methylated spirits, to evaporate the solvent. Mr Ballard gave this evidence: 
A. Basically it's a matter of evaporating the solvents. Typically methylated spirits. That can be done in a number of ways. It could simply be just left there to air dry or placed out in the sun, but that can take a reasonable amount of time. To speed up the process the typical way of obtaining the pseudoephedrine is to heat the mixture. So that solvent can be placed into some sort of vessel which can then be heated. Pyrex dishes are quite often used  like a Pyrex type baking dish. The liquid placed in that dish or other vessel and either placed in a microwave oven and heated for a period of time in the microwave oven to evaporate the solvent or often just placed on some sort of heating element on a stove top, or a separate heating element.
Q. When the evaporation process is complete, what is left?A. What's left is well, it depends on the tablets that were used to start with.  If they were what we call single entity pseudoephedrine tablets that contain only pseudoephedrine and the binders, then you would be left with reasonable pure pseudoephedrine, or at least a fairly high percentage of pseudoephedrine.  If it contains other things like the antihistamines then it will contain the pseudoephedrine plus antihistamines..........
HIS HONOUR
Q. Then in what state would it be powder, crystals?A. It's generally a solid.  It can be, I mean, if, if it's being stirred or scraped with a spatula as it's evaporating it can break it up. If it's just left there to evaporate there will be a solid layer on the bottom of the Pyrex dish or whatever other vessel is used.
The purity of the pseudoephedrine thus recovered may be anywhere between 50% and 80%, but about 70% can be expected. 
22The third step is the chemical reaction or ""reflux"" of pseudoephedrine and iodine and hypophosphorous acid. These chemicals are mixed in the ratio of 1:1:1 although Mr Ballard had also heard of the ratio 2:3:3 (T200). Earlier, Mr Ballard had given this evidence:
""[G]enerally after a short period of time a spontaneous reaction will occur and the three components will start reacting and the pseudoephedrine will start the process of converting to methylamphetamine. Typically after a short period of sort of self initiated reaction the vessel which the mixture is in is placed on some sort of heating element and heat is applied to it and that's continued for a period of time with the mixture which is a liquid, sort of just boiling slightly, just a slow boil. And that process continues the reaction and converts and pseudoephedrine to methylamphetamine.""
This reaction takes place in a vessel. Generally, scientific reaction flasks are used for this purpose. Those flasks come in various sizes. A condenser can be used in this step. Mr Ballard explained its use at this stage of the process thus:
A. That item is a condenser. It is used to condense vapours that come out of the reaction flask. It's used in scientific processes and attached to a reaction flask either in a vertical position in the top of the flask when a reflux is being carried out. So when the reaction mixture is boiling the condenser sits on top of the flask in a vertical position; vapours that come off like steam when you boil a jug, those vapours go into the condenser; there's a water jacket in the condenser which is fed water via those tubes that you can see connected to it, and they cool the vapours; condense them back to a liquid, and they drip back down the tube and into the flask, so you have the control of boil where there's no pressure build up because the top of the condenser is open but it's   it makes it somewhat of a closed system where vapours that are produced will condense and fall back in so the liquid doesn't boil dry in a short period of time.
HIS HONOUR
Q.  And you don't lose product?A.  That's right.  
23The fourth step was described as the ""distillation stage"". Caustic soda is added to the mixture to make it alkaline, after the mixture has cooled. In the alkaline mixture, MA will separate and form an oily layer on top. Beneath that layer will be ""generally [an] orange or brown reaction mixture ... which is strongly alkaline"". It is in fact a waste product which needs to be drawn off. That can be done by using a separating funnel and when the MA oil (also called MA base) reaches the tap of the funnel, the tap is closed, thus isolating the MA oil. An alternative method is the use of a condenser. Mr Ballard said this: 
""The other way a condenser can be used is in the distillation process which, after you've manufactured your methylamphetamine, added caustic soda to make it alkaline, and separate the methylamphetamine oil, then that mixture can be distilled, either just directly distilled or by another process known as steam distillation, where steam is purged through the mixture and the condenser is attached to the flask via either a distillation head or something else known as a splash head or even just a glass elbow or a bent piece of tubing, which will have the condenser pointing slightly down and away from the reaction flask and that will cause any vapours that are produced at that stage to go through the bend, into the condenser, condense and then the liquid product drips out the end of the condenser into whatever collection vessel you have available.""
The advantage of the use of steam distillation is that it purifies the MA oil as well (T196.40).
24The fifth step Mr Ballard described as the ""salting-out process."" Typically, MA oil is dissolved in a solvent such as acetone. Hydrochloric acid is then added and the MA will react with the acid to form MA-hydrochloride which is insoluble in acetone and precipitates out and falls to the bottom of the vessel as a fine, crystalline powder. A pH meter or pH strips may be used at this stage. Mr Ballard said this:
""As the hydrochloric acid is added to the mixture of acetone and methylamphetamine base, the pH can be monitored and you're dripping the hydrochloric acid into the mixture and it's binding to the methylamphetamine, then the pH should pretty much stay the same.  When all of the methylamphetamine has been bound to the hydrochloride then any excess acid which is added will start to make the solution acidic and you know, at that stage, by monitoring with a pH strip or pH meter, that the salting out process has been completed.""
Later he said:
""[T]he hydrochloric acid is then added in small quantities, I've seen it added using disposable plastic syringes of various sizes, added to the acetone-methylamphetamine mixture and as I described it can be monitored with a pH meter or pH strips until the liquid starts to turn acidic or pH less than 7 and that indicates that all of the methylamphetamine oil has been reacted with the hydrochloric acid.""
Finally, the MA-hydrochloride powder is separated from the acetone by filtering (T202.38).
25Unless it be found in situ, the way to determine how much MA has been manufactured is to measure the waste product. If one mixes 100 grams of pseudoephedrine with 100 grams of iodine and 100 grams of hypophosphorous acid one expects to obtain 76 grams of MA-hydrochloride. The waste from the initial 300 grams would be 224 grams but the waste is greater if steam distillation be used. Mr Ballard was aware of a report of the Australian Crime Commission on clandestine laboratories which states that for every kilogram of pure MA produced, up to 10 kilograms of hazardous and toxic waste is created. However he did not know the source of that statement, its veracity or scientific basis. On that concession and bearing in mind that this is a criminal trial I am unable to accept a ratio of 1:10. Mr Ballard went on to say that in the scientific community ""an extremely conservative"" ratio in drug manufacture was 1 part drug : 100 parts waste. I base my deliberations on that ratio. 
26When MA is manufactured using pseudoephedrine, the form d-MA is made. The waste product will often contain un-reacted pseudoephedrine because of an imbalance in the proportions of the three chemicals used in the reflux or because the reflux was not carried on long enough (T198.35). If there were an anti-histamine in the original proprietary tablet it will be present in the waste, as will traces of d-MA. The waste is typically ""a dark brown substance"" (T199.27).
The expert evidence
27Expert evidence was given in this trial by Mr Peter Ballard. It ought to be obvious from what I have said about the manufacture of MA that I have based my findings on his evidence. In his report of 10 January 2012 (part of exhibit N), he states his qualifications thus:
Qualification:Bachelor of Applied Science (Applied Chemistry) from University of Western Sydney.
Other Study/Experience:I have over twenty (20) years experience as an analytical chemist, including fourteen (14) years in the analysis of illicit drugs and related substances.
This experience has been gained whilst working at the NSW Division of Analytical Laboratories (DAL), the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories (AGAL)/National Measurement Institute (NMI) and the NSW Police Force Forensic Services Group (NSWPF FSG). I have analysed many samples and I have seen the results of analysis of many samples examined by other analysts.
For more than twelve years my duties have included attendance at premises where manufacture of illicit drugs is suspected. Such sites are commonly called ""clandestine laboratories"" or ""clan labs"". I have attended numerous sites within New South Wales where there was evidence of processes used in the manufacture of restricted substances. During my employment at the AGAL/NMI I carried out analysis of many items seized in relation to ""clan labs"". 
I have attended state and national training courses related to attendance and processing of clandestine drug laboratories and chemical, biological and radiological (CBR) crime scenes. I have completed the NSW Police Force Bomb Scene Examination Workshop and received training within NSW and interstate on the analysis of explosives and explosive residues. I have also developed protocols for the field sampling and laboratory analysis of unknown and hazardous chemicals. 
I have discussed aspects of illicit drugs, explosives and CBR agents with scientific colleagues and law enforcement personnel, both in Australia and overseas. I am the NSW representative for the national Chemical Warfare Agent Laboratory Network (CWALN). I have attended conferences and workshops relating to drug analysis and manufacture both in Australia and overseas. 
In the course of my duties I have carried out extensive reading regarding drugs, explosives and CBR agents in relation to analysis, production methods and use. My reading includes scientific publications, periodicals circulated between forensic laboratories, police intelligence information and 'underground' publications. 
I have given evidence at legal proceedings on numerous occasions. This has been at the levels of Local and District Court, for evidence of both fact and expert opinion. As well as NSW courts, I have given such evidence for courts of law in Queensland, Northern Territory, Western Australia and Victoria. 
At the time of giving evidence, because of a government reorganisation transferring forensic services from NSW Police, he was employed by NSW Health Forensic and Analytical Science Service, but was still working as a forensic chemist. I was greatly assisted by his evidence and have no hesitation in accepting his expert evidence. The defence qualified an expert witness from Queensland, Mr Robertson, but he was not called to give evidence as Mr Ballard conceded in cross-examination all that the defence sought from him. 
The Crown Case - Grose Wold - MA 
28The essence of the Crown case concerning the charges alleged at Grose Wold is that all the drugs, drug ingredients, manufacturing equipment and drug waste found at Grose Wold were used for or resulted from the manufacture of MA at that site. That is pithily summed up by this evidence given by Mr Ballard:
Q. Are you able to say whether there was present at the Grose Wold premises all the items of scientific apparatus, whether modified or purpose built, and equipment to enable the manufacture of methylamphetamine to take place at that time?A. Yes, there was.
Q. So from the pseudoephedrine extraction process through the reflux distillation and resulting in the methylamphetamine hydrochloride?A. Yes.
Q. My question was directed to equipment?A. The equipment, yes, there was.
Q. Were you able to form an opinion upon your examination of the precursors and chemicals and substances and products located whether there was, present at Grose Wold, all the raw materials, if we can call them that, to enable the manufacture of methylamphetamine to take place on the property?A. Yes, there was.  There was the tablets, pseudoephedrine containing tablets, methylated spirits there for the extraction. Then for the next step there was the extracted pseudoephedrine, hydrophosphorous acid and iodine. There was also caustic soda and hydrochloric acid and acetone.
From his report of 10 January 2012, the following ought be noted:
(a) Par 12 points out that pseudoephedrine was found present in items A09, A10, A11, A12, A19, A20, A57, B05, B07, B15, B18, D35, D37, E01, E03, E07, E12, E13, E16, E20, E23, F16, G01, G02, G08, G09, G15, G28, G30, G31, G32, G32, G33, G34, G59, H04, I02, I14 and K01. Many of those items also contained chlorpheniramine. 
(b)Par 14, as explained in oral evidence (T234.75), states that there were factory-labelled containers which had initially contained 88 litres of methylated spirits.
(c) Par 15 points out that quantities of iodine (items G29 and G53) and hydrophosphorous acid (items C03 and G58) were found.
(d) Par 15, with a concession made by Mr Ballard at T238.23, points out that in items A12, B07, B18, D35, E01, E03, E16, E23, F16, G28, G30, G32, G33, G34, H04, I02 and K01 pseudoephedrine was identified in combination with traces of MA, the pseudoephedrine being un-reacted in the manufacture of MA from, clearly, larger amounts of pseudoephedrine.
(e) Par16: 
""The methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine was present in low or trace quantities in the items listed in paragraph 15. These items total in excess of 200 litres of liquid containing methylamphetamine and pseudoephedrine. In my opinion, these items are the waste product from the manufacture of greater than a large commercial quantity (>1 kilogram) of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine.""
Applying the 1:100 ratio, one assumes that the waste liquid had the same density as water, in excess of 200 litres of waste indicates 2 kilograms plus of MA. Whilst the waste liquid would be denser than water, one can easily accept that at least 1 kilogram of MA was the result of such waste. 
(f) Par 19 lists scientific glassware found at Grose Wold which is commonly used in the manufacture of MA.
(g) Par 21 lists other equipment commonly used in the manufacture of MA.
(h) Par 22: 
""The manufacture of methylamphetamine is usually carried out within reaction flasks. Paragraph 19 lists reaction flasks of 3 litre and 5 litre capacities which were seized by police. The generation of more than 200 litres of liquid methylamphetamine waste using a 5 litre reaction flask equates to more than 40 instances of methylamphetamine manufacture. The use of a 3 litre reaction flask equates to more than 66 instances of methylamphetamine manufacture. In my opinion, this equates to the manufacture of greater than a large commercial quantity (>1 kilogram) of methylamphetamine from pseudoephedrine.""
The Crown case - Grose Wold - ketamine 
29Item D04 is described in the ""exhibit log"" (exhibit L) as a ""brown cardboard box with yellow 'DHL' tape containing a plastic bag containing an amount of brown powder."" This has been analysed as 1,718 grams of ketamine with a purity of less than 1%. Mr Ballard gave this evidence about this drug:
""Ketamine is a substance which is used, I believe it's used in veterinary clinics as an anaesthetic for animals but it's also been used around the world as an anaesthetic for humans. It is a substance that I know has been abused and one of the street names of it is Special K and a number of years ago, not for, not for probably ten years or so now, but a number of years ago I was aware that there were a number of seizures or quite a few seizures of methylamphetamine which had been adulterated with ketamine.""
In cross-examination, Mr Ballard agreed that as ketamine is used as an anaesthetic it could be regarded as a tranquiliser, the opposite to a stimulant which is what MA is. He then gave this evidence:
Q. It wouldn't make sense, would it, in your experience, to mix ketamine with amphetamine, would it?A. My understanding is, again from reading and discussions with colleagues, that ketamine in some doses has an hallucinogenic type effect and I think I stated yesterday that ten years ago or so there were quite a number of substances which were being analysed by the laboratory that contained methylamphetamine and ketamine and from memory some of those were - or many of those were in tablet form which were being passed off as I guess fake ecstasy tablets. So I have seen it, not for quite some time, but I have seen it on numerous occasions where methylamphetamine has been mixed with ketamine.
Q. Generally speaking wouldn't you agree that it wouldn't make sense to mix a tranquiliser with a stimulant?A. Well I can't really speak for the synergistic effect of the two combined.
30From Appendix A to Mr Ballard's report of 10 January 2012 it can be seen that ketamine was found in E07, G02, G08, G16, G25, G34, G35, G39, G40, I02 and I14. It is found in combination with pseudoephedrine in E07, G02, G08, G35 and I14. In I02 it is found in combination with traces of d-MA and pseudoephedrine. G34 is a ""Cornwall's Malt Vinegar"" bottle containing 309 grams of brown waste liquid containing 1.39% pseudoephedrine, 0.07% d-MA, an estimated 0.02% MDMA and traces of ketamine. I observe at this stage that there is no allegation of, and no evidence to support, the manufacture of MDMA at Grose Wold. This suggests that this item may have come from elsewhere, which is part of the defence case. In addition, a small plastic bag containing 0.27 grams of ketamine was found on the kitchen windowsill (one of seven items not identified in the ""exhibit log"" or assigned a chemical operations exhibit number). Item B13, a one litre pyrex measuring jug with a teaspoon in it, found on the dining area floor, contained 4.99 grams of ketamine. Item A43 is a Glad snap-lock bag containing 1.23 grams of ketamine, found on the kitchen bench. The last three items strongly suggest that ketamine was being mixed with pseudoephedrine which was being extracted in the Accused's kitchen. 
The Crown case - Grose Wold - pseudoephedrine
31Police found in the Accused's kitchen a small, resealable, plastic bag containing 13 ""Chemist's Own Sinus Relief"" tablets, each containing 60 milligrams of pseudoephedrine (Grose Wold photographs, pink tab 2, no. 3). Underneath the Accused's bed, police discovered a large, resealable, plastic bag containing 867 ""Panadol Sinus"" tablets, each containing 30 milligrams of pseudoephedrine, a further 432 ""Panadol Sinus"" tablets, each containing 30 milligrams of pseudoephedrine and 697 ""Panadol Cold and Flu Middle East"" each containing 30 milligrams of pseudoephedrine. In the second drawer of the Accused's beside table was found a cardboard box containing a further 620 tablets (either ""Panadol Sinus"" or ""Panadol Cold and Flu Middle East"") each containing 30 milligrams of pseudoephedrine. Mere mathematics tell me that this amounts to 79.26 grams of pseudoephedrine, which is the amount pleaded in count 4 in the indictment. 
32In a ruling made on 4 October 2012, I dealt with four different submissions made by the defence. Commencing at [18] I dealt with a submission that there was no evidence of the presence of the precursor drug pseudoephedrine. Essentially the Accused argued that those proprietary drugs did not satisfy the statutory criteria to amount to the prescribed precursor drug. I need not repeat what I said at that time. My reasons have been transcribed and are available. I rejected the submission and held that the prescribed precursor within the proprietary medication satisfied the statutory criteria.  
Background - Leppington
33In 2004 Mr Daryl Galway was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months for manufacturing a prohibited drug at Llandilo and multiple firearm offences. His non-parole period was 1 year and 3 months (exhibit U). He was released from the John Morony Correctional Centre on 24 June 2005 on parole. Whilst he was in custody his partner, Ms Angela Barry and their children moved to a house known as 151A Dickson Road, Leppington (""Leppington""). On his release to parole, Mr Daryl Galway moved into that property. The property is on the western side of Dickson Road. At the front of the property, on its northern side is the house known as 151 Dickson Road. On the southern side of no. 151 is a driveway. On the Southern side of the driveway is no. 151A but it is set back further on the property than number 151. About 40 metres further west is a large shed which was formerly used as a chicken laying shed. It is on the northern side of the driveway. The driveway which gives access to both no. 151 and no. 151A and the chicken shed can be closed by a gate attached to the northern side of the house, no. 151A.
34Mr Daryl Galway (hereafter ""Daryl"") decided to rent this shed from the owner of the property, a Mr Ibrahim. Daryl said that he rented the shed either six or eight months after he moved to no.151A, i.e. either late 2005 or early 2006. However, Zahra DCJ records that Daryl told police on 4 June 2009 that he commenced renting the shed one month after moving to no. 151A. His purpose in renting the shed was ""just to store furniture and excess stuff and a few cars, and bits and pieces"" (T59.11). The weekly rental was $120. At a time he could not specify in his evidence-in-chief, he told his brother, the Accused, that he had rented the shed and that if the Accused need to store anything there he could do so (T61.02). At that time the Accused was living at Llandilo, but was moving (back) to Grose Wold. From the evidence of the Accused, as I found when discussing the background at Grose Wold, that move was in late 2006 or early 2007. According to Daryl, the Accused moved some household furniture, quite a few cars and a hoist into the shed and put firewood that he had around the side of the shed (T61.29). That evidence is consistent with the Accused's evidence. Daryl put a padlock on the sliding door at the front of the shed. He gave one key to the Accused and kept one for himself. 
Execution of the search warrant at Leppington
35Police executed a search warrant at Leppington at 10am on Wednesday 20 May 2009. Seven police were initially involved. No one was home at no. 151A. Police telephoned Daryl and advised him that they were executing a search warrant. The only item of significance to the police found in the dwelling house was Daryl's key to the chicken shed. Police from the Chemical Operations Unit had attended with the ordinary police and had gone directly to the chicken shed. Prior to doing that, however, police had to force the gate on the side of no. 151A that barred their access up the driveway to the chicken shed. The gate was closed with a padlock. It was a ""decent sized lock"" that caused one of the bigger policemen to ""strain with a set of bolt cutters"" (T23.24) to cut it. Police from the Chemical Operations Unit were not able to obtain access to the chicken shed until the key was obtained from the search of the house. DSC Reay said this:
""...the police from the chemical operations unit were trying to gain access, and they couldn't, there was no loose panels. There was a heavy-duty lock, I believe it couldn't be cut, it was quite heavy-duty. You could see through a crack, I think, in one panel, that there might have been some items, relevant to our inquiries.""
Then DSC Mackay gave this evidence:
Q. If I can just refer you to that. Did you attempt to gain access to the large chicken shed?A. I did. We were conducting a search, a cursory search, outside of the residence and particularly the large shed in the rear yard. The front of it was closed and locked and all the way around the outside was closed and I tried to pry back a piece of metal sheeting on the outside to peer inside.  It was really quite difficult to pull back and I was able to see briefly inside the building.
Q. Okay. You described the security for the shed as, in paragraph 7, 'a large commercial padlock of significant strength and security.'A. It was a very sturdy and strong and commercial,  in fact, I don't think I've seen anything as strong ever before ... It was physically large in size and made of quite strong steel.
Q. Is your evidence that until that lock was able to be unlocked, you were unable to gain access to the shed?A. That's correct.
I have quoted this evidence at this time as it will be necessary later to contrast it with the evidence of Daryl. 
36Then DSC Mackay did not notice any particular smell in or about or from the shed (T164). He was challenged about that (T165) but I accept his evidence that there was no unusual smell coming from the shed, such as an ""agricultural"" smell, the smell of chickens or of chicken droppings or manure, or of any chemical smell. At the time of the execution of the warrant, the weather was fine but later changed as it rained heavily from time to time (T23.44). Nevertheless, there was no change of smell detected by then DSC Mackay.
37On gaining access to the shed, police found another clandestine laboratory. The search process adopted at Grose Wold, which I summarised in [15] above was then again carried out. The video recording of the site assessment for Leppington is exhibit C. There are in evidence two sketch plans of the chicken shed, one in exhibit A and exhibit R. The police identified seven areas within the shed, marked as A to G but provided no verbal description of these areas. By contrasting the sketch plan in exhibit A and exhibit R it is possible to do so. Before I do that, I shall briefly describe the shed. It is rectangular, the long side (that running south to north) being much greater than its width (east to west). As I have already stated its doors are on the southern wall, and provide the only access. Within the shed, immediately east of the doors is a room identified as B. Its rear wall is the southern wall of the shed. Its east and west walls run parallel to the east and west walls of the shed. Its northern wall contains an entry door. It could be considered to be a small office or storeroom. Between the eastern wall of room B and the eastern wall of the shed is an area identified as A. The sketch plan in exhibit A suggests that this area is wholly enclosed but it is not. The ""northern wall"" suggested by the exhibit A sketch did not exist. Area A was open to the rest of the shed. Roughly in the middle of the shed was a vehicle hoist and north of that was a line of motor vehicles. 
38The areas identified by the police can be described in the following way. The bracketed number on the right side of this table is the number of items identified by the police. The bracketed number on the right side of this table is the number of items identified by the police.
A:Open area in the south east corner of the shed, which contains a bench.(49)B:The small room I have just described, which also contains a bench.(40)C:A bench along the eastern wall of the shed, closer to the middle of the shed than area A.(64)D:Another bench, free-standing, at a right angle to bench C.(14)E: An area where there were three IBCs, north of D and east of the vehicle hoist.(22)F:An area west of the vehicle hoist, containing a vat identified as F01(5)G:An area on the western side of the shed, south of area F but north of the entry doors.(21)
39The ""exhibit log"" for Leppington is exhibit M. As was the case for Grose Wold, exhibit A contains a photograph of each of the 215 items that were of interest to the police. Further photographs of certain items taken from a video displayed to Mr Ballard when he gave evidence are exhibit S.
Chemical analysis - Leppington 
40At Leppington police took 138 primary samples, of which 28 were sent to NMI for analysis (T140.05). Exhibit P lists items not sampled by the forensic chemists, and they number 78. The sum of 138 and 78 is 216, not 215 (another small mystery). Exhibit P1 tells me that six items (B36, B38, B40, C04, C42, C56) were sent to DAL for analysis. Exhibit M shows the following destinations for items not destined for NSW Waste:
DAL:B36, B38Case Officer:B40, C42, C56, C60DNA: B41 (ceramic coffee mug), C58 (cigarette butts)
I suspect that the designations ""DAL"" and ""case officer"" represent the same phenomenon. C04, which was destined for NSW Waste was a blister pack of ""Sudafed"" said to contain 60 milligrams each. DAL analysis reveals 13 ""Sudafed Sinus and Nasal Decongestants"" tablets, each containing 60 milligrams of pseudoephedrine. The items sent for DNA analysis did not return the Accused's DNA but may have identified another or others. 
41Appendix 1 to Mr Ballard's report of 3 May 2010 tabulates the items sent to NMI for analysis, the quantity of the chemical exhibit and the result of the analysis. It is this:Item No.DescriptionQuantityResultA20Brown liquid from 1L reaction flask50mL11.6% pseudoephedrineTraces d-MAA24Purple-red liquid and sludge from 1L reaction flaskNot recordedSolid - consistent with red phosphorus Liquid - acidic with iodide ionsA43Red-brown two phase liquid in Berri juice bottle2.4L0.13% pseudoephedrineTraces d-MAAlso P2P and chlorpheniramineB7Orange liquid from 250mL vacuum flask150mL0.75% pseudoephedrineB8Orange liquid from 500mL reaction flask400mL  0.20% pseudoephedrineB17Pale brown liquid from 3L reaction flaskNot recorded 0.15% pseudoephedrineB25Yellow liquid from 500mL Schott bottle300mL0.04% pseudoephedrine0.08% d-MAC1Moist purple red substance from glass jarNot recordedConsistent with red phosphorusC16Pale blue liquid and solid from 500mL Schott bottle50mLTraces pseudoephedrineC45Pale brown liquid from 20L Handypail20L0.22% pseudoephedrineC47Brown liquid from plastic drum50L 0.09% pseudoephedrineC48Viscous brown liquid from 200L plastic drum60L0.1% d,1-MDMA0.04% d, l MAC55 Dark crystalline solid from 1L glass jarHalf fullConsistent with iodineC61Liquid from glass bottle marked ""PHOS"" 150mL150mLNo prohibited substance detectedD5Dark brown liquid from 5L separating funnel2.5L0.31% d,l-MDMA0.14%d,l-MAE9Dark brown liquid from modified beer keg21.4kg grossTraces d,l-MDMA and pseudoephedrineAlso chlorpheniramineE10Dark brown solid and liquid from beer keg (1/2) full35.4kg grossTraces pseudoephedrineE11Solid from modified beer keg (3/4 full)43.4kg grossd-MA, d-amphetamine and d,l-MDMAAlso methylamineE13Dark brown liquid from IBC520L*Traces of d,l-MDMAE14Brown liquid from IBC900L*Traces d,l-MDMAE15Brown liquid from IBC730L*Traces d, l-MDMAAlso methylamineE16Brown liquid from post-mix 'keg'10.4kg0.53% d,l-MDMA<0.2% d,l-MAE17 Brown liquid from 200L plastic drum200LTraces d,l-MDMAAlso methylamineE18Brown liquid from large steel vatSmall amountTraces d,l-MDMAF1Scaping of residue from steel vatNot recorded0.52% pseudoephedrineG1Brown liquid from plastic drum25L0.04% d-MATraces pseudoephedrineG2Brown liquid from plastic drum20L0.14% pseudoephedrineG3Brown liquid from plastic drum20LTraces pseudoephedrineG14Glass beads and white solid from large PVC pipe condenserNot recordedPseudoephedrineN.B.

The item which was not tested, C60, is described in exhibit M as a ""cardboard box containing [a] plastic container and newspaper.""
42The only differences about the manufacture of MA at Grose Wold and Leppington concern the ingredients used in the reflux and the resulting form of MA. At Leppington red phosphorous was being used in place of hypophosphorus acid (T211.43). At Leppington d-,l-MA was found present in traces indicating that that form had been manufactured there. For the manufacture of d-,l-MA the precursor used is P2P (T212.16). Methylamine can also be used for this purpose (T212.46). 
43Mercifully, evidence of the process of the manufacture of MDMA was not given in the same detail as it was of MA. There are a number of different precursors used for the manufacture of MDMA. The two predominant chemicals so used are safrole and piperonal (T213.11). If methylamine be used, it will provide the form d-,l- MDMA (T212). Mr Ballard gave this evidence as to how MDMA is made:
Q. All right. Can you describe for us, just in details that we can understand, the typical manufacturing process, starting with the safrole or piperonal taking us through to production of MDMA.A. From safrole, the general synthesis route that's taken is via an intermediate compound. It's called MDP2P or ... 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, which is the methylenedioxy equivalent of the P2P, which is used to manufacture the methylamphetamine.  There are different synthetic pathways to ... go from the safrole to the MDP2P using different precursor chemicals or different reagents.  From that point the MDP2P there are a few different ways that that can be converted to MDMA. From the piperonal, that can be converted to an intermediate product. One of the ways is via an intermediate nitro compound, which is then converted to the - it can either be converted back to the MDP2P or through to MDMA. There are different pathways using different precursors and different reagents for each precursor.
The Crown case - Leppington
44In his report concerning Leppington, that of 3 May 2010 (part of exhibit N), par 16, Mr Ballard pointed out that pseudoephedrine could be identified in items A20, A43, B7, B8, B17, B25, C16, C45, C47, E10, F1, G1, G3 and G14. To that list can be added B38, C42 and C56. C55 was analysed to be iodine and, according to Mr Ballard, B35 which was not analysed, had the appearance of iodine. Items A24 and C1 were both analysed as red phosphorous. These are the basic ingredients for the manufacture of MA. Containers were also found which had initially contained methylated spirits (A05, A38, D14, G10, G21) acetone (A09), caustic soda (A26, C53, E03, G07), and hydrochloric acid (A42, B06, C02, C08, C30, D04).
45In par 20, Mr Ballard lists scientific glassware commonly used in the manufacture of both MA and MDMA and in par 21 equipment commonly used in those processes including electrical apparatus, a pH meter, a pressure cooker and a vacuum pump. In his oral evidence Mr Ballard said this:
Q. Dealing with methylamphetamine were you able to form any opinion as to, firstly, whether the manufacture of methylamphetamine was capable of being carried out at the Leppington premises?A. Yes, I did. I determined that there were the necessary precursor chemicals, being the pseudoephedrine, the iodine, and red phosphorus, which were present at the location. And there were also suitable vessels and other equipment to carry out that process.
The photographic evidence (in exhibit A) of items in situ at Leppington clearly shows that a manufacturing process had been carried on, in particular photos 3 and 4 of area A, photo 6 of room B, photo 8 of bench C, and photo 10 of bench D. Photographic evidence in exhibit S shows the vat F01 (no's 1,2 and 3) with a green plastic bucket beneath it (F02) in which pulverised proprietary medicines had been mixed with methylated spirits, leaving in the bottom of the vat and in the bucket below it a white substance analysed to contain 0.52% pseudoephedrine, clearly a residue of that chemical in the white waste of the fillers and binders of proprietary medicines. The vat could be easily used to decant pseudoephedrine dissolved in methylated spirits from the heavier layer below. Photo no. 12 in exhibit S gives a clear view of a bench tops in area A which at one time had been set up to carry on a chemical process. Photo no.17 in exhibit S gives the a clear view of the bench in room B similarly set up.
46Par 18 of Mr Ballard's report of 3 May 2010 is this:
""Analysis of a number of seized items identified the presence of methylamphetamine. Methylamphetamine was identified in the form of d-methylamphetamine (items A20, A43, B25, E11, G1) and d,l-methylamphetamine (items C48, D5, E16). This indicates at least two different methods of methylamphetamine manufacture. More than 85 litres of liquids containing methylamphetamine were seized by police. Additionally, the methylamphetamine was present in low or trace quantities in these items. In my opinion, these items are the waste product from the manufacture of greater than a large commercial quantity (>1 kilogram) of methylamphetamine at 151A Dickson Rd, Leppington.""
I have concerns about this statement. E11 (43.4kg gross) contains as well as traces of d-MA, traces of d-amphetamine d-,l-MDMA and also of methylamine. It is impermissible in my view to state it is the waste product of the manufacture of d-MA when it contains traces of other drugs and when no attempt has been made to ""apportion"" what part might be applicable to the manufacture of d-MA. Likewise C48 contains an estimated 0.10% of d-,l-,MDMA but only 0.04% of d-,l-MA. E16 contains 0.53% d-,l-MDMA but less than 0.2% d-,l-, MA. Those waste products clearly contain an admixture of the waste of the manufacture of both MDMA and MA using P2P. One cannot state that it is conclusively the waste product of the manufacture of MA, and no attempt has been made by the Crown to try to ""apportion"" the waste product between MA and MDMA. The next concern I have is that a large commercial quantity of MA (1kg) is derived from 85 litres of waste product only if one applies the 1:10 ratio which I discussed at [25] above. Applying the preferable 1:100 ratio one only arrives at 850 millilitres of MA. If the density of the waste is the same as water the most that could be found would be 850g of MA i.e. a commercial quantity (250g or more).
47I am prepared to accept that the following items can be accepted beyond reasonable doubt as the product of the manufacture of MA found at Leppington:
Item No.DescriptionQuantityAnalysisA20Brown liquid from 1 L reaction flask50mlTraces of d-MAA43Red-brown two phase liquid in juice bottle2.4LTraces of d-MAB25Yellow liquid from Schott bottle 300mlTraces of d-MAG1Brown liquid from plastic drum25LTraces of d-MA
The total volume of these liquids is 27.75 litres. Assuming a density equivalent to the density of water that is 27.75kilograms. Applying the ratio 1:100, that equates to 0.2775 kilograms of MA, i.e. slightly more than the commercial quantity of MA (250g). I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that a commercial quantity of MA had been manufactured at Leppington. 
48I turn now to the issue of MDMA at Leppington. Par 19 of Mr Ballard's report of 3 May 2010 is this:
""Analysis of a number of seized items identified the presence of MDMA (items C48, D5, E9, E11, E13, E14, E15, E16, E17, E18). More than 2400 litres of liquids containing MDMA were seized by police. The MDMA was present in low or trace quantities in these items. In my opinion, these items are the waste product from the manufacture of many kilograms of MDMA at 151A Dickson Rd, Leppington.""
In par 20 of the same report, Mr Ballard pointed out that the largest flask seized at Leppington had a 20 litre capacity. The generation of more than 2,400 litres of liquid MDMA waste equated to more than 120 instances of MDMA manufacture. If small flasks were used there would have been ""several hundred"" instances of MDMA manufacture.
49However, the Crown presented its case on counts 7 and 7A on two different bases. The first base is that I have just outlined. The second base takes into account evidence given by Daryl Galway and concessions made by Mr Ballard. Items E13, E14 and E15 are IBCs - large, rigid box-shaped plastic containers, themselves contained in large metal mesh boxes and designed to contain 1,000 litres. (T214.20). Each contained MDMA waste, totalling 2,150 litres. In chief, i.e. in the Crown case, Daryl Galway gave this evidence:
Q. Did you see anything happening in relation to one or any of those three containers?A. I seen a white tip truck, 8 to probably 8 to between 8 and 12 tonne tip truck that had, to my description, like a water cart on the back of it and he was pumping what was in the back of that into them plastic containers; pallecons or whatever you want to call it.
Q. Whereabouts was that happening?A. At Llandilo sorry, at Leppington.
Q. Whereabouts on the property at Leppington?A. In front of the shed.
Q. Did you speak to the fellow who was doing the pumping?A. No, I didn't, I just seen him.
Q. Had you ever seen him before?A. No, I haven't.
Q. Have you ever seen him since that occasion?A. No.
Q. Did you try and find out what he was doing?A. I just seen he was pumping something out of there into them pallecons and, as I said, I didn't want to know nothing about it so I didn't ask questions.
HIS HONOUR
Q. Just help me, Mr Galway.  You said it was a 10 tonne, what sort of truck was it?A. It was a tip truck.
Q.  A tip truck, and what did you ...A.  Between 8 and 12 tonne tip truck.
Q. A white tip truck, I think?A. Yes. It was a big one, yep.
Q. Carting a water cart. The pumping was what, from the cart into these square. A. Into these square tanks.
Q.  Were there any marking on the tip truck itself?A.  It was plain white.
Q.  What about the water cart?A.  It was just a rusty looking tank that was on there.
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. Were you able to notice anything about the liquid that was being pumped or tipped?A.  I just sort of seen it going in and that was about it cause where he had it coming out of, the tank, it was a clear tube and it just looked like mud going through there.
Q. By reference to when your twins were born are you able to say when you saw this, before or after?A. It was probably way after, it might have been ... I'm just not sure.
Q. Did you ever speak to your brother, Les, about seeing this brown liquid being pumped?A. No, I didn't speak to him about that.
On the same issue Mr Ballard said this in chief:
Q. Dealing with those large quantities of waste first of all particularly in the IBCs. Do they necessarily represent the results of manufacturing carried on at Leppington or could they be equally consistent with containing waste material that may have been the product or by-product of manufacture at some other location?A. The IBCs themselves I can't tell. I can't determine whether it was added to the IBCs there or brought in. There was a large steel vat near the IBCs, E18, which contained a small amount of a brown liquid. It contained traces of MDMA in that liquid and that large steel vat. I'm not sure, it would, just an estimate, probably hold a couple of thousand litres of liquid if it was full, but in the side of that vat towards the base there was a hole which was connected to on the outside to piping through to a pump, like a water pump, and then that had further piping coming off that pump.  It's possible that that could have been brought from another location too, but that's another item like a storage item which had at least somewhat I believe to be MDMA reaction waste in it and could be used to pump liquid into the IBCs from that vat with the attached pump.
A little later he said this:
Q. Now, I've asked you about the IBCs containing the liquid based with traces of MDMA and whether that  I think you've told us that could have been equally consistent with being transported from another location or the product of manufacture at that location?A. Yes.
Bearing in mind the standard of proof required, I cannot take the waste in the IBCs into account in trying to determine the amount of MDMA that may have been manufactured at Leppington. After all, Daryl Galway referred to the IBCs using the plural number when describing the pumping process. It had to involve two of the three IBCs and could well have involved all three.
50Hence Mr Crown, in addresses, sought to support these counts with the following items.
ItemDescriptionQuantityAnalysisC48Viscous brown liquid from 200L plastic drum.60L0.1%d,l MDMA and 0.04% d-l MAD05Dark brown liquid from 5L separating funnel2.5L0.31% d,l MDMA and 0.14% d,l MAE09 Dark brown liquid from modified beer keg.21.4kgTraces of d,l, MDMAE11Solid from modified beer keg43.4kgd-MA, d- amphetamine, d-l MDMA, methyleneE16 Brown liquid from post-mix keg10.4kg0.53% d-l MDMA and less than 0.2% MAE17Brown liquid from 200L plastic drum200LTraces of d,l MDMAE18 Brown liquid from large steel vat""small amount""Traces of MDMA
The problem which arises is, again, of admixture of wastes. The only items which contain solely MDMA waste are E09, E17 and E18. Assuming that the density of the waste is the same density as of water, 200 litres equals 200 kilograms (T204.01). The total weight of E09 and E17 is, therefore, 221.4 kilograms. Applying the 1:100 ratio that gives a weight of MDMA of 2.214 kilograms, which is much greater than the large commercial quantity of that drug (500 grams) The waste could be much denser than water but one would not assume it to be double the density. That conforms with Mr Ballard's evidence at T204.
51Mr Ballard said in his evidence that none of the precursors or reagents used in the manufacture of MDMA were located at Leppington (T213.47) However, as I have already pointed out, all the necessary equipment was. I am persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that a large commercial quantity of MDMA was manufactured at Leppington, about 2 kilograms of it, as I have just found. It defies commonsense that Leppington was a mere storage area for MDMA waste from elsewhere. One would have expected all of it to be in the IBCs.
The credibility of Daryl Galway
52Before going on to consider the defence case, Daryl Galway's credibility must be considered, especially in light of the direction I have considered concerning the evidence of those reasonably supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to these proceedings. Of his own memory Daryl said this:
""My memory, my memory sometimes is just totally a mess. Like, dates, figures, times, everything else, I just cannot remember sometimes. It's bad enough trying to remember me kids' birthdays, let alone me own.""
Shortly after saying that, he admitted to have had an addiction to amphetamine (""Speed"") and gave this evidence:
Q. To the best of your understanding of yourself has that had an effect on your ability to remember things as well?A. I think it's had an effect on just about everything.
In cross-examination he admitted that the Accused was his younger brother but was unsure how much younger (T83).
53Earlier, at [34] I pointed out a discrepancy between what Daryl told me on 26 September 2011 (D2) and what was recorded by Zahra DCJ as to what he told police on 4 June 2009 as to when he commenced to rent the chicken shed. I also pointed out that he could not specify in his evidence-in-chief when it was that he offered his brother the use of the shed for storage, but I dated it to the time when the Accused was moving from Llandilo back to Grose Wold (late 2006 to early 2007). Zahra DCJ records Daryl telling the police on 4 June 2009 that it was ""one or two weeks after he started renting the shed, [that] he provided his brother ... with keys to the shed."" This, of course, cannot be used against the Accused, but it can be seen as an inconsistency of Daryl's making. He was cross-examined about this. At T86.47 this evidence was given:
Q. How long ago do you say that he moved items into the shed after you rented the shed, you're probably not able to remember?A. It may have been 6 months, it may have been 12 months, I, I don't know.
He was then taken to the ERISP he gave to the police on 4 June 2009 and this evidence was given:
Q. You were asked the question at 209: ""Okay, so how long after you started renting the shed did Les start moving items to the shed?""  You said, ""Sort of within a week or two."" Does that now help you remember, having read that question and your answer, when it was that Les started moving items into the chicken shed?A. Yeah, he, yes.
Q. When you say, ""yeah"", what does it help you remember now?A. Well, it's just sort of when he started moving stuff into the shed.
Q. Was that within a week or two of the discussion you had with him after you rented the shed?A. Yes.
This inconsistency is not trivial. There is a substantial period of time between July and August 2005 and late 2006, early 2007, a period of nearly one and a half years.
54Another inconsistency concerns the gate across the driveway which gave access to the chicken shed. Daryl said in chief that the Accused was free to come and go from the shed, as he had a key to it. This evidence was then given:
Q. I was asking you about whether you saw Les at the shed at Leppington.A. Yes.
Q. You told us that on occasion you did.A. Yes.
Q. I think you agreed that he could come and go without any reference to you because he had a key to the door of the shed.A. Yeah, because the driveway was right between two houses and there was a public thoroughfare because the people that were renting the market garden at the back, they were using the driveway as well, everyone was using the driveway.
Q. Did the driveway have a gate on it?A. It had a gate, yes.
Q. Was the gate ever locked?A. No.
Q. Never.A. It was at certain times, after 9 o'clock.
Nine O'clock is a clear reference to 9pm. Contrast this evidence with the evidence of police executing the warrant, who had to cut through a large padlock to open the locked gate at 10am, as I pointed out at [35] above.
55Another and more notable inconsistency between the evidence of Daryl and the police concerns the ease of access to the shed. I quoted in [35] above the evidence of DSC Reay and the DSC Mackay as to the inability of the police to enter the shed without the key. Contrast that evidence with this:
Q. And you've told us that Les had a key to the shed, so is this the case, as far as you were concerned, he could come and go as he pleased?A. Well, anyone could come and go, cause if they walked around the side of the shed, there was three sheets of tin missing off the side of the shed, and all they would have had to done is just walk through. Not necessarily have a key to unlock the door.
Q. But nonetheless, you had a key and kept it locked?A. Yes. For me own peace of mind.
HIS HONOUR
Q. Did you ever repair those holes in the shed?A. No. The shed was that old, it was just starting to fall apart.
Q. If somebody had repaired it, it wasn't you, is that right?A. I didn't repair it, no.
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. But it wasn't in that state, as of May 2009, was it?A. What was that, sorry?
Q. The shed wasn't in that state as of May of 2009, was it?A. It was like that from the day that I started paying rent on the shed.
The desire of Daryl to downplay the security of the shed and to highlight the ease with which it could be entered I find sinister, and consistent with someone who was criminally concerned. 
56The next area in which I find myself unable to accept Daryl's evidence concerns smells. At [14] above, I described a smell noticed by police executing the search warrant at Grose Wold that was detected in the shed at that site. At [36] above I described the lack of any smell noticed by then DSC Mackay when the search warrant was executed at Leppington. It is to be borne in mind that in 2002 Daryl was arrested and charged with manufacturing a prohibited drug at Llandilo and multiple firearm offences. For that he appeared before this Court sitting at Penrith in April 2004 and was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 6 months, as recorded at [33] above. In cross-examination Daryl said this:
Q. You pleaded guilty, didn't you, at the Penrith District Court, in relation to manufacturing a prohibited drug, I think you pleaded guilty in or about April 2004?A. I've got no idea.
Q. I think you can remember that you pleaded guilty to that offence?A. Yes, that's what I was sent to gaol for. You don't forget that.
The last sentence of the last answer is something which I can wholly accept. Yet the first answer recorded does not sound truthful. Release on parole on 24 June 2005 after a non-parole period of 1 year and 3 months indicates that the sentence was passed in late April 2004 (but obviously not on 25 April 2005). The commencement date of Daryl's sentence may have been the result of backdating to account for some pre-sentence custody. Earlier, Daryl said in chief:
Q. 2002 that you were arrested.A. Mm hmm.
Q. All right. Was it amphetamine based prohibited drugs?A. I assume it was.
The last answer is implausible: He must have known what he was manufacturing that led to his arrest and sentencing. He had been, and probably was, at that time addicted to amphetamine. He would have known the smell of the reflux involved in manufacturing amphetamine. At T70 he admitted noticing a ""stinky putrid smell"" in 2002. The evidence soon continued thus:
Q. So my question is: in what circumstances in 2002 had you smelt that putrid smell?A. I can't recall on that, in 2002, I have no idea.
HIS HONOUR
Q. Let's look at this way, Mr Galway:  had you smelt it when you went to the Easter Show when you were in the cattle pavilion?A. Yes.
Q. Had you smelt it at a residence at Llandilo?A. No.
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. Just have another read of paragraph 17, just to yourself, if you would.  Have you read that, Mr Galway?A.  Yes.
Q. Thank you. You've told us that you'd smelt this particular putrid smell back in 2002?A. Yes.
Q. 2002 was the date of your arrest for the offence in relation to manufacturing of prohibited drugs?A. Yes.
Q. What were the circumstances in which you'd smelt this particular putrid smell that you smelt at Grose Wold back in 2002?A. I just, I can't recall.
Q. Was it anything to do with the circumstances that saw you arrested for the manufacture of prohibited drugs?A. I assume so.
The first, penultimate and last answers just quoted I find implausible, an attempt by Daryl to minimise his earlier criminal activity.
57The Crown was seeking to adduce from Daryl evidence that he had smelt this ""stinky putrid smell"" both at the Accused's shed at Grose Wold and emanating from the chicken shed at Leppington. At T66.04 Daryl said there were ""strange smells"" at Grose Wold - smells which, on the Crown case, ought not to have been ""strange"" to Daryl. After being permitted to refresh his memory from a statement, Daryl said that he smelt the ""stinky, putrid smell"" at Grose Wold (T70). At T76, Mr Crown turned Daryl's attention to Leppington:
Q. You told us about the putrid smell that you smelt at Grose Wold on the one time you went into the shed and told us about your observations there.A. Yeah.
Q. Did you ever smell that smell from the shed at Leppington?A. It mightn't have been the smell but it was a similar smell.
Q. Did you ever go and have a look to see what, if anything, was going on when you smelt the similar smell?A. No, I didn't.
Q. About how many times do you think might have smelt that similar smell?A. I can't recall, it may have been two, three times, it may have been one time, I just can't recall.
Q. On those occasions, be they two or three or however many, that you smelt the similar smell, do you have any recollection about whether Les was at the Leppington shed at those times?A. Well I physically didn't see him with me own two eyes there at certain times, he may have been there, he may not have been there.
HIS HONOUR
Q. Did you ever see his car there?A. I've seen his car there several occasions.
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. On any of these occasions when you smelt this similar smell did you see Les's car?A. Yes.
In cross-examination, Daryl said that when he first entered the chicken shed, i.e. when he first rented in, there was a ""disgusting smell"" in the chicken shed (T85.36). At T94 he went on to say this:
Q. Well you said, I think, that you detected a smell or something in the shed or coming from the shed.  Did you say that earlier?A. Yes.
Q. Well could that smell have been something to do with the shed itself rather than the smell that you recognised from an earlier time at Grose Wold?
HIS HONOUR: At Llandilo I think you meant to say.
WENDLER
Q. Or Llandilo.A. It could have been coming from the actual shed itself because we may have had rain and the floor may have been wet, the smell might have been coming from there or it may have been the previous smell that I had detected.
Q. Wasn't the position this, that when it rained the smell coming from the industrial chicken shed was multiplied, so to speak, on those occasions; that it was very strong and overpowering?A. Yes, it was, yes.
Q. You could smell it in the house, couldn't you?A. You could smell it right down to the front driveway.
58The question of odours from the chicken shed was the first subject in re-examination:
Q. Was the shed structure at Grose Wold a chicken shed structure like the one at Leppington?A. No, it wasn't.
Q. The smell you smelt there was different from the chicken shed smell that you occasionally smelt at Leppington, wasn't it?A. Yes, it was, yes.
Q. If I call it the chicken shed smell do you understand what I'm talking about, that smell you've been describing that was stronger after it rained at Leppington?A. Yep.
Q. That was a smell that you smelt from time to time whilst you were living at Leppington, wasn't it?A. Sometimes it was in the summer months it was very constant. It was   because you had market gardens all around us and fertilising and everything else it may have been all that in the summer months, the winter months with rain and everything, it may have been a confusing  
Q. Sure. So this is the case: in the summer months sometimes the chicken shed smell was stronger because of the heat?A. Yes.
Q. After rain the chicken shed smell might become stronger because of the rain?A. Yes, yes.
Q. It was a smell that you were quite used to whilst you were living at Leppington?A. I wouldn't say I was quite used to it.
Q. I'm not suggesting that you liked it, but you became familiar with it from time to time?A. Yes.
Q. Because you smelt it not regularly but on and off, depending on the weather conditions?A. Yes.
Q. It was a different smell from the smell you smelt at Grose Wold on that one occasion?A. Yes.
Q. The smell you smelt coming from Leppington on those small number of occasions you've told us about was a smell you associated with Grose Wold, wasn't it?A. Yes.
Q. Not to say there wasn't other chicken and fertiliser smells around from time to time?A. Yes.
Q. Because that was the area in which your property at Leppington was located, wasn't it?A. With all the market gardens and that around and produce well, market gardens and everything so.
At [36] I accepted the evidence of the DSC Mackay that there was no ""chicken"" smell coming from the shed in either dry or wet weather, but clearly May is not in summer. Yet Daryl asks me to believe that there was such a ""chemical smell"" arising from the manufacture of amphetamine, and also other ""agricultural"" smells that arose at Leppington. I have no confidence whatever in the reliability of this evidence. I am unable to accept any of his evidence beyond reasonable doubt unless there be adequate corroboration. 
The relationship of the Accused and Mr Alan Douglas
59To understand the defence case it is necessary to know about the relationship of the Accused and Mr Alan Douglas. The evidence about that before me comes from the Accused. I have heard nothing from Mr Douglas because he died whilst the Accused was in custody between 27 November 2008 and 11 May 2009. (T353.16) The Accused had known Alan Douglas (""Alan"") for 20 years prior to his death (T353.21) when the Accused described himself as being still ""a kid"". Initially the relationship was a friendship (T353.38) but turned into ""a friendship you couldn't get out of"" (T353.42). In his ERISP, the Accused referred to Alan as ""the old fella"" and described him as ""one of the biggest and best 'bullshitters' God ever put on this earth"" (A151).  He was not ""the sort of person you could say 'no' to"" (T353.02) because he was a ""bad man"" (T335.06). Alan was associated with biker gangs:
Q. On your understanding, was Alan associated with any other persons who you were fearful of?A. Just about every club that you could imagine.
Q. When you say, ""club"" what... A. Bikies.  He'd, ... go from one to the next, to the next, to the next, and you know  like, part ... of the reason my firewood yard sort of closed down was these bikies were extorting me. Do you know what I mean?  And ... 
Q. When you say these bikies were engaging in extortion  how did that come about?A. Through ... Alan, obviously ...   well, it took me years and years to work this out, like, that's just how it was. It took me years to find it out and then I'm slowly finding things out, and like I said he's a bad man.
Q. Did it occur to you to go to the police for instance, to report Alan?A. It's not an option, it's not an option.
Q. Why?A. I've got family. I've got kids. I've got children. Do you know what I mean? Like, and, like, and not just to one mum either. I've got a few different kids to different, like mums, and ...the police can't protect them, I'll tell you that now. You know, like ...I've seen what these people do. It's not good.
In 2004, the Accused was incarcerated ""for something"" and Alan suspected that the Accused had either given information about him to the police or was going to give information about him to the police and that led, firstly, to the Accused's being bashed in gaol and on his release, again in 2004, to Alan's shooting him in the leg (T341.50, T347.43, T392.01). In the bashings, the Accused was stabbed twice, had his jaw broken, lost teeth and suffered a perforated eardrum. In cross-examination the Accused admitted that he was under pressure ""on and off"", for a long time prior to Alan's death and even after that from his relatives and members of biker clubs.
The defence case:
60As far as Leppington is concerned the defence case is straightforward: the Accused had nothing to do with the manufacture of prohibited drugs there. The Accused merely used the chicken shed for storage purposes. The Accused said that ""at least a month to two months before"" 27 November 2008, he was approached by Daryl who told him that there were things in the chicken shed at Leppington that he wanted removed, and Daryl was unable to contact Alan to have them removed, so the Accused decided to contact Alan to get those objects removed.  However Alan was in hospital at this time and the Accused could only contact Alan after his discharge. It took the Accused almost a month to make contact with Alan (T334). Later the Accused said that Daryl went to see the accused, Daryl said, ""there's something big going on over there, I want it out of here. I don't want it there."" The Accused then went with Daryl to Leppington to have ""a look."" He then gave this evidence (T344):
Q. So when you say you went over with him and had a look what did you see at that stage?A. Basically what we've seen on the video, you know what I mean. Like when I've opened the door, right, the first thing that got me was the big bulk container things, you know what I mean, and then like to decide there was  in my eyes it looks like it was finished, it was done, it was over and done with. Looked like rubbish.
Q. Was that the only time that you saw that arrangement?A. It's the only time, yeah. And that's  like I said and then I attempted to find Alan right. Like I did find out that he had been in hospital and it wasn't   like it would had to have been six weeks after Daryl first approached me to the time that I actually caught up with Alan and that was only like a couple of weeks before the raid at Grose Wold.
61The defence case for the Grose Wold charges is different. The Accused said that on Friday 21 November 2008, Alan Douglas drove onto the Grose Wold property in a blue Holden HR utility truck, heavily laden with drums containing, in essence, most of what the police identified as items involved in the manufacture of MA that were found at Grose Wold on Thursday 27 November 2008. The tyres of the utility truck were scraping against the wheel housings and had ""almost worn through the wall of the tyres"" and the truck needed to be ""fixed"". The Accused is a panel beater/painter by trade (T331.23) and has some familiarity with motor vehicles, which he obviously collected. The Accused did not have any wheels at Grose Wold to fix the truck. He obtained wheels but ""the dish on them was wrong"" and he had to get spacer plates made for the truck. They were being made by Tempe Tyres and the Accused ""was supposed to actually pick up the spacer plates on the Friday"" i.e. the 28 November 2008. To do what needed to be done to the truck, it was necessary to unload the contents onto the Grose Wold property.
62The Accused initially said that the contents of the truck came from Leppington but his further evidence made it clear that he merely assumed that it came from Leppington, in response to his request to Alan to move ""gear"" from the chicken shed at Leppington. In cross-examination the Accused said that Alan turned up at Grose Wold ""unannounced"" and then gave this evidence: 
Q. What did you observe about this equipment on the back of the ute?A. What did you mean, like?
Q. Did you recognise what any of it was?A. Well, of course the stuff in what we're seeing like the 44 gallon drum, and there was a couple of other drums there was boxes, like there was probably half a dozen boxes which contained glassware and stuff.
Q. But it was contained in boxes the glassware?A. To start with, yes, yeah, yeah. Some things had tipped over and, like fallen out.
Q. Did Alan tell you where he was taking this material, or proposing to take it?A. To his brother's, yeah.
Q. To his brothers?A. Yeah.
Q. Whereabouts was that   did he say?A. I believe Mudgee.
The Accused believed that the unloading of the truck was only a temporary measure, until the truck could be repaired and Alan continue on his journey to Mudgee.
63Alan Douglas then asked the Accused if he could use the shed at Grose Wold ""to extract some pseudoephedrine"" (T333.49; T334.48). This was a request to which the Accused believed he could not say ""no"". This evidence was then given:
Q.  He said, ""I want to extract some pseudoephedrine in your shed"" and you agreed to that?A.  Yep, while I fixed the car, until I fixed the car.
On Friday 21 November, the Accused and Alan merely unloaded the truck. Alan then made a telephone call and someone came and picked him up. On Saturday 22 November Alan returned with two other men and ""they tinkered in and out of the shed all day sort of thing.""  Until the evening of Wednesday 26 November, Alan stayed at the Accused's house, sleeping overnight on the lounge. On the Saturday the two other men left. On the Sunday one man turned up and that man and Alan ""tinkered around in the shed."" The man who attended on the Sunday was known as ""Dave"" and was tall and skinny (T335). On the following Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday two men turned up each day to work with Alan (T364.10). On none of these days, i.e. 21 to 26 November 2008 was the Accused's daughter Teeka Cole-Galway present at the Grose Wold property.
64On Wednesday 26 November, the Accused worked in his trade at a panel beating shop in Penrith. He finished there early and then drove to Colo High School to pick up his daughter whom he drove to her mother's house at Lethbridge Park (which the Accused described as Mount Druitt) (T365.04). He then visited some friends and had a couple of bourbons and then went home (T390.32). He arrived home at probably 6.30pm or 7pm (T366.32). He found Alan and two men in his kitchen extracting pseudoephedrine (T336.37; T366.40 to T367.18). Alan and the Accused argued with one of the other men, the Accused became irate and the argument became heated. The Accused went into his bedroom, took his Glock pistol out of a drawer, loaded it and returned to the kitchen and told the other three to ""get the fuck out of my house"" (T336.47). The three men complied with this demand.
65In addition to what was brought to Grose Wold in the utility truck, the men who attended each day would bring other items such as methylated spirits, ""tins"" (T370.02) and a cardboard box with the label ""Oxford"" containing glass and plastic containers (T376.03).
66Sometime after the Accused ejected from his property those who had trespassed into his kitchen, he received a telephone call or text message from Ms Lisa Bullock who had stored with the Accused a child's bed in the form of a racing car, which she wish to retrieve. So that she did not see what had been happening in the kitchen, the Accused moved some equipment from the kitchen bench onto the floor of the dining area. As Ms Bullock was coming up the Accused's driveway, he grabbed a bag and a box of pills and ran into his bedroom with them, where they were discovered by police on the following day, despite the fact that the Accused expected that Ms Bullock would stay overnight with him if he asked her to do so, which is, of course, what she did. The Accused admitted that he was acting under the influence of MA at the time, which may have affected his judgment (T392.23). The confrontation with the three men in the kitchen was ""a hour ... [m]aybe two hours"" prior to Ms Bullock's making contact with the Accused (T392.36). She arrived ""a good hour and a half"" later (T395.16), around midnight. The Accused knew that Alan Douglas would return but he did not know when (T337.25; T397.24).
67As I noted in [13] above, the Accused was released from custody on bail, on probably 11 May 2009. He was required to report daily to police at Windsor Police Station. He did so between 12 May and 20 May 2009, the day when the search warrant was executed at Leppington. The Accused breached his bail on 21 May 2009 when a friend of his produced a doctor's certificate to the Windsor police and the Accused fled to the Central Coast where he lived under an alias, Brian Garrity, until he was arrested by police on HueHue Road, Wyee at 11.30am on 27 October 2011. The Crown did not formally submit that this flight was because of a consciousness of guilt. The defence case was that the Accused was fleeing not from the police and the administration of justice but from the associates of the late Alan Douglas. The Accused last reported to the Windsor police at 6.30pm on 20 May 2009. The Accused's evidence as to the days and dates is sometimes erratic and sometimes vague. What I am about to describe occurred, if it occurred, on Thursday 21 May 2009.
68On the morning of that day police went to the Accused's house at Grose Wold ""just checking in to see that I was going to be there and I told them, 'yes'."" That afternoon a similar car arrived at the Accused's front gate which was locked. He assumed it was the police and he went out to meet the new visitors. The Accused's evidence (at T344; 345) continued thus:
""I'm thinking, you know, what do they want. Well when I get down there two males hop out of the car, both with guns, telling me that I owe them money, right, because the stuff that was taken from me in Grose, right, belonged to them. Well next thing he pulls the trigger, right. Well I shit myself. It wasn't loaded. He told me they'd be back and next time they come back if I didn't have the money or some drugs or whatever, right, the next time it will be loaded.""
The Accused said that on that day he had ""dabbled in a bit of drugs"" and was ""a bit scattered."" This encounter caused the Accused to visit a medical practitioner:
""I went to the doctor's, right, and I told him, 'Look I'm having really bad troubles in my head and that,' you know what I mean. Like basically told him, you know, well I've got people wanting to fucking kill me and blah, blah, blah and I needed to just get some time away, I needed to get my head clear so I could start to think and, you know, like do things properly.  Well I went and got the certificate. With the certificate I went to a friend, asked them could they hand it in. With that I ended up going like that same day I went to the coast.""
The vehicle in which the two males arrived at the Accused's house was ""like a late model Magna"". The Accused gave a short description of each man (T346.34). This evidence was then given:
Q. All right, and as best your able to remember what was the, in general terms, what did they say to you?A. Basically that like what I'd been pinched with, right, they owned, it belonged to them, right. They wanted $100,000 from me, right, or they wanted their stuff back.
Q. What did you say?A. What could I say, do you know what I mean? Like I've got two blokes standing there with guns at me, you know what I mean.  Like ... 
 Q. Were they both armed or just  ...A. Both. Both. Only one pulled the trigger, but.
Q. What was the upshot of the conversation?A. Well they told me they'd be back in a couple more days, right, and with that what was I going to do? I didn't know what to do. I couldn't give them back stuff that the police had already took away from me.
Q. What sort of effect did that have on you, that particular episode?A. Well it brought back a little bit of the time when Alan shot me, you know what I mean, like a bit of flashbacks from that, but I suppose the big part of it was I was concerned for my life and my safety, you know what I mean. Like I was under the influence of drugs as well, you know what I mean, that didn't help me any at all, you know.
Q. How long did this episode take between you and these two men?A. Not 5 minutes. Not even 5 minutes. Like it took me longer to walk to the gate than what it did for the episode to, you know. Like to me it was more like a scare thing, you know what I mean. Like one, they knew where I lived.  Number two, right, I knew what club they were from.
Q. Sorry, what club? What are you referring to?A. I'd rather like motorcycle club, yeah, and I'd rather not bring names into it, you know.
This episode has been raised on two or three occasions with the Accused whilst he has been in custody and he has been bashed a few times in Long Bay Gaol (T347). In cross-examination the Accused said this:
HIS HONOUR
Q. You weren't running from the police, you were running from bikies; is that right?A. Correct, yes. I even said that in the interview, right, to Chris Reay. It weren't the police that I was running from. I know the police can't hurt me.  All they can do is they can lock me up. All right, that hurts me, right, but at the end of the day beyond that they can't hurt me. These other people can hurt me. Simple.
69I have quoted this evidence at some length because it does explain many things said by the Accused in his ERISP (exhibit T): A40 to A45, A48 to A63, A113, A137 to A165.
The credibility of the Accused:
70I found the Accused to be a somewhat exasperating witness. The number of times he answered questions in whole or in part with ""you know what I mean"" was tedious and was done sometimes to avoid making a frank concession or admission. Sometimes the Accused contradicted himself, but that occurred often because he said the first thing that occurred to him, to extricate himself, but later was more frank. On a number of occasions he said things which were inconsistent with the physical evidence but that often only indicated that he was not tailoring his evidence to fit with the Crown case, which is what many accused do. Some examples should suffice. As to the phenomenon of seeking to avoid admitting the obvious, consider this evidence in cross-examination: 
Q. Alan was associated with bikie gangs, wasn't he?A. On and on.
Q. Alan manufactured drugs for bikie gangs, didn't he?A. I didn't know that, no.
Q. He was a cook, wasn't he?A. People just say a lot of things, you know, I've never, I've never seen him done it, you know.
HIS HONOUR
Q. Your evidence was he was cooking at Grose Wold when you were there?A. Extracting pseudo that's all I know of.
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. For what purpose?A. What do you mean for what purpose?
Q. What purpose, did you understand, he was extracting pseudoephedrine?A. Well, it's obvious isn't it what do you extract pseudo for you know?
Q. Can you tell us?A. What do you mean like?
Q. You knew, didn't you, why he was extracting pseudo?A. That he was I knew he was extracting pseudoephedrine, yes.
Q. But you knew not only that, but you knew why he was extracting pseudoephedrine?A. Well, yes  it's obvious, you know.
Q. It's obvious because it's part of the process to manufacture prohibited drugs?A. Well yeah.
Q. Methylamphetamine, or whatever?A. Yep.
Q. You knew that, didn't you?A.  No.  I  ... when I ... you're making out here, now, right ...  that I'm involved in this knowing of it, right? But I'll tell you now, right ... pseudoephedrine is extracted for the use of methylamphetamine, okay right? I've read it. I've done lots of research on it, right? I've never done it, okay? Now, as far pseudo being extracted, yes, I know knew it was happening, so yes.
Q.  In fairness to you let's take it one question or one step at a time?A.  All right, yep.
Q. So firstly you agreed with the judge that you told us, of what you say, you knew Alan Douglas was extracting pseudoephedrine at Grose Wold? A. Correct.
Q. On this occasion that he came with the ute full of stuff?A. Correct.
Q. You knew that because he told you that's what he was doing?A. That's right.
Q. All right next step. You knew the reason he was extracting pseudoephedrine, didn't you?A.  Well, yes, okay, yep, yep.
Q.  Because as you say, it's obvious you don't just do it for the fun of it,  it's part of the process to manufacturing prohibited drugs, as you knew?A. Well, it's obvious, yes.
Q. Okay, so at the time, just following your evidence that Alan was using your shed and kitchen was it  to extract pseudoephedrine?A. I only agreed to the shed, right? I've come home and found him in the kitchen, and that's when I jacked up, you know.
Q. You understood he was only using the shed to extract pseudoephedrine?A. Yes.
Q. But you found out he also had been using the kitchen for the same purpose?A. Yes.
Q. All right, so let's go with that when those things were happening, to your knowledge in the shed, you knew it was part of the process of manufacturing methylamphetamine?A. But it wasn't being manufactured there.  All right, yes, it is part of a process   of course it is.
Q. And you know that's why Alan was doing it?A. Of course well, I can't say that's why he was doing it. He could have just been extracting pseudo for all I knew.  Like, I can't ... say that he was going to manufacture. We can sit here and assume that he was going to but, like, he   ... didn't actually tell me that's what he was going to do with it.
Q. We can sit here and talk around in circles  A. Of course.
Q. Or we can face the obvious, can't we Mr Galway?A. All right, go, go.
71On the issue of contradictions, consider this evidence at T334.24:
Q. Well, did you ever, yourself see it, the scientific and chemical apparatus in the shed at Leppington?A. No.
But compare that with the evidence I cited in [60] above from T344 in which he admitted to seeing at Leppington what can be seen in the site-assessment video (exhibit L). In the same vein is his assertion at T349.43 that he did not remember touching anything when he was at Leppington, although he admitted he could have (D9) whereas on D10 he said this at T430.25:
Q. Is that something that you recall or something that you assume?A. The items ... I can't recall, but I do ... remember touching things, yes.
A little later the Accused ""supposed"" that the reason he may have touched something was that he was looking ""for a bit of drugs at the time."" It must be remembered that the Accused would have been well aware that police detected his fingerprints on four items (A16, C38, A35 and D14) at Leppington.
72As to evidence inconsistent with the physical facts which does not indicate tailoring evidence to fit the Crown case, consider this evidence:
Q. If you go to A11, it's photograph A11 at tab A in exhibit A?A. Yep.
Q. You will see the glass blender that I've just referred to.A. Yep.
Q. Now that was located in the kitchen area. Do you have that open, A11?A. Yep.
Q. That your fingerprints were detected on that item. So what's your explanation as to how your fingerprints would have arrived on that item?A. It would have been originally sitting on the kitchen bench, right, and I just got everything that I sort of could see from there just moved it into the dining room part.
The Accused was told by his counsel that the glass blender jug was found in the kitchen (which it was, on the bench) but nevertheless said that he moved it to the dining area, which he clearly did not. Nevertheless, it does not mean that he did not touch it in the process of moving other items from the kitchen bench to the dining area. I have already pointed out that the police found a bag of tablets under the Accused's bed and a box of tablets in his bedside drawer. Nevertheless he said this in cross-examination:
A. Yes. There was a bag and a box and I had them in my hand when Lisa turned up and, like, I was actually walking over toward the door, you know what I mean, and that's when I went to the bedroom and I thought I threw them in my bedroom drawer.Q.  Did you put any under the bed?
A.  I don't think so, no. I don't know.
This inconsistency is of no moment in the case at all, but clearly the Accused was not trying to tailor his evidence to fit the Crown case and, clearly, his recollection of some events (and of the Crown brief) is faulty.
73A large number of minor things said by the Accused in evidence sounded truthful to me. Commencing at T368.09 Mr Crown played the site-assessment video taken at Grose Wold (exhibit B) to the Accused and asked him questions about it. At T374, Mr Crown identified on the video E08, a 30cm Buchner funnel, and the Accused volunteered (at T374.26) that he picked it up and that is one of the fourteen items on which police identified the Accused's fingerprints. Bearing in mind what I have already said about the Accused's evidence, it is highly unlikely that he could retain in his memory a picture of each of the fourteen items on which his fingerprints were found and where the item originally was, before police removed items ex situ. Another instance of this is his identifying the ""Oxford"" box that I discussed in [65] above. I also found this evidence about the refrigerator in the shed to sound truthful: 
Q. Mr Galway, we've just had a look through an old fridge/freezer combination that was in the shed; correct?A. Mm hmm.
Q. Was that brought there by Mr Douglas or was that in the shed?A. That was already there.
Q. That was already there?A. Yeah. There's items in there that weren't in there cause the fridge was empty. I don't even think it worked, you know what I mean.
Q. Was it plugged in?A. I don't know.
74Later, the Accused was taken to photographs in exhibit A of the Grose Wold items. He gave evidence about item G08:
Q. G08 the photograph there G08  have you got that?  Now, that's described in the exhibit log as being ""1 glass dish containing an amount of brown crystal substance; 1 kitchen knife, and 2 filter papers"". So I know from that  you can see the end of a piece of cutlery we know it's a knife, but did you have cutlery like that at your place?A. Not at all, no.
Q. So this would have been something that was brought there?A. Yep. I had Wiltshire brand cutlery.
He also denied that a knife shown in item G28 was one of his. These answers were plausible. In the same category I place this evidence concerning disposable gloves:
Q. The police discovered some gloves and packets of Ansell brand disposable gloves?A. Yep.
Q. Did you bring those to the property?  Did you use those?A. Depends where they were found. Because if they were found on the kitchen table, yes, I did  I did tattooing as well and yeah, if they were found in around the kitchen table area, they'd be mine, you know.
Q. All right, but if they were found in the shed area? A. Not mine.
Q. It's not an area that you would have  A. No.
Q.  ...cause to wear any gloves?A. No.
The Accused was quite prepared to make an admission and provide a credible confession, which was not challenged by the Crown. At T387, the Accused volunteered that a blue drum on the back of Alan's truck had overturned and bottles and other items came out of it and he recalled some items have sticky-tape around the lids. This, again, sounded plausible and was not challenged. 
75In summary, I am prepared to accept the Accused's evidence on a number of issues as, at least, raising a reasonable doubt. On some issues I do not accept what he said. I shall make my findings clear when discussing the individual counts in the indictment.
Counts 1 and 1A
76I accept the Accused's evidence that Alan Douglas arrived unannounced at Grose Wold on Friday 21 November 2008 in a blue Holden HR utility truck laden with most of the items discovered by police on Thursday 27 November 2008. There is some objective corroboration for the Accused's evidence, which goes further than I have already mentioned. The further considerations and objective evidence are:
(a) The utility truck can be seen in the Accused's backyard and the general photographs of the property in exhibit A, no's 8 and 9 (see also T402).
(b) The Accused gave some evidence as to what happened to the truck after the police executed the search warrant and he was not challenged by the Crown on this evidence:
Q. But Alan's ute had bad  what  tyres or wheels?A. The wheels were too wide. Like, the tyres were too wide they were scrubbing on the guard on the outside of the guard. And the springs were, like they were sagged from the weight.
Q. Was that because the ute was so heavily laden?A. Yes.
Q. Did you fix Alan's ute?A. Not properly, no like, when the police when the police raided, right, I still hadn't got the spacers for ... the wheel, like, and they can even tell you themself when they drove the car away the wheel fell off.
Q. So Alan's ute was still at the property?A. Yes, yep. Well, it turns out it was stolen.  Let's go with that?
Later this evidence was given, the questions based on the premise that the truck was still in situ on 28 November 2008 and that it was driven away by the police:
Q. On 28 November the ute was still sitting there at the property?A. Yep.
Q. When the police came to drive it away, to your observation, it was still suffering from the problem that it had when it arrived?A. Well, the wheels weren't bolted on. Yeah, no, no, no, the actual front wheels   like I said, the wheels that were on it got taken off, right?  A new set of wheels got put on, but for the front wheels to fit they needed spacer plates, and that's what I was waiting on the spacer plates. So the front wheels weren't even like, there was probably one bolt on it that's it.
(c) The photograph of item K01 was taken of it in situ. It is a blue plastic 44 gallon drum full of a brown liquid, containing 0.05% pseudoephedrine and traces of d-MA. It is obviously the waste product of the manufacture of d-MA. 44 gallons amount to 200 litres. Using the largest reaction flask found at Grose Wold, a 5 litre flask, would require 40 instances of MA manufacture. If a 3 litre flask were used that would require 66 instances. (See  [28 (h)] above). Yet the photograph shows that the drum had not been in situ for long at all - only a few blades of grass appear to have started to climb up its side, consistent with its being in place for only one week. 
(d) The Accused was cross-examined about K01 commencing at T403. The Accused agreed that it was extremely heavy. This evidence was then given:
Q. Extremely heavy?A. But it was standing upright, and then we laid it down, like we took other drums out first; then we laid it down, and then we rolled it down.
 Q. All right, but a 44 gallon drum on the rear of a utility truck would extend way over the side of the tray?A. It was high, yeah.
Q. It was high?A. It was high, yeah.
Q. It would be almost to the top of the cabin?A. Would have been over it.
Q. Over it?A. Yeah, over the height of it.
Q. And extremely heavy. So how did you get it from where you unloaded it to where it is now shown?A. We ... backed the ute up to where it is in there. Like, if you see where the ute is, like if you go to photo 10, right? You've got a pile of tyres if you come that way it's like a driveway goes through, and backed the ute up to there, and then, like, I got some timbers and like  actually, you can see the timbers just in front of the motorbike?
Q. Yes?A. Right, and I've got them timbers, and then we rolled it down the timbers, and then got it over to there and stood it back up.
Those timbers can be seen in the Accused's backyard in the general photographs of the property, no. 10, close to the drum as the Accused said. This is objective evidence to support the Accused's version.
(e) Similarly, general photograph no. 29 (""A number of 20 litre drums located at rear of premises. Drums had contained acetone and methylated spirits"") show the drums sitting on short grass or lawn and they have obviously been only recently placed there as there is not a blade of grass seen growing up the side of any drum, most of which appear to be old and rusty. Contrast this photograph and that of K01 to which I referred in (c) above with photograph no. 31 of items in situ (""chemical bottles located in grass in fence line of property"") which show the bottles surrounded by long grass. Those items were found in area ""L"". L01 was analysed as formamide, and L02 as pyridine. Each of those bottles was so labelled. There is no chemical analysis of L03 or L04 but L03 is labelled ""chloroform"" and L04 is labelled ""Benzene"". None of those chemicals has anything to do with the manufacture of MA, on the evidence before me. 
(f) Similarly, general photograph no. 28 (""View of some material located before shipping container in rear yard"") appears to show only items which have very recently been dumped. 
(g) The Accused was cross-examined about knowing Detective Bashford who was present when the search warrant was executed in 27 November 2008 and whom the Accused saw again on, probably, 21 May 2009. As to how the Accused knew him he said this: ""Understand the police don't leave me alone ... as I know lots of police... lots of police know me."" He soon said that they were visitors to his house ""plenty of times"". The Accused was soon asked how often the police had visited his house during the 12 months preceding the execution of the search warrant. This evidence was given: 
A. In that 12 month I can predict at least six times and like there was times that I wasn't even home.  I'd come home and found them there. Like they were writing down serial numbers and they had access to all the sheds.  They had access to the whole yard. The only thing they didn't have access to was my house. Now if this was going on why didn't they find it?
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. Why didn't they have access to your house?A. Because the house was locked. And when I went there like when I seen them, what was this shit about, right, a breach AVO, right, and they take me and they arrest me, right. Then I take the police back to my premises, right, to get a receipt, right, plus show them a vehicle that hadn't been moved which I was supposed to be driving, right. Why would I take them back there if I'm manufacturing drugs why would I take them back? I wouldn't. Come on.
The Accused went on to say that police had visited him because of domestic violence allegations and allegations of driving an unregistered motor vehicle. This was not part of the Accused's case in chief. The evidence came out of unwitting cross-examination commenced by Mr Crown who never suggested to the Accused that this was a fabrication or an ad hoc concoction. 
(h)Chemical analysis of some of the items found at Grose Wold indicate that they may well have come from elsewhere:
ItemDescriptionAnalysisG07Small glass jar with a green lid containing a yellow liquidPiperonyl alcohol with traces of piperonalG34Cornwell's Malt Vinegar bottle (see [30] above)1.34% pseudoephedrine0.07% d-MA0.02% MDMAG59A 2 L Coles juice bottle with a green lid containing a 2 phase orange and yellow liquidTraces of pseudoephedrine, MA and P2PI10A glass jar with a red lid containing a yellow liquid and a crystal solid63.1% phenylacetic acid.Benzyl cyanide is indicated. 
77It necessarily follows from the last finding that most of what the police found at Grose Wold came from elsewhere six days previously and, in accordance with the Accused's evidence, manufacture of prohibited drugs could only have taken place on five days, from Saturday 22 November to Wednesday 26 November 2008. The bulk of the waste matter found at Grose Wold was in K01, which I accept came on Alan Douglas' truck for reasons I have just stated. 44 gallons is just over 200 litres and that is the amount of waste matter given by Mr Ballard in his report. This has caused me to go carefully through the items collected by the police, the chemical analyses and the photographic evidence, in order to ascertain what I can in confidence accept, bearing in mind the standard of proof, points to the manufacture of MA at Grose Wold. Those items are these:
(i) A10: A plastic container with blue clips containing a silver knife and an amount of brown coloured crystalline substance found in the freezer compartment of the refrigerator of the kitchen, analysed to be 50.1% pseudoephedrine with traces of d-MA.
(ii)A55: A plastic jar with paper filter on top that contains an amount of white residue, analysed to contain 1.21% d-MA.
(iii)G28: Described in exhibit L as a 10 centimetre glass ""bottle"", but it does not appear to have any neck and appears to me to be a drinking glass or small dish or a jar (not to be closed with a screw-top lid) with brown residue and a knife, the residue being analysed to contain 10% pseudoephedrine with traces of d-MA.
(iv)H04: A round dish containing brown crystallised residue, analysed to contain 7.67% of pseudoephedrine with traces of d-MA.
I would classify items A43, B07 and G33 as probable evidence of the manufacture of MA at Grose Wold but not as proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
78I am completely unable to ascertain how much MA may have been manufactured at Grose Wold. I accept that the bulk of the waste material came from elsewhere. I am accordingly, not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either a large commercial quantity or a commercial quantity of MA was manufactured at Grose Wold. 
79I am not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused manufactured MA at Grose Wold. The question which then arises is whether the Accused knowingly took part in the manufacture or production of MA. I do not accept the Accused's averments that he did not know that Alan Douglas and his assistants were ""cooking"" MA at Grose Wold. The Accused's evidence in that regard is totally unconvincing and asks me to accept that he was not world-wise and was unaware of Douglas' reputation as a drug manufacturer, Douglas being a man whom the Accused had known for some 20 years. However, rejecting the Accused's evidence on this issue does not prove the issue beyond reasonable doubt. Rejection of the negative does not prove the positive. 
80Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 s 6 was on 27 November 2008 in the following terms:
6 Meaning of ""take part in""
For the purposes of this Act and the regulations, a person takes part in the cultivation or supply of a prohibited plant or the manufacture, production or supply of a prohibited drug if: 
(a) the person takes, or participates in, any step, or causes any step to be taken, in the process of that cultivation, manufacture, production or supply, 
(b) the person provides or arranges finance for any such step in that process, or 
(c) the person provides the premises in which any such step in that process is taken, or suffers or permits any such step in that process to be taken in premises of which the person is the owner, lessee or occupier or in the management of which the person participates.  
In the present case, the Accused admitted on numerous occasions in his evidence that he allowed Alan Douglas to extract pseudoephedrine in his shed at Grose Wold. To allow something is to permit it. To suffer something is to submit to something happening. As I pointed out much earlier in these reasons, the extraction of pseudoephedrine is a part of the process, or a step in the process, of manufacturing MA. The Accused knew that. Accordingly the Accused knowingly provided his shed to be used for a step in the process of the manufacture of MA. Accordingly, the Accused is guilty of an offence contrary to s 24(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. I quoted at [63] and [70] above, some of the evidence of the Accused in which he admitted his knowledge that pseudoephedrine was part of the manufacture of MA. This evidence should also be considered:
Q. So what were these men doing in the kitchen when you arrived back between 6.30 and 7 on Wednesday?A. Obviously a pseudo extraction.
Q. What was obvious about it?A. What do you mean?
Q. How did you know it was obviously pseudo extraction?A. Seen it before, yeah, so I knew what it was.
Q. And, what, that's when they've crossed the line, have they?A. Yeah, I didn't give anyone permission to use my house for anything.  I said the shed, okay, but not the house.
Was a child exposed to the manufacturing process at Grose Wold?
81I am not persuaded of this element beyond reasonable doubt. I accept the evidence of the Accused on this issue, supported as it is by the evidence of Ms Christine Cole, the mother of the Accused's daughter, Teeka Cole-Galway. At the relevant time Teeka was 13 years old. Up until 2008, Teeka was living with her mother at Lethbridge Park. Ms Cole gave this evidence:
A. Well she was living with me but then when she started high school she just didn't like high school whatsoever and we had a lot of trouble with her. We changed high schools. We done everything and she still didn't want to go. So then she stayed with Les for a while and he enrolled her in school so then she was living with him, but whenever he wanted to come and see her or I wanted to go there to see her it was fine, we just could go and we didn't have any set times or arrangements or anything like that, it was just whenever we wanted to or if she wanted to come to my house that was fine, he'd bring her or vice versa.
Q. Did there come a time when you realised that Mr Galway had become arrested or was arrested?A. Yeah, on the day that he got arrested I knew that because Teeka slept in my house she'd been in my house about three weeks prior to that and we took ... her to school in the morning but she wanted to go home and check the mailbox first so we dropped her off there so she could get the school bus with the kids next door and before we got home she was on the phone hysterical saying that she'd seen him with the police and whatever.
When Ms Cole was cross-examined she gave this evidence as to why she believed that Teeka had been staying with her for about three weeks:
Q. Are you sure that it was that long and not a small number of days?A. No, it was that long because I thought if it goes on like this and stays a month I may as well move her back here, but he would pick her up some afternoons and drop her at my house or I'd pick her up, whichever.   It was too much for me to get up and have to pay petrol to my friend and her get her kid up and all that, so I thought if it goes on for more than a month we'd have to work something else out and it was three weeks so it was nearly close to the month and, yeah.
I found that explanation convincing. The Accused said that Teeka had not stayed with him since Friday 21 November 2008 as, after Alan Douglas had turned up, he picked her up from school and dropped her at her mother's house, but that was what usually happened when Teeka was staying at her mother's: Ms Cole would drop Teeka at school from Lethbridge Park and the Accused would pick her up after school and take her back to Lethbridge Park, as happened e.g. on Wednesday 26 November 2008. 
82Teeka was enrolled at Colo High School, near Grose Wold on 6 March 2008 and remained enrolled until 10 June 2011, when I know that, but for the period 11 May 2009 and 21 May 2009, the Accused was not living at Grose Wold after his initial arrest. Ms Cole was still living at Lethbridge Park when she gave evidence on 9 October 2013. Accordingly I can readily accept that Ms Cole's relative geographical distance from the Colo High School was no impediment to Teeka's studying there. There is no dispute that Teeka attended Colo High School on 27 November 2008. Clearly with the consent of the Accused, DSC Reay gave this evidence on D5:
Q. Detective Reay, on Thursday, 27 November 2008 you became aware of the sighting by other police of a young woman, a girl later identified as Mr Galway's daughter, walking in the vicinity of the Scotts Farm Road property?A. Yes, I'm aware that Constable Currie who was in company of Constable Hines in a marked police vehicle they were en route to Scotts Farm Road with us just prior to 7am on that date to execute the search warrant. I'm aware that Constable Currie has provided a statement whereby he sees a person that he later identified as Teeka Cole-Galway walking from  along the Scotts Farm Road in what he described as similar to a school uniform.
Q. When Mr Galway was placed under arrest and taken to Windsor Police Station are you aware that en route he asked if the car could be stopped for the purpose of speaking to his daughter?A. Yes.
Q. On Scotts Farm Road?A. Yes.
Q.  And that that in fact occurred?A.  Yes.
Q. And I think it was Constable Currie again who was driving the vehicle or accompanying him in the vehicle at that time?A. That's right.
Q. The next day did Mr Galway's daughter, Teeka, attend the property briefly for the purpose of collecting some clothing?A. Yes, I understand that's the evidence that could be provided by Detective Sergeant or then Detective Sergeant James Hall. He observed Teeka attend the property in the company of another female. He accompanied her inside with Inspector Shoebridge that was present there to collect some belongings from inside the dwelling and then left the property.
Ms Cole gave evidence that on the morning of 27 November 2008 she dropped Teeka off at the mailbox of the Accused's house because she wished to check it and Teeka would then go to the local bus stop and catch the bus to school with the children next door (T453.27). The Accused's mailbox was some distance from his property, and Ms Cole pointed it out on the aerial photograph of the Accused's property contained in exhibit A. It is some distance from the boundary fence of any part of the Accused's property. Ms Cole also said that Teeka wished to check the mailbox for items that she had ordered that were to be delivered to the Accused's mailbox, ""hair extensions and some makeup stuff."" Ms Cole said she left Lethbridge Park at 6am, which fits in with what the police observed on the morning of 27 November 2008. 
83As to what Det. Sgt. James Hall observed on 28 November 2008, Ms Cole gave this evidence:
Q. Did Teeka need to go back to Les's place the next day?A. No, she didn't go back the next day 'cause I didn't know what was happening and what was going on and I didn't want her to be involved so she had enough clothes at my house, she didn't need to go back for a couple of days anyway.
Q. So if anyone suggested that she went back the next day to collect some clothes that would be wrong?A. Yeah, it wasn't the next day, a couple of days later she did.
Q. A couple of days later?A. Yeah. I'm not sure, I can't really remember but I know she didn't go back that day.
HIS HONOUR
Q. You mean on the day that Les was arrested?A. Yeah, she didn't go back that day at all.
It was clear to me that Ms Cole was confident Teeka did not return to the Accused's property on 27 November 2008  but was unsure as to when she may have subsequently done so. I do not accept that Ms Cole sought to mislead me. I find no contradiction between her evidence and that given in the Crown case.
84The other evidence relied on by the Crown is this evidence given by DSC Reay on D1:
Q. Now, did you find children's clothing in Teeka's room or all the other bedrooms?A. From memory, bedroom 2 did not have any children's clothing.  It was relatively sparse. I think there was a safe and a television retrieved from that room. Bedroom 3, I think, had a children's bed and some clothing stacked in it but it was fairly neat. It didn't seem to be - like it was inhabited on a regular basis. Bedroom 4 had dishevelled clothing, children's clothing of an age similar to what I'd imagine Teeka would have been then, around 13 or 14 years of age.  A room typical of being lived in by a person of that age.
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. Did you observe anything about the bedding in that particular room?A. The bedding was like someone had just gotten out of it.  It was dishevelled.
""Dishevelled"" bedding will remain in that state until someone tidies up or ""makes"" the bed. One could not lay a charge against the Accused of being a good housekeeper. He is unlikely to have made up Teeka's bed for her. The presence of a child's clothing in two different houses is common in these days of widespread parental separation. This evidence is not inconsistent with the evidence of either the Accused or Ms Cole. 
Other arguments concerning counts 1 and 1A
85It ought be clear from what I have already found that I also do not accept the evidence of Daryl Galway concerning his visit to Grose Wold. His evidence was that some considerable time before the Accused's arrest on 27 November 2008 he had visited the Accused at Grose Wold. He said, ""It might have been 12 months before that, I am not sure"". He gave this evidence in chief:
Q. Now doing the best that you can now then, did you on any occasion see Les in the shed at Grose Wold?A. Yes.
Q. Was Les doing anything on that one occasion?A. Yes.
Q. What did you observe him doing?A. He was in the shed, there was glassware set up at the back on a bench and there was that honey brown liquid that was in the flask.
Q. And in relation to the glassware set up on the bench and the honey brown liquid in one of the items of glassware, whereabouts was Les?A. He was sort of in the middle of the shed.
Q. Did you see physically what he was doing?A. I assumed that's what he was doing. I didn't physically see it with my own two eyes.
Q. At that time did you smell anything?A. Yes.
Q. Can you describe the smell?A. It's just a stinky putrid smell.
Q. Was that a smell that you had smelt before?A. Yes.
Q. In what circumstances?A. 2002.
A little later he said he saw a round flask with a neck, the circumference of which was about 8 or 9 inches containing honey-brown liquid, and attached to that was a condenser. He said he saw two other men at Grose Wold known as Rabbit and Triple M, names which are not mentioned elsewhere in the evidence. Daryl's timing of his visit is completely inconsistent with the finding I recorded in [76] above. Daryl could well be describing what he himself had done in the past. I reject this evidence from Daryl.
86Clearly the Accused's fingerprints were found on the 14 items as I have earlier mentioned. However that is quite consistent with the Accused's helping Alan Douglas to unload the utility truck on 21 November 2008 and with his touching items in the kitchen and moving some on the evening of 26 November. The only item which gives me concern is item G33 which I listed in [77] above as a probable item used in the manufacture of MA at Grose Wold. However, the fingerprint may have been placed before the jar was filled with the clear fluid. 
87Mr Crown laid stress upon certain similarities of items recovered at both Grose Wold and Leppington. However, there is no actual proof that what was taken to Grose Wold came from Leppington. Similarities are explicable by equipment having another common source e.g. Alan Douglas. Mr Crown, in his submissions emphasised the ""patina of age"" of items found at Grose Wold. However, aged items could have been taken to Grose Wold. I have watched the site-assessment video on a number of occasions and I can not see any conclusive evidence that any object or item had been in situ for a long time. There is evidence of ""poor housekeeping"" but, given the Accused's background, what Alan Douglas and his assistants were doing in the shed and the fact that it is a shed with a dirt floor, one could not expect much else. 
Count 4
88This count charges the possession of 79.26 grams of pseudoephedrine, a precursor intended by him for use in the manufacture by him of a prohibited drug, namely MA. There are two elements of this offence:
(i)the Accused had in his possession a precursor, and
(ii)he intended to use this precursor in the manufacture or production by him or another person, of a prohibited drug.
I am prepared to accept the Accused's evidence that he found the bag of and box of proprietary medicines in his kitchen on the evening of 26 November 2008. I accept that they were brought there by Alan Douglas or one or more of his assistants. The bag and box may originally have been in the shed. However the Accused took possession of them when he picked them up and moved them to his bedroom and sought to hide them there. The asportation of the bag and box and their secretion in another part of the Accused's house amount, in law, to his taking possession of them. The first element is established beyond reasonable doubt. 
89The evidence to support the second element is, if there actually be any, extremely tenuous. I have already quoted part of the following evidence given in cross-examination but the extent of the cross-examination of the Accused on this issue is: 
Q. Where were the bags of white tablets before you put them in the bedroom?A. On the kitchen bench.
Q. Just sitting on the kitchen bench?A. Yes. There was a bag and a box and I had them in my hand when Lisa turned up and, like, I was actually walking over toward the door, you know what I mean, and that's when I went to the bedroom and I thought I threw them in my bedroom drawer.
Q. Did you put any under the bed?A. I don't think so, no. I don't know.
Q. Did you put any in a drawer?A. That's what I just said, in the bedroom drawer, yeah. That's where I thought they actually all went. Possibly could have dropped it, I don't know.
Q. Why did you hide those tablets?A. Because I didn't want Lisa to see them.
Q. You didn't want Lisa to see the tablets?A. No, I didn't want her to see anything, that's why I moved the stuff out of the direct kitchen and that, you know what I mean. And it was just a spur of the moment thing. Like it wasn't something I planned to put them in the bedroom drawer or nothing.
A little later the Accused said that he kept ""what they'd done ... on the bench"" because he was expecting ""them"" to return. He went of to say this:
""I didn't think I was going to get away with it that easily. I was half scattered ... I'd been on drugs, and I ... wasn't thinking that I was going to get away with it.""
I have already pointed to other evidence given by the Accused of his expecting Alan Douglas, at least, to return. The Accused took the tablets and sought to hide them from Ms Bullock, not from Alan Douglas. He would know that he left them with the Accused and would no doubt return to claim his property, obviously including the tablets used as a prime ingredient in the manufacture of MA. Seeking to hide the tablets from Alan Douglas and converting them to the Accused's own use could have brought dire consequences from either Douglas or his biker acquaintances. The only intention that I can discern from the evidence is that the Accused intended to give the tablets back to Alan Douglas on demand. The second element of this offence has not been made out on any standard of proof. 
90I suspect that it could be argued (but it was not) that the Accused ""knew"" that Alan Douglas would use the tablets in the manufacture of MA. However, such ""knowledge"" is merely a deep or strong suspicion. The Act requires the Accused to have the requisite intention. Intention must be distinguished from something such as ""belief on reasonable grounds"" that another might or would use the precursor to manufacture the prohibited drug. 
Count 5
91This count charges that the Accused supplied ketamine in an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity of that drug. The commercial quantity of that drug is 1.25 kilograms. Item D04 (a brown cardboard box with yellow DHL tape), which was found on the dirt floor of the shed at Grose Wold contained 1.718 kilograms of ketamine with a purity of less than 1%. The purity of the drug is irrelevant in State offences. Small amounts of ketamine were also found in the kitchen of the Accused's house. The commercial quantity of the drug has been established beyond reasonable doubt.
92""Supply"" is defined in s 3 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 thus:
""supply"" includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.
Section 29 of the same Act is this:
29 Traffickable quantity-possession taken to be for supply A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply, unless: 
(a) the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply, or 
(b) except where the prohibited drug is prepared opium, cannabis leaf, cannabis oil, cannabis resin, heroin or 6-monoacetylmorphine or any other acetylated derivatives of morphine, the person proves that he or she obtained possession of the prohibited drug on and in accordance with the prescription of a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner, midwife practitioner, dentist or veterinary practitioner.
The traffickable quantity of ketamine is 7.5 grams, so the commercial quantity of the drug is a traffickable amount. Under section 29, the Crown is required to prove that the Accused had in his possession a quantity of the drug in excess of the traffickable quantity. The Accused is then liable to be convicted of supplying the drug contrary to s 25 of the Act unless the Accused proves either of the circumstances provided by paragraphs (a) or (b) of s 29. The allegation is, in essence, of ""deemed supply"". 
93In DPP v Brooks [1974] AC 862; [1974] 2 All ER 840, Lord Diplock, delivering the advice of the Privy Council in an appeal from the Court of Appeal of Jamaica, said this: 
""In the ordinary use of the word 'possession', one has in one's possession whatever is, to one's knowledge, physically in one's custody or one's physical control"" (All ER at 842h).""
This dictum was cited with approval in He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1985) 157 CLR 523 by Gibbs CJ (at 537), by Brennan J (at 586) and by Dawson J (at 600). Mason J (as he then was) concurred with the Chief Justice. Did the Accused know that there was ketamine at his property? In his evidence-in-chief the Accused said this:
Q. There was also discovered a chemical by the name of ketamine. Are you able to tell us how that arrived or how it got to Grose Wold?A. It obviously come in the back of the ute.
Q. Did you ever handle any of that material?A. Ketamine?
Q. Yes.A. No. I wouldn't even know what it looked like.
The Accused was cross-examined about the box (D04) at T411 and again denied that he had seen the box containing ""that brown powder"" before the arrival of Alan Douglas in his utility truck on 21 November 2008. He was then cross-examined about bags of substances found in the kitchen, one of which bags (item A43) contained 1.23 grams of ketamine. Another bag (without a chemical operations identifier, item 6 referred to in the DAL certificate of 25 March 2009) also contained 0.27g of ketamine. Photo no. 6 in the general photos taken at Grose Wold behind pink tab 2 in that part of exhibit A relating to Grose Wold is a photograph of this last item. The Accused freely admitted that he owned small bags of MA found in his kitchen - he was an addict and these were for his personal use. Mr Crown then turned to the photograph of the small bag of ketamine:
Q. The small plastic bag, photo 6, on the window sill.A. Yes.
Q. It contained a small amount of ketamine.A. No, it looks like meth to me.
Q. It looks like meth to you?A. Meth.
Q. Had you seen that bag before?A. Yeah.
Q. Was it yours?A. Possibly. Possibly. I don't know. But to be having ketamine, no.
Q. You say that ketamine was not a drug which you used yourself?A. No, it wouldn't be  no.
Q. But it was a drug that you used during part of some of your manufacturing process, wasn't it?A.  No.
The Accused then said that if a small bag contained amphetamine he suspected or accepted (""expected"") that it was his. This evidence was then given:
HIS HONOUR
Q. Does that mean if it's not amphetamine it's unlikely to be yours?A. Yeah, pretty much. Unless I've been duded.
Q. That does happen, doesn't it?A. Of course. More often than not.
The thrust of the Accused's evidence is that he knew nothing about the ketamine and I am prepared to accept that evidence, particularly when he freely admitted to the possession of the bags of MA found in his kitchen, and also the 0.86 grams of MA found in a small plastic cup (general photos, pink tab 2, no. 4, item 7 in DAL certificate of 25 March 2009). Accordingly I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had knowledge of the ketamine, sufficient to establish ""possession"" of that drug. 
Counts 6, 6A, 7 and 7A
94At [47] above I found beyond reasonable doubt that a commercial quantity of MA had been manufactured at Leppington and at [51] I found beyond reasonable doubt that a large commercial quantity of MDMA had been manufactured at the same site. What evidence links the Accused to these manufactures? The evidence which might link the Accused can be summarised thus:(a)evidence of Daryl Galway;(b)welding a metal keg;(c)fingerprints;(d)lack of ""recent"" use of the Leppington shed; and(e)alleged admissions made by the Accused in the ERISP.
I shall consider each of these areas separately.
(a) Daryl Galway's evidence
95At [58] above I pointed out that I am unable to accept any of the evidence of Daryl Galway beyond reasonable doubt unless there be adequate corroboration. In his evidence-in-chief, Daryl said that he went to the chicken shed and he noticed some boxes. He had to move them to get one of his cars out of the shed. He then said, ""the bottoms of the boxes were wet and when I moved it [sic] a fair bit of glassware fell out"". It is unclear to me whether his use of the singular, neuter pronoun is a mistake for use of the plural or whether glassware fell out of one box only. When asked what sort of glassware he meant he said ""condensers, bowls"" (the latter word has been incorrectly transcribed as 'bulbs'), ""as glassware to manufacture, to cook"" prohibited drugs. Daryl had not placed that glassware there and did not ""see"" how it came to be there. He had seen the Accused at the shed on several occasions and had seen him moving furniture and ""boxes and stuff like that"" on different occasions (T74) and also cars (T76.32). He then gave evidence about the smell he noticed at Leppington when the Accused may or may not have been there but where his car was at least once, that I quoted in [57] above. A little later Daryl gave this evidence:
Q. Did you have a conversation with Les asking him to take equipment out of the shed?A. To remove the stuff from the premises 'cause I didn't want to know about it because it would have involved me again.
HIS HONOUR
Q. What stuff was that?A. Just the stuff that I had seen when I was moving the car out of the shed.
Q. What, the glassware you mean?A. Glassware and these  
CROWN PROSECUTOR
Q. These? Sorry, if you could just finish?A. These containers, vats or whatever you want to call them.
Q. Did Les say anything to you when you made that request?A. No, he didn't. Whether he was thinking to say something or completely forgot about it or what, I don't, I don't know.
The conversation is an odd one, where the person spoken to says nothing. I find it hard to accept that the Accused said nothing.
96Daryl then said that at Leppington he saw Alan Douglas and Dave, and they were with the Accused ""on one or two occasions"". He saw Alan Douglas ""a few times"" at Leppington. He had known Alan Douglas since Christmas 1999 or Christmas 2000. When the Accused was in custody at Bathurst gaol, Daryl visited him. Daryl recalled a question about the Leppington shed and the Accused is alleged to have replied that, ""I'll worry about it later.""
97In cross-examination Daryl admitted that when he was interviewed by police on 4 June 2009, immediately after his arrest, he said his discovery of the chemical apparatus occurred 6 months earlier. He told police, "" I seen stuff in the shed but I just turned around and just walked straight back out and locked it."" Of course, 6 months before 4 June 2009 would be early December 2008 i.e. after the Accused's arrest. This evidence was then given: 
Q. So is the position this: there was only ever one occasion that you saw this equipment, these items of apparatus that you've told us about, one occasion; namely, six months before this interview you had with police in June 2009. Right?A. (No verbal reply)
Q. You have to say yes, it's being recorded.A. Yes.
Q. Can I suggest this to you, that you merely assumed when you saw those items, that Les had put them there, you never saw Les put the items in the shed, did you?A. No, I didn't, I did not physically see him put them in the shed.
Q. Isn't the position this, you saw them and you just assumed that Les had put those items there?A. Yes, I assumed.
Q. Didn't you also assume that the person you described to the police in the interview of June 2009, as Al, didn't you also assume that Al was responsible for some of those items?A. Yes.
Q. You said  if you go to page 19 of the interview, at question 256, you were asked the question, ""So how do you think these items that caused you to walk out of the shed come to be in there?""  And you answered, ""Well, I assume that my brother Les and one of his mates, Al, put them there.""  Then you went on to describe the person Al, whom you've referred to in your evidence?A. Yes.
At T94 Daryl said he had seen Alan at Leppington on several occasions and in answer to the very next question he said that he had only seen him by himself, i.e. not with either Dave or the Accused. I shall not recite again his evidence about smells which I discussed in some detail between [56] and [58] above, where I pointed out that I have no confidence whatever in his reliability on that area of evidence. 
98The only corroboration for any of this evidence is the evidence of the Accused, about Daryl's approach to him at least a month before and more likely two months before 27 November 2011 which I recited at [60] above. I find the Accused's evidence in that regard more plausible than the evidence of Daryl. 
(b) Welding a metal keg
99Daryl Galway said that there was an occasion when he saw some light at the shed and heard some sound coming from it. He went to the shed and saw the Accused ""welding up a steel pipe"" (T77.27) that was 8 to 10 feet long and about 8 inches in circumference. He was taken later by Mr Crown to the photograph of item E09 (a steel beer keg, converted to an improvised reaction vessel) and said, ""All I seen Les doing was welding that bit of pipe into that container, that's all I seen."" He agreed that the item was a beer keg. The piece of pipe welded onto the keg appears to me to be about 6 inches long, at longest no more than 12 inches, a foot. Neither the keg or the pipe, or the two combined measure the description initially provided by Daryl.
100The Accused gave this evidence about welding a keg:
Q. Now you've also heard evidence, I think, from your brother where he described, I think, he saw you welding up a keg or something.A. Yep.
Q. Remember that evidence? Can you tell us about that?A. Well I was over at my St Marys yard, like wood yard, and there was   Alan had a factory unit in the same like - well I had the wood yard next door and then there was probably eight or ten units. Now Alan and others had shared units there. Now they were making biodiesel there. Now he brought this keg to me, right, and asked me could I repair it, right.  And that's what I was doing at Leppington. Like I was actually doing the repair on the keg.
Q. When you say repair what sort of repair?A. Like up around the top there's like a neck thing on it, right, and there was   it was leaking around that neck, right, and I just welded that neck part.
Q. Did Alan ask you to do that?A. Yes.
Q. What were the background circumstances to him inviting you to fix this keg up?A. I'm not sure what you mean.
Q. Well was there some particular conversation you had with him about what he was using that keg for?A. Yeah, yeah. Like I'd already seen what they were doing with it. They were making biodiesel from like old cooking oil and stuff like that.
Q. But when was that?  When did you see that?A. In the St Mary's yard, like this is before anything even got found over there, you know what I mean.  Like it was ages before.
Q. I think the evidence was that there was one of these kegs also at Grose Wold?A. Yes.
Q. Can you tell us how that  A. It was on the back of the ute. That come on the back of the ute. It was around about that time well actually yes, it was about that time, right, that I'd sort of known that these kegs weren't for the realistically making the biodiesel, you know what I mean, like.
Q. But had you worked on one keg or two kegs for Alan?A. Just one. Just one. Only repaired it, that was it.
Q. So the keg at Grose Wold your evidence is that came on the  A. On the ute, yeah.
Q. With the other  A. Yeah.
Q. The other material?A. Yep.
HIS HONOUR
Q. Did you repair the keg for Alan at St Mary's or  A. No, no, at Leppington, that's where my welder and all that was.
Cross-examination on this issue was limited to this:
Q. E9 is a photograph of a keg - it's a keg which your brother Daryl pointed out as being the one he thought that he saw you welding at Leppington?A. That's not the one.
Q. That's not the one? Do you say that it is the one that we looked at yesterday from Grose Wold?A. No. The one I remember welding, right  is very similar to the one in E10 but it had a yellow band on it.
Q. So E10?A. It had a ... yellow stripe in.
Q. Would you say this: to the extent that there are kegs at Leppington similar to the one at Grose Wold, to the extent that there are blue tubs with black lids at Leppington similar to the ones at Grose Wold ... to the extent that there are items of scientific equipment, glassware and the like, at Leppington similar to what police found at Grose Wold they are in both those locations because of Alan Douglas, not because of you?A. Correct.
E10 is a more modern keg than E09 but does not have a yellow stripe on it, rather a blue stripe and a red stripe.
101All I can find from this evidence is that at some time the Accused welded a keg in the chicken shed at Leppington for Alan Douglas, the welding being done there because the Accused's welding equipment was stored there. The Accused said that at that time he believed Alan Douglas required the welding to be done for the purposes of that man's bio-diesel business. There is no other evidence about the existence of such a business, but the Accused was not challenged in that regard. This is not proof of the involvement of the Accused in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. 
(c) Fingerprints
102I have recited the Accused's evidence about his fingerprints at [71] above. The items on which his fingerprints were found are:
A16:A glass sintered funnel inside a 1 L glass pyrex jug.C38:2x800ml glass pyrex beakers containing a dark brown residue.A35:A 750ml glass bottle adapted as a separating funnel with a plastic neck and tap.D14:An empty 4 L methylated spirits bottle.
None of these items were subject to chemical analysis. The presence of the Accused's fingerprints raises grave suspicion. However grave suspicion is no substitute for proof beyond reasonable doubt. The Accused's fingerprints were found on 4 items out of 215 and from 3 different areas of the shed. The Accused's touching items looking for drugs does not explain his prints, in my view, on items C38, A35 and D14. However, the Accused does admit entering the shed and seeing the clandestine laboratory and he could well have touched many things in passing. I have, somewhat reluctantly, concluded that the Accused's evidence about his fingerprints might reasonably be true and therefore raises a reasonable doubt. 
(d) Lack of ""recent"" use of the shed
103This was a submission put to me by the Crown. However, there is no actual evidence as to when the laboratory was last used. The Crown submitted that because the Accused was in custody between 27 November 2008 and 11 May 2009 and because there is no evidence of the Accused's going there between 11 May 2009 and the execution of the search warrant on 20 May 2009, the Accused was the operator of the laboratory. However, assuming the laboratory had not been recently operated, how am I, as the tribunal of fact, to know whether it was last operated one month, two months, three months, four months, five months or six months before 20 May 2009? How am I to know whether the cessation of operation of the laboratory was due to the illness of and undoubted death of Alan Douglas during this period? I can attach no weight whatever to this submission. 
(e) Alleged admissions made in the ERISP
104In question 94, the Accused was asked when he was last in the shed at Leppington. The interview continued thus: 
A. Oh, God, I've honestly got no idea, um---Q. O.K.
A. Prior, prior to the Grose Wold thing, you know, I went through a shit, a load of shit with Alison, right, and that's when like I ... You know what I mean? Like, um basically she took me, me girls and fucking there's me life, you know what I mean? So I thought ---Q. Yeah.
A. ... I thought all right, nothing to lose so fucking bang and that's when I fell into the trap with the other shit, you know.Q. Yeah. O.K. All right. So we're going to, we probably can't establish when you last went into the shed at Leppington. Can you tell me what other things you've seen in the shed?
A. I'd rather not.Q. O.K.
A. At this point in time.
The Accused explained this in cross-examination:
Q. At question 95 you told the police about that, didn't you? That prior to the Grose Wold thing, you went through a load of shit with Alison?A. Yep.
Q. She took the girls, and as you say, ""Well, there's my life you know what I mean?""?A. Yep.
Q. ""So I thought, 'all right; nothing to lose; so fucking bang, and that's when I fell into the trap with the other shit, you know'""?A. Yep.
Q. You were talking about the period in your life when you fell into the trap of being involved, through Alan Douglas.  A.  No.
Q. ...in drug manufacturing, weren't you?A. No, I meant getting on drugs back on drugs. That's when it all started, like, when I got back on the drugs.
I am prepared to accept as a reasonably available interpretation of ""I fell into the trap with the other shit"" as being a relapse by the Accused to drug use. However the next questions asked by the Crown and the answers given are:
Q. Because if you go over the page?A. Yep.
Q. And at 99, you told the police officer this:
'But you know the worst part about that - every time I've been hit they always give me enough to fucking do it again. So you know, I can't just turn to you and say, ""Man youse left this all right"", because it would be 'Yeah, sure you know.'  And it would be my luck on the way there I'd get my arse nailed.  So catch 22, you know.'?
A. What I was referring to by that, was that when I did get out of gaol from, like, the Grose Wold raid, right? There was numerous items that the police had left behind, right? And again, when they done the Leppington raid they left a heap of shit behind then. Now, this ... interview ...  is after the Leppington raid, and like some years after, right? And that's   ... what I was referring to there.
I am also prepared to accept that in A99 the Accused was referring to items left behind by police after the execution of the search warrants on 27 November 2008 and 20 May 2009. The Crown did not seek to establish that, for example, the Accused was connected in someway with some other clandestine drug laboratory (e.g. Daryl's, which lead to his arrest in 2002) and that the police left behind sufficient equipment to enable the Accused to set up the clandestine drug laboratories, or one of them, discovered at Leppington and Grose Wold. 
105After the answer last quoted by Mr Crown, the ERISP continued thus:
Q. So what do you mean do it again?A. Well, manufacturing, you know what I mean, like um---
Q. So are you saying there's always been gear left around and they enable you to do things?A. Yeah, well, it just doesn't enable, it entices, you know what I mean? Like whenever you talk about be tough or whatever and it always seem at the time you're approached by the right people and...
Q. Yeah.A. You know.
Q. Yeah O.K All right. But you see that the police hadn't to my knowledge ever been to Leppington before --- A. No, no, no. 
Q. --- so I can't say there's been anything that the police may have left behind, if there was a lab there and they took it and all the stuff gone so ---A. But understand I didn't want it at me house either. You know what I mean? Like bits and pieces.
In my view it is permissible to regard this as referring to pressure being exerted e.g. by someone like Alan Douglas or his biker associates, to manufacture prohibited drugs using material left behind after a ""police raid"".
106The Accused was then asked about who may have been using the shed at Leppington and the Accused said that it was he and three others: one obviously is Daryl, it is now known that another was Alan Douglas but the identity of the third person has not been disclosed (at least, to me). He went on to point out that he used the shed to store things and as a yard for his firewood and his firewood business caused him to be there Monday to Friday, (sometimes) between 6am and 10pm. The interview continued: 
A. All right. And then, all right, that's when the old fellow approached and blah, blah, blah and well, anything for a quid, you know, and then um, like um, yeah, I don't know, I don't know.
Q135. It's all, yeah.A. Yeah, I'll just stop it there because like ---
Q136. O.K.A. Mmm.
When confronted with that answer (A134), the Accused gave this evidence:
Q. The answer to the question we see it there at 134  about three quarters of the way down page 15? You said this: ""And then all right  but that's when the old fella approached and blah, blah, blah  and well, anything for a quid, you know?  And then I'm like 'Yeah, I don't know, I don't know.'""  You were talking about, first of all, Alan Douglas there the old fellow, weren't you?A. Obviously, yep.
Q. And when he approached you, he approached you at that point to be involved in drug manufacturing, didn't he?A. No, it was to repair the keg.
Q. ""Anything for a quid, you know.""?A. That's right.
Q. You were telling the police about Leppington, and what was happening at Leppington?A. No, like ... that interview, like, I ... would just put it straight out now, all right.  I ... was off my head. I was scattered out, all right? And it made me sick to watch it, right? And the two years I've spent in gaol, all right, has made me realize how much of an idiot I've been in my past. And like, I can tell you know, what I meant there was ""for a quid"" was he paid me to repair that keg.
The Accused said on a number of other occasions, in essence, that he did not know what he was saying in the interview and that his mind was drug-addled: e.g. T359.30, T361.06 (where the Accused described himself as a ""drug-fucked idiot""), T425.49, and T426.45 (where he said, ""To sit down and watch something like that ... was the biggest kick in the guts I've ever had in my life"" - a masterpiece of hyperbole). 
107I am unable to accept the evidence I have last quoted and the protestations I have just summarised. In my ruling of 2 October 2013 I canvassed the admissibility of the ERISP. At [31] of that ruling I said this:
""Having observed the recorded interview and read it a number of times, I see no danger of confabulation.  I do not find any lack of awareness on the part of the Accused. I cannot determine any lack of capacity to make rational decisions, between speaking and remaining silent, especially where the Accused's rights were repeatedly drawn to his attention, and I cannot see any irrational answers.""
In my ruling of 9 October 2013 I said this:
6. For the purposes of today's ruling I have again, in open Court, re played exhibit T, the edited electronically recorded interview.  It appeared to me that the observation I made on p 279 to which I have just referred was correct.  The Accused's somatic language indicated to me some agitation consistent with affectation by some substance such as an illicit drug or alcohol or both.  However, in the earlier ruling I pointed out that there was nothing in the answers given by the accused in the interview to suggest that they were other than reliable.  Indeed when I replayed exhibit T, it became clear to me that the Accused's language, grammar and syntax in the interview were almost the same as his language, syntax and grammar in the witness box.
7.The Accused's body may have been affected by his drug consumption on 27 October 2011 but there is nothing to suggest in the electronically recorded interview that his psyche was adversely affected and that is confirmed by the answers he gave in the interview itself to both Detective Senior Constable Reay, to Detective Senior Constable Bashford and to the confirming, independent officer, Sergeant O'Donoghue.
The Accused's assertion that ""anything for a quid"" is explained by his repairing a beer keg for a reward is so implausible as to be ridiculous. 
108However, ""anything for a quid"" is very vague. The Crown argues that the only plausible explanation is that the Accused was admitting to manufacturing prohibited drugs. That, in my view of this case, is not the only plausible explanation. Another equally plausible explanation is the Accused's permitting Alan Douglas to use the shed, or telling him about it or introducing Douglas to Daryl. The Accused said in evidence that he did not give a key to the shed to Douglas (T419.42), he assumed Daryl must have done so, but there is no evidence from Daryl about this aspect of the case. A79 of the ERISP suggests that an XG1 Torana owned by Alan Douglas was in the shed. Douglas may have originally used the shed for some legitimate purpose but subsequently used it for the illegitimate purpose of a clandestine drug laboratory. Another consideration is that the Accused was initially paying rent for the shed, but when his firewood business was failing and there were the relationship difficulties with his former partner, Ms Allison Mudford, money could have become a scarce commodity and an offer to pay the rent for the shed from Douglas may have been welcome. There is clearly more than one plausible explanation for ""anything for a quid."" The fact that I reject the Accused's explanation does not mean that I must adopt the explanation argued by the Crown. The Accused is entitled to the benefit of any reasonable doubt and I have reasonable doubts about the meaning of ""anything for a quid."" 
109Of course one must ask why the Accused told what can only be described as a lie to explain the meaning of ""anything for a quid"" when there is another, more plausible explanation. The answer could well be that the Accused was afraid that he might inculpate himself, bearing in mind the extended definition of ""take part in"" in s 6 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. However, the Crown did not rely on, for example, the Accused's letting or sub-letting the chicken shed at Leppington to another, perhaps Alan Douglas, and permitting or suffering that person to manufacture prohibited drugs. The Crown case was based on the Accused's actually manufacturing prohibited drugs: see T420.37 to T420.50, T425.36, T429.08. In the lead up to the last question I to which I have just referred, Mr Crown put this question:
Q: He [Alan Douglas] had access to the Leppington shed through you and your key didn't he? 
to which the Accused responded in the negative. Later (at T435.19) the Accused said that he, Daryl and Alan Douglas had keys to the shed and he knew not who else might have a key. If the Crown case were based on the Accused's sub-letting the chicken shed to Alan Douglas and permitting him or suffering him to manufacture prohibited drugs then that was not been established beyond reasonable doubt either. The Accused's evidence is that he did not give a key to Douglas who had one and no evidence about keys was given by Daryl Galway other than that he gave a key to the Accused. The Crown did not seek to establish the payment of any rent or the like by a third party to the Accused. There was no cross-examination of him about any economic matters nor evidence of economic matters, other than of the cash found at Grose Wold. 
110Another deficiency in the Crown case is that no attempt was made to implicate the Accused in the manufacture of MA and also the manufacture of MDMA. The Crown case was that the Accused was implicated in the clandestine laboratory and that both MA and MDMA were manufactured there, ergo the Accused was implicated in both the manufacture of MA and MDMA. That involves a non-sequitur: the Accused could have involved himself in the manufacture of one drug but not of the other. The Accused was a user of amphetamine so one could argue that he would have involved himself in the manufacture of MA but there is no evidence that the Accused used MDMA. It might be otherwise if, for example, the Accused's fingerprints were found on vessels involved in the manufacture of MA and also on vessels involved in the manufacture of MDMA, but there was, as I pointed out at [102] above no chemical testing of the four items on which the Accused's fingerprints were found. 
111Finally I ought to say that no consideration of the five different grounds relied upon by the Crown to support the Leppington charges, considered collectively, persuades me beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt of those charges.

		07 February 2014",2014-01-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705592,R v Lee [2013] NSWDC 232,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: What led to the offender Yonguk Lee committing a most serious offence, indeed an offence so serious it carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, were a number of factors which were highly interrelated. At the time of this offence he was using excessive amount of cannabis, he was depressed, short of money and had a poor relationship with his mother. It was in those circumstances that be took the opportunity that was presented to him to make $1,000 by accepting delivery of a package which he suspected, to the point of belief, contained drugs. 

2The matter came to the attention of the authorities earlier this year. On 9 February 2013 Customs intercepted a package which had been posted from China. It was to be delivered to the offender using a false name. Customs examined the package and discovered inside almost a kilogram of a crystalline substance which when further analysed proved to contain methylamphetamine. After analysing the purity of the substance it was possible to calculate the quantity of pure methamphetamine in the package as being 792.3 grams. To put that into context the commercial quantity of that drug is 750 grams. So Mr Lee is just in that category of offending which leads to a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. 

3Customs removed the drugs and substituted an inert substance. Police then began to intercept the offender's telephone. Over the next few days they overheard a number of conversations between the offender and others in which it was clear that the offender's role in this enterprise was to receive the package. Eventually an AFP officer purporting to be a TNT courier rang the offender and arranged for the package to be delivered to him. On 14 February that package was delivered to the offender pursuant to an arrangement that had been made between the offender and the AFP officer who was pretending of course to be a courier. The offender accepted delivery of the package. He was arrested soon afterwards. 

4In an interview the offender had with police that day he told them that he got involved in this enterprise for a friend. ""Harry Pi"" offered him an easy job to collect the package in exchange for payment of $1,000. Although the offender clearly accepted the high probability that the package contained drugs, he decided to go ahead and accept the offer because of the financial reward.

5In sentencing the offender it is important to have regard of course to the criminality of his actions, to pay regard to what the offender did. What he did was to agree with Harry to collect the package, to discuss with Harry over the telephone the delivery of the package, to wait for its delivery, to collect and sign for it using a false name and allow his home to be used as a place of storage for the package. Clearly the offender played an important role. Those who wanted to get their hands on the drugs so that they could be distributed needed someone to collect the package and it was this role that the offender played. 

6He was only nineteen years at the time of this offence and, it seems, somewhat of an impulsive young man. He was born in Korea and came to Australia at the age of six. There was not a lot of money around in the family home and he took his parent's separation to heart. At one stage he returned to Korea with his father but lived more often with his mother. 

7I mentioned before the interrelationship of cannabis use, depression, lack of money and the offender's relationship with his mother. The interrelationship of those factors is of course obvious and they led to a situation where the offender, having moved out of home, having been using cannabis for a long time, having been depressed, having been short of money, accepted the offer made to him by Harry because of the financial reward it would bring. 

8The offender's life has not been an easy one. A very helpful account of it is given in a reference from a man who has known the offender and his family for some time, Mr Bruce Rownsley. He is married to a woman who was born in Korea and he thus has had close contact with many people of Korean origin in the Strathfield, Homebush and Belmore areas of Sydney, including the offender and his family. He summarises the offender's situation in these terms. Poor family, abusive and uninterested father and stepfather, unpleasant home life because of his mother's two broken marriages. He was overweight, had poor academic ability, was bullied at school, depressed emotional state, low self esteem, dependant on others and easily led. 

9Not everyone can respond to an offer to make money such as was made to the offender by Harry with the same sense of mature consideration. The offender, being only nineteen years old at the time and having the background that Mr Rownsley summarises, was less able than most to reason about the appropriateness of accepting Harry's proposal. That is a significant matter when it comes to assessing the moral culpability of the offender's conduct. 

10The offender pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity and has thus expressed a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. He also spoke to the authorities and gave them what he thought was some assistance in identifying others involved in the importation of drugs. Although the information has turned out to be of little value to police, the fact that the offender offered it in the first place tends to support other evidence indicating the offender's remorse at what he has done. Taking into account the offender's willingness to facilitate the course of justice by pleading guilty and a small discount for assisting the authorities the sentence I will impose upon Mr Lee is approximately 30 per cent less than it would otherwise have been. 

11A submission was made to me that it would be appropriate to grant bail to Mr Lee so that he could enter the William Booth drug rehabilitation program. However the law is clear, s 11 remands should be exceedingly rare where it is inevitable that full-time custody would be imposed even if substantial rehabilitation were demonstrated. For that reason I do not propose to accede to the submission that a s 11 remand should be granted. 

12I am prepared to proceed on the basis that the offender does have good prospects of rehabilitation. The change in his behaviour in particular as a result of him no longer using cannabis since he went into custody bodes well for the future. Also the sentence that I must necessarily impose upon the offender will play a substantial part in personally deterring him from future offending, at least of the seriousness of this offence, because it remains the case that the offender's conduct was seriously wrong. He was part of a scheme to gain possession of a large quantity of drugs which had been imported into Australia. Had those drugs been distributed a lot of people would have suffered. The problems of drug use and drug addiction extend far beyond the misery caused to those who are addicted to drugs. Anyone who has spent even a short time in any criminal court in this State would know the contribution that drug use and drug addiction has to the commission of a significant proportion of crimes dealt with on a daily basis. What Mr Lee did was seriously wrong and he must be punished accordingly. 

13I have been assisted by submissions as regards other cases where people have been sentenced for offences of this type. Of course no two cases are the same and so I have taken into account those differences in assessing the sentence that I will impose upon Mr Lee, but the cases have been helpful in ensuring that the sentence I am about to impose on him is broadly consistent with the attitude taken by other judicial officers to offences of this kind.

14The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years, to date from 14 February 2013. It will expire on 13 August 2015 on which day the offender is to be released to parole. I set a head sentence of five years. 

15Mr Lee I need to explain to you the sentence I have just imposed upon you. It dates from the day you went into custody, the day you were arrested. You must serve two and a half years in gaol which means that the earliest you can be released is 13 August 2015. Whether you are released then or not is not up to me, it is up to the parole authorities. 

16Once you are released you will continue serving your sentence in the community to 13 February 2018. You will be on parole in the community and if you commit other offences or do not comply with the conditions of your parole you can be returned back into custody. Understand that. If you have any questions I am sure Ms Levick will see you downstairs and discuss the matter with you.

2705625,RD v R [2013] NSWCCA 306,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offences and sentenceOn 9 March 2012, which was the morning on which his trial was due to start, the applicant pleaded guilty to three offences of aggravated robbery with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s97(2) Crimes Act 1900.  When being sentenced in respect of count 2 the applicant asked that two further robberies committed with a dangerous weapon, contrary to s97(2) Crimes Act be taken into account in accordance with s32 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The maximum sentence for each offence is imprisonment for 25 years.  There is no standard non-parole period.
2The applicant was sentenced by Charteris SC DCJ as follows:
Count 1 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 1 February 2011 and expiring 31 January 2015, with a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months, expiring 30 April 2018.
Count 3 - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 1 August 2012 and expiring 31 July 2016, with a balance of term of 3 years and 3 months, expiring 31 October 2019.
Count 2 - (taking into account the matters on the Form 1) - Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months, commencing 1 November 2013 and expiring 31 January 2018, with a balance of term of 4 years and 3 months, expiring 30 April 2022.
3The overall sentence was one of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and a balance of term of 4 years and 3 months.  
4The applicant seeks leave to appeal on a single ground of appeal as follows:
Ground 1 - His Honour erred in treating the fact that the offences were committed in company as an aggravating factor.
Factual background
5The first count on the indictment related to an armed robbery on 27 July 2010 at the Stella Inn at Tempe.  At 8.50pm, RD with an unknown accomplice entered the Stella Inn via a rear car-park.  RD was armed with a silver kitchen knife with a 15 cm blade.  He was disguised in a black balaclava.  The unknown accomplice was armed with a replica firearm.  He also was disguised in a black balaclava.  
6RD and the accomplice confronted staff in the kitchen and forced them along a corridor to the main bar area.  In that location, the applicant forced the staff and patrons of the hotel to the floor.  The applicant and his accomplice violently assaulted one of the patrons who refused to comply.  They struck him with a bottle and a chair and repeatedly kicked him as he fell to the floor.
7The offenders demanded money from staff and approximately $7000 was taken from cash registers.  The offenders fled in a Hyundai XL sedan, which had been stolen earlier in the day and was recovered by the police at Redfern on 14 August 2010.
8The second count on the indictment was an armed robbery at the Newington Inn at Petersham on 25 August 2010.  At about 10.05pm three males, who were armed with replica firearms and a baseball bat, entered the Newington Inn from the rear car-park.  They confronted staff and patrons.  One offender, who was armed with a shotgun, demanded cash from the registers and a safe.  The other offenders assembled the patrons and staff in the beer garden and the TAB.  A total of $4500 was stolen by the offenders, who then fled in a Toyota Corolla which had been stolen some 10 days earlier.
9All of the offenders were disguised with hooded jumpers, balaclavas, gloves and material covering their faces.  The applicant was the person who was armed with a baseball bat. 
10The next robbery was the first matter on the Form 1.  This was an armed robbery at the Royal Sheath Hotel at Burwood on 3 September 2010.  At 20 minutes past midnight, three males armed with a replica pistol, a sword and a baseball bat entered the hotel.  They confronted staff and patrons and demanded money from the registers and the safe.  A total of $3000 in cash was taken from the hotel, as well as a bag containing property belonging to a barman, which included a mobile phone.  Identification was also stolen.  The offenders fled in the stolen Toyota Corolla sedan referred to in relation to count 2.  As before, the offenders were disguised with hooded jumpers and material covering their faces.  The applicant was the one armed with a baseball bat.
11The second matter on the Form 1 was an armed robbery which occurred on 7 September 2010 at the Dan Murphy Liquor store at Alexandria.  At about 7.55pm on 7 September 2010 three males, who were armed with a replica silver handgun, a chain and a baseball bat entered Dan Murphy's.  They confronted staff and customers.  One of the offenders, who was armed with a replica handgun, chased an employee.  That employee ran in fear through the store and threw bottles of liquor at the robber who was pursuing him.  Another offender bashed the customer service counters with a baseball bat.  The third offender stood guard at the store entrance, swinging a chain around his head.
12The offenders stole $600 in cash.  All of the offenders were disguised with hooded jumpers, balaclavas and material covering their faces.  The applicant was the offender who was armed with the baseball bat.
13The third count on the indictment was an armed robbery at the Petersham Inn at Petersham on 14 September 2010.  At 10.10pm that day, four males armed with replica firearms and a baseball bat entered the Petersham Inn Hotel.  They confronted staff and patrons, assembled them together in the main bar and forced them onto the floor before stealing money from cash registers.
14The manager of the hotel was forced to go to the office where more money was stolen from the safe.  The proceeds of the robbery totalled $9000 and included two mobile phones.  As before, the offenders were disguised with balaclavas and hooded jackets.  This time they fled in a Nissan which had been stolen from Sydenham earlier that evening.  The applicant was the offender armed with the baseball bat.
15A series of telephone communications were intercepted which revealed that the applicant, together with other accomplices, met at an address in Surry Hills to plan the robbery.  Police subsequently executed a search warrant at that address.  Objects found in that search linked the applicant to the robberies.  He was arrested on 16 September 2010.
16His Honour regarded all of the offences as extremely serious because of the fear which was engendered in both staff and patrons and because of the violence which occurred on occasions.  His Honour said in relation to all of the offences:
""The aggravating circumstances in each of the offences allege the possession of dangerous weapons and the fact that the offender was in company with others.  I take that matter into account.""  (ROS 8.8)
17The applicant was born in 1993 and was aged between 17 years and 3 months and 17 years and 5 months at the time when the offences occurred.  The applicant's criminal record, even at that young age, was considerable.  He had convictions for stealing a car, stealing property in a dwelling house and in 2008 he was sentenced for robbery in company.  There were, in addition, convictions for breaking, entering and stealing.
18As well as these offences, when the applicant came into custody he was dealt with for other offences.  He received an 18 months sentence, with a 9 month non-parole period for the assault of a law enforcement officer not being a police officer.  That sentence commenced on 23 May 2011 and these sentences were backdated to 1 February 2011 to have regard to that period of custody.
19A pre-sentence report was before the sentencing judge.  This showed that the applicant had an extremely difficult childhood and upbringing.  He first came to the attention of Probation and Parole in January 2010.  The applicant's response to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service was unsatisfactory.  Not only did he fail to report when required, but he was engaged in further offending behaviour.
20The applicant was raised in Kempsey and Coffs Harbour.  He is of Aboriginal background.  His mother died when he was aged 11 as a result of a drug overdose.  Following his mother's death, he entered the care of the Department of Community Services and thereafter resided in refuges before being held in various juvenile detention centres.  His foster mother stated that the most stable period of his life was from the age of 15 to 18 when he was in juvenile detention.  Despite his unfortunate background, the applicant completed year 10.  His results at school show him to be quite intelligent.
21The applicant started smoking cannabis when he was aged 12.  By the age of 14 he was using 30 cones of cannabis a day.  He commenced using heroin at age 14 and that use escalated to smoking a gram of heroin every second day at a cost of $200.  Despite attending alcohol and drug counselling courses, he has continued to use illicit drugs.  The applicant said that when he committed the armed robberies, he was under the influence of heroin.
22From an early age the applicant used to abscond from his mother's care and then his grandmother's and aunt's care.  He was regularly exposed to domestic violence, alcohol and drug abuse.  Although he was assessed by DOCS as being intelligent and capable, he was also assessed as ""very vulnerable to being drawn into criminal and drug related behaviour"".  
23A matter of aggravation was that the applicant was subject to conditional liberty from a Children's Court bond at the time of the commission of the offences.  His Honour took that into account as a matter of aggravation.  His Honour also had regard to the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 with its emphasis on rehabilitation, rather than punishment and deterrence.
24His Honour rejected a submission that the applicant's offending was less serious because the weapons used were replica weapons.  His Honour noted that this would not have been known to the victims who would have been put in fear because of their belief that the weapons were real.
25Because of the limited nature of the appeal ground, I propose to set out his Honour's concluding remarks which together with the observation at [16] form the basis of the appeal.
""As regards the assessment of the criminality, Mr Edwards does not dispute that the offences themselves are very serious criminal conduct.  They fall within the very broad middle range of criminality that responds to this section of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  In my view it could be argued that each of the offences may be towards the upper range of that broad middle range.  I intend to sentence him on the basis that the criminality is in the broad middle range.  Mr Edwards did not dispute that it was within my discretion to allow a discount of ten per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty. 
The prosecution made submissions directing my attention to the need to impose individual penalties for what are three discrete offences.  I am asked to have regard of course to the Form 1 matters when I come to impose sentence on Count 2.
There is more than one aggravating circumstance in each of the offences; I take that into account.  I also take into account an unknown number of patrons who were placed in fear by the conduct of the offenders. The Crown does not dispute that the record of the offender does not qualify as an aggravating matter.  The Crown does not dispute a finding of special circumstances.  I take into account the fact that the offender was on conditional liberty at the time he committed the offences.  I note that there are two circumstances of aggravation pleaded in each of the matters, but only one matter is required at law.  I consider the offender does have good prospects of rehabilitation subject to his addressing his drug use.  I have had regard to his plea of guilty.  I have regard to his youth.""  (ROS 18.8 - 19.7)
Submissions and consideration
26The applicant submitted that s97 Crimes Act 1900 included as part of the foundational offence that the robbery occurred in company and that by referring to this factor as an aggravating feature, his Honour was in effect double counting.  This, it was submitted, amounted to error which required this Court to re-sentence.  The applicant submitted that in accordance with s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 another sentence was warranted at law and on re-sentence this Court would impose a lesser sentence.
27Section 97 provides:
""97 (1)  Whosoever, being armed with an offensive weapon, or instrument, or being in company with another person, 
robs, or assaults with intent to rob, any person ...
...
 shall be liable to imprisonment for twenty years.
(2)  Aggravated offence
A person is guilty of an offence under this subsection if the person commits an offence under subsection (1) when armed with a dangerous weapon. A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 25 years.
...""
28The applicant submitted that there is only one circumstance of aggravation provided for by s97, namely being armed with a dangerous weapon.  It was therefore wrong for his Honour to take into account that the offences were committed in company as a matter of aggravation.  On this issue, the applicant relied upon Hamze v R [2006] NSWCCA 36 which involved a similar ground of appeal.  There Giles JA (with whom Grove J and I agreed) said:
""36 The applicant submitted that, the charge including being in company, commission of the offence in company could not be taken into account as an aggravating factor.  The Crown submitted that commission in company was ""not strictly required for an offence under s 97(2)"", and that there was therefore no error in taking into account as an aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company.  The Crown further submitted that the offence was committed in company with three other men, that the presence of four men would have instilled greater fear in the victim than if there had been only two men and increased the risk of harm to the victim or a bystander, and that the judge should be taken to have had this in mind in his remarks. 
37 Section 97(2) builds upon s 97(1), and incorporates the commission of an offence under s 97(1).  The two limbs in s 97(1) can also be cumulative, and the applicant was charged with an offence with the two elements.  To repeat, the purpose of the limitation in s 21A(2) was to guard against double counting by increasing the offender's punishment because of something already taken into account by virtue of the conviction.  It would be an error in this case to take into account that the robbery was in company.  It would still be open to a sentencing judge, in assessing the seriousness of an offence, to conclude that the company of a number of men rather than a few increased the seriousness; this would depend on the facts ... .   But I am unable to conclude that the judge took this approach.  He did not explain, and I do not feel able to conclude from the apparent fact that he took into account the factor in par (e) only in relation to the offence charged in count 1, which had multiple companions, that he did more than have regard to the fact that the offence was committed in company as an aggravating factor.  In my opinion, there was error in this respect.""
29The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge fell into the same error.
30The respondent submitted that in the sentencing proceedings, the phrase ""aggravating feature"" was used rather loosely by counsel for the applicant.  In particular, he referred to the fact that the offences were committed ""in company"" as being ""an aggravating feature"".  In doing so, counsel for the applicant did not specifically refer to s21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  The respondent submitted that his Honour used the phrase ""aggravating circumstances"" at 8.8 and 19.5 ROS in the same imprecise way.  
31The respondent submitted that apart from the specific statutory use of the word ""aggravating"" in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act it did have other usages relevant to the criminal law.  The respondent submitted that one of those usages was as set out in s97(2) - an ""aggravated offence"".  The respondent submitted that another use of the word ""aggravated"" or its variants was in relation to the assessment of the seriousness of an offence for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, i.e., referring to a feature of the crime as an aggravating feature in the sense that it made the crime more serious than it otherwise might have been without an intention of concluding that the particular feature was caught by s21A(2).  The respondent submitted that his Honour used the word in that way and was not taking the ""in company"" feature into account so as to double count it.
32The respondent submitted that support for this proposition could be found in the way in which the sentencing judge described the offences as ""armed robberies in company"" and ""aggravated armed robbery"" elsewhere in his sentence remarks.  The respondent submitted that it was apparent from a consideration of the whole of the remarks on sentence, informed by the proceedings on sentence, that his Honour was referring to those features of the crime that constituted ""aggravated armed robbery"", i.e., ""being in company"" and ""the use of a dangerous weapon"" rather than two separate features of aggravation relevant to s21A of the Act.  The respondent submitted that this conclusion was supported by the way in which his Honour expressed himself in the two passages relied upon by the applicant.
33The respondent submitted that the ground of appeal was based on what could best be described as ""infelicities of expression"" in the sentencing judgment but that those ""infelicities"" did not amount to error and did not impermissibly inflate the sentences imposed.
34In the alternative, the respondent submitted that if error were disclosed, no lesser sentence was warranted in law when applying s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
35The respondent submitted that the only unqualified factors in the applicant's favour were his youth and his deprived background.  His prospects of rehabilitation were problematic and depended upon him abstaining from drug taking.  His criminal record was very bad.  Despite substantial periods of detention and attending rehabilitation programs, he had not been deterred from engaging in the very serious offences the subject of these proceedings.
36The seriousness of these offences emerges from the factual details.  In count 1, actual violence was administered to a non-compliant patron and in the second Form 1 matter, a staff member was pursued by an armed offender.  Except for count 1, each crime involved not just two armed and disguised offenders but a larger number.  The respondent noted that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of these offences and although entitled to be regarded as a minor was only 7 months short of his 18th birthday and was very much conducting himself as an adult.
37There is considerable force in the respondent's submission to the effect that on reading the whole of the remarks on sentence, his Honour was not double counting the ""in company"" feature of the offending by taking it into account pursuant to s21A (2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  His Honour appeared to be using the word ""aggravating"" in an ""infelicitous"" way to simply emphasise the seriousness of the totality of the offending.  I am not persuaded that his Honour did take the feature of being ""in company"" into account in the way in which the applicant asserts and that the ground of appeal has been made out.
38If I am incorrect in that conclusion, the facts of the offending are so serious as to inevitably lead to a conclusion that no lesser sentence is warranted in law.  This is so despite the applicant being aged 17 and coming from a very deprived background.  Not only were the offences of a very serious kind, but the structure of the sentences comprehended a significant degree of leniency.  Each offence was unrelated to the others and each offence was very serious.  It was only a generous application of the principles of totality which resulted in the degree of concurrence reflected by the sentences.  In allowing for this level of concurrence, the sentencing judge was clearly mindful of the applicant's youth and deprived background.
39The order which I propose is that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.
40BLANCH J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
41R A HULME J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

1WARD JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2HARRISON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

3R A HULME J: CM (""the applicant"") seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Maiden SC in the District Court at Newcastle on 26 October 2012.

4The applicant had pleaded guilty to a charge of armed robbery and had been found guilty at trial of two further armed robberies; a robbery; and an attempted robbery. 

5Armed robbery is an offence contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. Robbery is an offence against s 94 and the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. No standard non-parole period is prescribed for either offence.

6The judge imposed a total effective sentence of nine years with a minimum custodial component of seven years, dating from 20 October 2010. The applicant will become eligible for release on parole on 20 October 2017. The individual offences and sentences were as follows:

1. Robbery - Woolworths Liquor, Kotara on 5 April 2010: sentenced to three years with a non-parole period of two years dating from 20 October 2010.

2. Armed robbery - IGA store, Telarah on 6 April 2010: sentenced to four years with a non-parole period of three years dating from 20 October 2012.

3. Attempted robbery - Edgeworth Post Office, Edgeworth on 14 May 2010: sentenced to two years ten months with a non-parole period of two years dating from 20 October 2012.

4. Armed robbery - East Maitland Pharmacy on 14 May 2010: sentenced to six years with a non-parole period of four years dating from 20 October 2013.

5. Armed robbery - The General Roberts Hotel, New Lambton on 10 October 2010: sentenced to five years with a non-parole period of three years dating from 20 October 2014.

7A number of offences listed on Form 1 documents were taken into account in sentencing for the second, fourth and fifth matters. For the second and fourth matter there was a single offence taken into account in each case involving the theft of car number plates. In respect of the fifth matter the offences on the Form 1 comprised three instances of dishonestly obtaining property by deception and one further offence involving the theft of a car number plate.

8The applicant had undergone a trial in February 2012 before a different judge and a jury. He entered a plea of guilty to the offence which is the fifth matter listed above and the trial was discontinued. He underwent another trial before Maiden DCJ in June. He was acquitted of one matter but found guilty of the offences identified above as 1 - 4. 

9In sentencing the applicant in respect of the fifth offence of armed robbery at The General Roberts Hotel, the judge allowed a discount of five per cent for the applicant's late plea of guilty and a further twenty per cent for assistance provided to authorities. The starting point for that sentence would have been six years eight months.

10The proposed grounds of appeal assert error in (1) only applying the discount for assistance to charge five; (2) imposing a sentence on charge five that was manifestly excessive; (3) failing to give practical effect to a finding of special circumstances in the total effective sentence and imposing an effective total non-parole period in excess of the statutory ratio; and (4) imposing a total sentence and non-parole period that was manifestly excessive.

Facts

11The robbery of the Woolworths Liquor Store at Kotara on 5 April 2010 occurred at about 9.40am. The liquor store is located within a Westfield Shopping Centre. The applicant entered the centre via a loading dock and made his way to the liquor store. He was wearing a hat and glasses which served to conceal his appearance. He engaged the 25-year-old male shop attendant in a purported transaction but once the cash register drawer opened he demanded money. The shop attendant hesitated and the applicant replied, ""Do it. I want all the money. Do it, or I'll shoot you. I'll light the place up"". The shop attendant was said to have been ""very shocked"" by this and so co-operated by putting $310 from the till into a paper bag. The applicant then fled the store and left the shopping centre via the same loading dock. 

12On the following day the applicant drove his own vehicle but with a stolen number plate attached to it to the vicinity of the IGA supermarket in South Street, Telarah. The number plate had been stolen from a car earlier that morning in Maitland. 

13The applicant was wearing the same hat, glasses and clothing as he had worn the previous day. In addition he had a toy pistol stuck in the waistband of his jeans. 

14Shortly before noon he entered the IGA supermarket and made his way to a checkout register where he purported to engage in a small transaction. He then demanded that the 51 year old female attendant provide him some money from the till. He pulled up his T-shirt to reveal the ""gun"". He said, ""Just give me the money, remain calm and everything will be alright"". The attendant opened the cash register drawer and placed $1700 in cash into a shopping bag. The applicant then fled.

15On the morning of 14 May 2010, the applicant attached a stolen number plate to his car, which he then drove to the vicinity of the Edgeworth Post Office. Wearing a hat to cover his face he entered the Post Office carrying a blue cloth ""enviro"" supermarket bag. The 74-year-old male postmaster was alone. The applicant approached him, pushed the blue bag across the counter and said, ""money"". The postmaster hesitated a few seconds and the applicant lifted his shirt up and reached across to his side in a way that led the victim to think that he was going to produce a gun or some other type of weapon. However, the victim pushed the bag back across the counter to the applicant. The applicant said, ""Oh come on mate, fair go"", but grabbed the bag and then fled.

16Later that day the applicant went to the East Maitland Pharmacy. He was wearing the same cap to conceal his face as well as glasses. He had the toy pistol concealed under his T-shirt and tucked into the waistband of his jeans. He approached a 16-year-old female trainee at the counter. She asked if she could assist him and he replied, ""You're going to do something for me and it's going to be really quiet. You're going to open the till and give me all the cash or I'm going to shoot"". She baulked at this and he then lifted his T-shirt to display the handle of the apparent gun tucked into his pants and said, ""Open it, or I'll shoot you"". The young woman took the threat literally; she believed the gun was real and that she would be shot if she did not comply. Understandably, she became scared. She later suffered an asthma attack. 

17An assistant pharmacist emerged from the lunchroom and approached and asked if there was a problem. The applicant looked directly at her and said, ""Put it in the bag or I'll shoot you"". The trainee emptied the till of $910 and placed it in the applicant's blue bag. She was hyperventilating and then retreated to the lunchroom. The applicant grabbed the bag, ran out of the pharmacy and fled in his vehicle. 

18The stolen number plate attached to his vehicle had been stolen at Edgeworth on 23 April 2010. 

19On 20 October 2010, the applicant attended the drive through bottle shop at The General Roberts Hotel in New Lambton shortly before midday. He was wearing a cap and reading glasses to cover his face and had a toy pistol tucked into his waistband covered by his T-shirt. He approached the 22-year-old male attendant and demanded that he put money into a bag. The attendant queried whether he was serious and the applicant replied, ""Fuck oath, I'm serious"" and lifted up his shirt to reveal the apparent gun. The attendant thought it was real and co-operated. He opened the till and removed the $50 notes upon the applicant's demand. The applicant then said, ""Yeah that'll do"" and fled. The proceeds of this robbery were $150. 

20When sentencing for that offence the judge took into account a further offence of stealing a number plate. That number plate had been stolen on 16 April 2010 and was found in the boot of the applicant's car after his arrest. There were also three offences of dishonestly obtaining property by deception. These each concerned the applicant attending a service station in his own vehicle with a stolen number plate attached and leaving without paying for petrol or LPG.

21In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences the judge referred to there having been ""a significant amount of planning"", particularly given the theft of number plates and their use to disguise his own car. Earlier in his remarks he alluded to the modification of the appearance of the toy gun to make it look real. The judge also referred to the wearing of a cap or hat and glasses and that the applicant appeared to keep his head down so that his face could not be seen by CCTV cameras. In relation to the pharmacy robbery, the judge also referred to CCTV footage which showed the applicant driving past on a number of occasions apparently checking for an appropriate time to enter the store. Also in relation to that offence, one of the victims was pregnant at the time and ""suffered great distress"" as a result.

Other matters relevant to sentence

22The judge referred to the applicant being 50 years of age at the time of sentence. He noted that the offences were committed because the applicant was in need of money. The applicant had the support of his mother upon his eventual release into the community. The judge also noted that the applicant had been involved in unpaid community work prior to his arrest. A former employer spoke highly of the applicant in a reference. 

23A forensic psychologist, Mr William Warren, considered that the applicant ""does not appear to [have] any significant psychological or psychiatric illness which would predispose him to criminal behaviour in the future"". 

24The applicant had a criminal history which included 10 armed robbery or similar offences for which he was imprisoned in 1982. There were subsequent entries in 1984, 1996, and 2007 for number of offences which resulted in community service, bonds and a fine. 

25The judge was of the view that the applicant was not remorseful. He did, however, allow a reduction of sentence of 5 per cent for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty to the last of the robberies. He also allowed a reduction of 20 per cent for the applicant's assistance to authorities. He described that assistance as involving the applicant volunteering information and possibly putting himself at some risk in gaol as a result. He described the information as being of ""real assistance in respect of the intelligence that has either confirmed other police intelligence or has instigated a line of enquiry"". It did not appear to the judge that there would be a need for the applicant to give evidence, but the information was considered to be truthful, reliable and complete.

26The judge made a finding of special circumstances in the following terms:

I have, after some thought, formed the view that special circumstances is appropriate in the matter, because notwithstanding his relatively mature years, he does have hope of rehabilitation. (R/S 4)

...

As I have indicated, I will find in respect of each matter special circumstances, and those are on two bases. Firstly, the matter that I indicated before, which has been his support and the support of his family that he will have in the future; and secondly, his actions to a lesser or greater extent that will involve him having to be careful whilst in custody. (R/S 7)

27The judge considered the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and made some comparison between the typical case there described and the facts of the present offences.

Ground 1: His Honour erred in only applying the discount of 20% for assistance to authorities (pursuant to section 23 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) to charge 5 and not the balance of the offences.

28The applicant's argument in support of this ground is subsumed by that which was put in support of Ground 4 and will be discussed in that context.

Ground 2: The sentence imposed on charge 5 was manifestly excessive.

29The sentence for the fifth offence (armed robbery at The General Roberts Hotel) was one of 5 years. It was reduced from what it otherwise would have been by 25 per cent on account of the applicant's plea of guilty and assistance. The judge did not say so, but this must mean that the starting point must have been 6 years 8 months. 

30The sentence for the fourth offence (armed robbery at the East Maitland Pharmacy) was one of 6 years. 

31It was submitted for the applicant that 6 years 8 months was not only manifestly excessive, having regard to the Henry guideline, but also inexplicable when the objective seriousness of the fifth offence was similar to that of the fourth offence and arguably less. Reference was made to the fourth offence involving two victims whilst the fifth offence involved only the one.

32The Crown submitted that the sentence for the fifth charge was not manifestly excessive and, in written submissions, pointed to a variety of factors which justified it; for example, the offence had features that distinguished it from the features of the typical offence described in Henry. 

33In oral submissions it was asserted that there was justification for this sentence being longer in that it was the last in a series of serious robbery offences; there were more offences to be taken into account on its Form 1 document; and the victim impact statement indicated significant deleterious consequences had been suffered as a result. The victim in this matter said that he had to leave his job at the hotel and has continued to suffer from anxiety which has affected many aspects of his life.

34I cannot understand why the starting point for the sentence for the fifth (hotel) offence was significantly more than the sentence for the fourth (pharmacy) offence. The exceedingly brief ex tempore reasons given by the judge provided no explanation. The additional offences taken into account on the Form 1 justified some increment but modestly so. Being the last of the offences was not a real point of distinction from the second last of the offences. The victim impact for this offence was significant. But it must also have been for the fourth offence where there were two victims, one of whom was a pregnant 16-year-old young woman who hyperventilated and later suffered an asthma attack, and both of whom were not only threatened with the display of the ""gun"", but were threatened with being shot.

35I am not, however, prepared to conclude that the sentence, having regard to the starting point, for the fifth offence was unreasonable, or plainly unjust: Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 It differed from the typical case in Henry to an extent that warranted a higher sentence that the 4 to 5 years suggested there for that typical case. Comparison with another sentence imposed by the same judge is not a basis for concluding manifest excess. The seriousness of the offending was such that it is just as much open to argue that the sentence for the fourth offence was inadequate as to argue that the sentence for the fifth offence was excessive.

36I would not uphold this ground.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to give practical effect to the finding of special circumstances in the total effective sentence. 

37Ground 3(b) was abandoned at the hearing, which leaves Ground 3(a) in the terms above.

38I set out earlier the two passages from the judge's sentencing remarks in which he provided reasons for finding that there were special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) for setting a balance of the term of the sentence that was more than one-third of the non-parole period.

39A finding of special circumstances does not compel a variation in the non-parole period. But if no variation is made, a judge is expected to give reasons as to why the finding is not being reflected in the ultimate term: Saad v R [2007] NSWCCA 98 at [33]-[36]; Heron v R [2006] NSWCCA 215 at [31]-[32]. This Court may also intervene where the result of accumulation of multiple sentences is to remove the effect of a finding of special circumstances: Stoeski v R [2008] NSWCCA 230 at [25]; Cicekdag v R [2007] NSWCCA 218 at [47]-[49].

40Where there is no adjustment of the 3:1 ratio of non-parole period to parole period reflect in the overall term, it may either reflect what the sentencing judge specifically intended, or it may be the result of inadvertence or miscalculation. A recent example of the former may be found in Houri v R [2013] NSWCCA 279; see also Phipps v R [2008] NSWCCA 178; and Stoeski. Examples of both varieties of the latter can be found in the cases collected by McClellan CJ at CL in Fina'i v R [2006] NSWCCA 134 at [31]-[40]. Appeals asserting such error are not uncommon, and as Howie AJ remarked in Maglis v R [2010] NSWCCA 247 at [24], their success will often ""depend upon what can be gleaned of the Judge's intention from the sentencing remarks"".

41In this case, all that is to be found in the judgment is a statement that there were special circumstances, adjustment of the usual proportions in four of the five individual sentences, but then through the process of accumulation of sentences a final result where the minimum custodial component is some 78 per cent of the overall term. There is nothing to indicate that the judge was aware of, or intended, this result. The statement at the end of the short reasons that ""I cannot give any further discounts or leniency"" cannot be interpreted as advertence to the end result, even making all allowances for the brevity of ex tempore sentencing remarks delivered immediately following submissions.

42I am satisfied that the sentencing discretion miscarried and that this ground should be upheld.

Ground 4: The total sentence imposed of 9 years with a non-parole period of 7 years is manifestly excessive.

43 Submissions advanced by senior counsel on behalf of the applicant at the hearing of the application crystallised the argument to be this: a total effective sentence of 9 years for these offences, where the judge found that the applicant's assistance to authorities warranted a reduction of 20 per cent, was unreasonable and unjust.

44Reference was made to the judgment of Howie J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, in Felton v R [2010] NSWCCA 79 at [45]. There his Honour spoke of the need to assess the individual sentences, including any applicable discount, in accordance with Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 and then to consider totality. But in relation to the latter it is important to ensure that any discount is not eroded by the process of accumulating sentences.

45The argument advanced by the applicant in relation to Ground 1 concerned the application of the discount for assistance to authorities being confined to the fifth charge. The assistance was not related to any of the offences for which the applicant was sentenced. Accordingly, there was no reason to confine the discount to just one of the five sentences. It was accepted that the judge had a discretion in this respect: R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220 at 230E -231D. It was accepted that the judge may have been led to confine the discount as he did by the submissions that were made. It is unnecessary to delve into this because the principal issue is that referred to in the preceding paragraphs. 

46The Crown submissions in relation to Ground 4 referred to the ""unduly generous"" approach of the judge in ordering that the sentences for the second and third offences be served concurrently. I do not regard that as a relevant matter. He could have ordered some partial accumulation and still arrived at the same overall result. 

47Applying the discount for assistance to the last of the sentences to be served had the effect of reducing the overall term of the sentence. If it had been applied to the other sentences, with one exception, it would not necessarily have affected that result. The exception concerns the first offence where other sentences were completely accumulated upon the non-parole period. If the discount had been applied to the sentence for the first offence that would have brought back the commencement of subsequent sentences by about four or five months.

48When there is a degree of accumulation of multiple sentences, I know of no authority (and none were cited) that requires the discount to individual sentences to be reflected with mathematical precision in the resulting overall term. Obviously, however, there is a need for some proportionality. I have come to the view that the judge should have discounted each of the sentences for the applicant's assistance to authorities. There was no reason not to. This should have had a bearing on the overall term, but only to a modest degree.

49Ground 1 should be upheld but Ground 4 should not.

Re-sentencing

50The need for re-sentencing primarily arises because of the error identified under Ground 3, but there is the lesser, though additional, need to do so in respect of Ground 1.

51It is convenient to use the aggregate sentencing provisions in s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. (If they had been used in the District Court, the error identified under Ground 3 would more likely have been noticed by the judge.)

52The individual sentences that would have been imposed involve a reduction by 20 per cent of those imposed in the District Court for the first to fourth matters with some rounding to achieve a practical result. Thus they are:

1. Robbery - Woolworths Liquor, Kotara on 5 April 2010: a sentence of 2 years 5 months.

2. Armed robbery - IGA Store, Telarah on 6 April 2010: a sentence of 3 years 2 months.

3. Attempt robbery - Edgeworth Post Office, Edgeworth on 14 May 2010: a sentence of 2 years 3 months.

4. Armed robbery - East Maitland Pharmacy on 14 May 2010: a sentence of 4 years 10 months.

5. Armed robbery - General Roberts Hotel, New Lambton on 10 October 2010: a sentence of 5 years.

Orders

53I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal allowed.

3. Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court and, in lieu, impose an aggregate sentence of 8 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 years. The sentence is to date from 20 October 2010. The earliest day the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 20 October 2016.

2705635,Vulovic v R [2013] NSWCCA 340,"Judgment

1THE COURT: This is an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed on the applicant by Johnson J following his conviction by a jury. The applicant pleaded not guilty when arraigned on a charge of murdering Tony Darkovski at Canley Heights on 12 November 2009. The jury found him not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for nine years and set a non-parole period of six years.

The Facts

2The applicant boarded at a house in Canley Heights owned by Ilija Plavsic. They had known each other for about 15 years through their work as cement renderers. By November 2009 the applicant had ceased working in that industry, having received a work injury, and was in receipt of an invalid pension. He was 53 years old. 

3The deceased, Tony Darkovski, was friends with Mr. Plavsic and worked with him. He was a big man, 32 years old. Mr. Plavsic and Mr. Darkovski worked together on 12 November 2009. During that day the applicant spent a number of hours at a local café. He had beer to drink there. Mr. Plavsic and Mr. Darkovski returned to the house during the afternoon after they had finished work. They had a conversation about money that Mr. Plavsic owed Mr. Darkovski. Mr. Darkovski went out, bought a five litre cask of wine and brought it to the house. He and Mr. Plavsic began to drink. 

4Later on the same afternoon the applicant returned home, bringing with him beer he had bought. 

5An argument started between the applicant and Mr. Darkovski. Things became violent. A window was broken, a table damaged and an ironing board knocked over. At one stage Mr. Darkovski took the applicant by the throat.

6The applicant went to his room and returned, holding chained fighting sticks called nunchaku. Mr. Darkovski disarmed him. The applicant returned to his room and then went to the kitchen, where he picked up a kitchen knife. He stabbed Mr. Darkovski. There were two wounds to the chest, either of which alone would have been fatal. There were wounds to the left upper arm, the left lower abdomen and the left side of the neck. None of them would have been fatal by itself. There was no evidence how long the attack lasted. The only weapon used was the knife. Bloodstains indicated that the attack had occurred at 3 separate places in the one room.

7Immediately after the stabbing, and before Mr. Plavsic could telephone for an ambulance, the applicant asked him to telephone a friend of his, Ms Olga Savic. He did so and the applicant told Ms Savic: 

The Macedonian has attacked me. There's blood everywhere. Come down. Call Borsa.

8Borsa was the applicant's sister. 

9Immediately afterwards Mr. Plavsic telephoned the emergency services. They attended, but unfortunately Mr. Darkovski was unable to be revived.

10Only two witnesses gave direct evidence of the event, Mr. Plavsic and the applicant. The Crown read a transcript of an interview the applicant had given to the investigating police officers on 12 November 2009, immediately after his arrest. Things said by the applicant in his interview and in evidence were capable of proving provocation by Mr. Darkovski. They included offensive and insulting remarks about the applicant and Ms Savic, threats to the applicant with the assertion that Mr. Darkovski had ""bashed three guys"", demands on the applicant for money and a physical attack on the applicant by Mr. Darkovski's grabbing him by the hair and hooking a finger in his mouth.

11The Crown contended that the applicant was not provoked but acted out of anger. The defence case was that the applicant should be acquitted because there was a reasonable possibility that Mr. Plavsic was the killer. Understandably, therefore, defence counsel did not mention provocation in his closing speech to the jury. 

12In leaving provocation to the jury his Honour said this about the evidence:

I will explain to you what it is that raises provocation in this case as an issue for your consideration. In effect, it emerges entirely from the evidence of the accused or his interview with the police given on 12 November 2009. The matters which are pointed to in the evidence are evidence of the accused asserting that Mr. Darkovski grabbed him by the neck, knocking him to the ground, evidence that the deceased was said to be out of control, evidence that the deceased was said to have started a fight against the accused, evidence of the insult which the deceased is said to have made about Olga. You will perhaps remember that, that is part of the accused's evidence. The suggestion from the accused that Mr. Plavsic had made a crude joke about the use of nunchakus, the evidence of the accused that there were demands for money from him by Mr. Darkovski and Mr. Plavsic and that he felt this was intolerable and his suggestion that Mr. Darkovski had been ""like a terror"" for him in the past asking him for money both at home and in the street.

...

I emphasise, ladies and gentlemen, I am pointing to this because it was part of the evidence before you. What you make of that evidence of the accused is a matter for you as a part of your fact-finding function, but the fact that there are things asserted of this type mean that I need to raise with you the issue of provocation. So it is matters of that type which explain why I am giving you this direction.

...

You may wonder - why is the judge giving us this very complicated formula in this rather straightforward case? The accused of course is not saying that he did stab Mr. Darkovski. But if you find that he did stab Mr. Darkovski and killed him, then these issues arise because of other parts of the evidence of the accused which say that he was being stirred up, there were insults about Olga, there was aggressive conduct towards him and matters of that sort. So, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he did kill Mr. Darkovski, then one gets to this point and because there is some evidence raising the question of provocation, you need to consider these questions if you get to this point.

...

The starting point then are the sort of matters that I have raised, what are said to be insults, threats, and aggressive conduct.

13It was only by finding provocation that the jury could properly have returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 

14The first ground of appeal asserts that his Honour made findings of fact in relation to provocation that were inconsistent with the verdict. His Honour's findings of fact on sentence included these:

Consistent with the verdict of the jury, I am satisfied that at least some of the provocative conduct [and His Honour referred to the evidence he had summarised, which is included in the extract at para [12] above] took place. I am satisfied that much of it occurred in the period when the offender and the deceased were alone, and Mr. Plavsic was in his room.

The fact that Mr. Plavsic did not agree that the provocative events had occurred in his presence may be explained largely in this way. By the time Mr. Plavsic emerged from his room, there was a substantial and heated argument under way between the offender and the deceased. Mr. Plavsic observed events, including physical interaction between the two men. He was affected by alcohol so that, as I have said, his recall of secondary details of the argument was not clear.

...

I am satisfied, as in my view was the jury, that the Offender obtained a knife from the kitchen, after significant acts of provocation had occurred, and that he then used that knife to stab the deceased on some five occasions. The medical evidence of Dr Van Vuuren at trial described five stab wounds to the deceased. Two stab wounds were to the side of the chest. One was to the left upper arm. A further stab wound was in the area of the left lower abdomen and the fifth was to the left side of the neck to the deceased.

...

In my view, the jury had particular regard to aspects of the Offender's ERISP made on the evening of 12 November 2009, in which he said that he had been provoked by the deceased, who had used abusive and intemperate language towards him and had been aggressive towards him.

...

It is clear from the interview that the Offender was well aware, soon after the fatal attack, that he had been abused and manhandled in a way that made him angry and, in his words, ""provoked"" him. The jury's verdict is entirely understandable. The fact that the Offender used this word repeatedly at that time would not have been lost on the jury given that, by the time the jury watched the interview again in the jury room during their deliberations, the concept of provocation had been explained in the summing up.

...

In my view, the evidence does not permit a finding as to which of the Offender and the deceased instigated the argument, and associated aggressive conduct. It is clear that a verbal argument commenced which included insults from the deceased concerning the Offender and Ms Savic, which were directed to the Offender, leading to a physical altercation between two men. I consider that this aspect of the Offender's account given in his ERISP on the evening of the incident formed the real foundation for provocation in this case.

I am satisfied that the Offender and the deceased did not particularly like each other, and that not a great deal was required to lead to friction between the two men. I do not accept the defence submission that the aggressive conduct and words emanated, in a type of one-sided fashion, from the deceased to the Offender.

...

I accept that there was some physical contact whereby the deceased held the Offender around the neck in a strangling-type action. This served further to provoke the Offender. However, I do not accept that the offender lost consciousness for a period of time. Rather, I am satisfied that the offender became free of the deceased and then entered the kitchen in an angry state where he obtained the knife which was used to stab the deceased.

15Mr. Brady, counsel for the applicant, submitted that the following findings were inconsistent with the verdict, namely:
(i)only some of the acts that might have been provocative took place; 

(ii)the evidence did not permit a finding as to who started the fight;

(iii)that in the verbal argument that led to the fight Mr. Darkovski's insults about the applicant and Ms Savic were the real foundation for the finding of provocation; and

(iv)the applicant entered the kitchen in an angry state and obtained the knife with which he stabbed Mr. Darkovski.


16As to (i) above, Mr. Brady submitted that provocation as left to the jury was not so limited, that the jury were not directed that comments about Ms Savic alone would be sufficient to raise a reasonable possibility of provocation, that there was no evidence that ""these comments "" (meaning Mr. Darkovski's insults about the applicant and Ms Savic) led to the fight in which the deceased was stabbed.

17As to (ii) above, Mr. Brady submitted that his Honour did not direct the jury that they could find that the applicant started the fight and find also that he acted under provocation. He submitted that provocation was left to the jury ""very much on the basis of the (deceased's) aggression"", including that Mr. Darkovski grabbed him by the neck, knocking him to the ground, Mr. Darkovski was out of control, he started the fight, there were demands for money, there were threats against the applicant and Mr. Darkovski had been ""like a terror"" (the applicant's description of Mr. Darkovski's behaviour in continually asking to borrow money). For these reasons, the absence of a finding about who was the initial aggressor was ""inconsistent with the considerations left to the jury in determining provocation"". Finally, Mr. Brady submitted that ""it is difficult to envisage that the jury would have concluded that there was a reasonable possibility that the applicant was acting under provocation without concluding that there was a reasonable possibility that the deceased was the aggressor"".

18As to (iii) above, Mr. Brady submitted that provocation as left to the jury was not so limited and that his Honour did not direct the jury that Mr. Darkovski's comments about Ms Savic alone would suffice to raise a reasonable possibility of provocation. Finally, Mr. Brady submitted that there was no evidence that the comments led to the ""physical altercation"".

19 As to (iv) above, Mr. Brady submitted that his Honour's finding that the applicant was angry when he entered the kitchen was not consistent with a finding of provocation since his Honour had told the jury that:

Provocation is concerned with a loss of self-control by the accused at the time of the act causing death, that is acting under a temporary loss of reason and not simply in anger or in revenge.

20It was submitted generally that when identifying the evidence relevant to provocation ""the matters were put to them effectively as a combination of factors"", and while the jury were directed that they could accept part and reject part of the evidence of a witness, the direction ""was not linked to the issue of provocation"". 

21In summary these long and detailed submissions proposed that the effect of his Honour's directions was that the jury could find provocation only if satisfied about all the evidence left to them as relevant to provocation. Since the jury did find provocation, they must have accepted all the relevant evidence. Therefore his Honour, to be consistent with the findings of the jury, had to be satisfied about all of it. To the extent that he did not, his findings were inconsistent with the verdict. In written submissions Mr. Brady identified a number of additional facts that he submitted were relevant to the question of provocation and which the judge ought to have taken into account. They were: - 


That Mr. Darkovski grabbed the applicant by the neck and knocked him to the ground;
That Mr. Darkovski was out of control;
That Mr. Darkovski started the fight;
That Mr. Darkovski made demands for money from the applicant;
That Mr. Darkovski threatened the applicant; and
That Mr. Darkovski had been ""like a terror"".

22There are two reasons why we do not accept the submission. First, we do not accept that his Honour told the jury that they could find provocation only on an acceptance of all the factors identified. This was a trial in which the only evidence challenged was that of the two opposing witnesses. In instructing the jury about fact finding His Honour said at SU [48] - [49]:

When you come to consider the questions of credibility and reliability, you should bear in mind you do not have to accept everything a witness has said, nor do you have to reject everything a witness has said. It is a matter for you to make you own assessment as to what evidence you accept as truthful and reliable. It is important that you approach the consideration of a witness whose evidence is under challenge in this way, conscious of the fact that you can accept some part of what the witness says and not other parts. It is a matter for you, as I have said, in the same way as you approach the acceptance of the truthfulness or reliability of things that you are told in your own day-to-day lives. Counsel addressed you on that point. Your experience of life and your common sense in assessing whether you are being told the truth, or whether what you are being told is reliable or accurate are valuable tools for you in exercising your functions as jurors.

In determining what parts of the evidence of witnesses you accept or reject, you are required of course to use your common sense and understanding of human beings, how human beings act and what they do in given situations. You make your assessment taking into account the various mechanisms that you use in your everyday lives to determine whether someone is telling you the truth, or whether someone is giving you an accurate history of events. That will include, as I have already mentioned, what you make of the behaviour or body language in the witness box, the demeanour of the witness. You will take into account of course any inconsistencies in the account given to you by the witness and any account the witness may have given on other occasions, and it is necessary for you of course to determine how important you consider any such inconsistency is to the reliability or honesty of the witness's evidence in this trial.

23It is correct to say that his Honour made no reference in those passages to any particular issue of fact raised at the trial, and while it is also correct to say that when directing the jury about provocation his Honour did not refer to the direction he had given about fact-finding, it must have been obvious to the jury that the Crown's major criticism of the evidence of the applicant was that not everything he said was true. The Crown had already addressed the jury and had submitted that the applicant was not telling the truth, but that attack was not made on everything the applicant said. For example, the Crown did not challenge the applicant's evidence that Mr. Darkovski had seized him by the throat. It was common ground, because Mr. Plavsic said that that happened.

24By the time the jury received his Honour's charge about accepting some parts of a witness's evidence and rejecting others, these issues on the evidence of the applicant were in their minds. In our opinion, his Honour's directions correctly permitted the jury to differentiate between the several factors left to them as relevant to provocation, and to come to such a conclusion, if the evidence justified it, on all or fewer than all of those factors.

25A second reason for concluding that this ground of appeal has not been made good is that the submissions confuse the roles of the jury and the sentencing Judge in the finding of facts. The verdict of the jury implies findings only of facts the jury were bound to find in order properly to come to its verdict. That, as we have said, might have been achieved by reliance on all or fewer than all of the factors identified by his Honour. The verdict was silent on the question of which factor or factors led to the jury's conclusion. Which of those factors were relevant for sentencing, however, was a matter exclusively for his Honour and in making his findings his Honour was bound to apply his own assessment of the evidence. That assessment was bound to depend on his Honour's impression of the applicant's reliability. Having identified the relevant factors his Honour had to weigh and apply them. 

26In Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1 the majority of the Justices of the High Court of Australia, Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ said at [6]: - 

The appellant was charged with being knowingly concerned in a large importation of heroin. Obviously, there were others involved as well. The nature and extent of the appellant's involvement, including the period of his participation in the enterprise, his relationship with the other participants, his contribution to the success of the scheme, the financial reward he might have expected, and the reasons for his involvement, were all matters which, if capable of being ascertained, were of possible relevance to an assessment of his culpability. The jury heard evidence bearing upon some or all of those matters. Such evidence might or might not have been of significance to some or all of the jurors, in the process by which they reasoned as to the guilt of the appellant. But they were not matters on which issue was joined, and which the jury, by verdict, decided. That does not mean that the jury's verdict was ""ambiguous"". It simply means that, on those subjects, the jury's verdict was silent. What the jury had to decide was whether, between two specified dates, the appellant was knowingly concerned in the importation of heroin that occurred on 9 May 1989. A variety of questions of potential relevance to the duration and extent of his involvement were raised by the evidence; but some of them, although potentially significant for sentencing purposes, were not questions which the jury had to decide in order to reach a conclusion that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged. They were questions which, if capable of resolution at all, were to be resolved by the sentencing judge.

27At [14] their Honours referred thus to the judgment of this court in R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 per Gleeson GJ, Mason P, Hunt CJ at CL and Simpson and Hidden JJ at 377-378: - 

In Isaacs the Court of Criminal Appeal summarized certain well-established principles concerning the law and practice of sentencing in New South Wales as follows (omitting references to authority): 

""1. Where, following a trial by jury, a person has been convicted of a criminal offence, the power and responsibility of determining the punishment to be inflicted upon the offender rest with the judge, and not with the jury ... 
2. Subject to certain constraints, it is the duty of the judge to determine the facts relevant to sentencing. Some of these facts will have emerged in evidence at the trial; others may only emerge in the course of the sentencing proceedings. ... 

3. The primary constraint upon the power and duty of decision-making referred to above is that the view of the facts adopted by the judge for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdict of the jury. ... 

4. A second constraint is that findings of fact made against an offender by a sentencing judge must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. 

5. There is no general requirement that a sentencing judge must sentence an offender upon the basis of the view of the facts, consistent with the verdict, which is most favourable to the offender. ... However, the practical effect of 4 above, in a given case, may be that, because the judge is required to resolve any reasonable doubt in favour of the accused, then the judge will be obliged, for that reason, to sentence upon a view of the facts which is most favourable to the offender. ... "" 

28In our opinion his Honour was entitled to conclude that only the two factors identified, namely Mr. Darkovski's offensive remarks and his seizing the applicant by the neck, were relevant to provocation.

29The second ground of Appeal asserts that his Honour erred in finding that the provocative conduct did not constitute a high degree of provocation. The ground depends on the success of the first. As we have said, his Honour was not bound to find that all the features that might have been provocative in fact provoked the applicant.

30His Honour's assessment of the degree of provocation as relevant to the seriousness of the offence was limited to the two factors he identified. In our opinion the assessment was open to His Honour.

31The third ground of Appeal is as follows: - 

Ground 3

The Learned Sentencing Judge erred in his findings in relation to the applicant's mental conditions in the following ways:

a. That there was no causal nexus between the crime and the applicant's mental conditions;

b. That the applicant's mental conditions did not reduce the weight to be given to general deterrence; and

c. The fact that custody was more onerous on the applicant was taken into account on sentence.

32On sentence two reports of Dr Nielssen, psychiatrist, were received into evidence. Dr Nielssen did not give oral evidence. He had not previously seen the applicant. In his first report, written on 1 June 2010, Dr Nielssen said that he had been able to interview the applicant without the assistance of an interpreter. He said that the applicant spoke in heavily accented English and did not understand a number of questions put to him until they were restated in clearer terms. However, he considered the applicant's English adequate for the purposes of their interviews. There were two interviews, the first on 17 November 2009 and the second, by audio visual link, on 9 March 2010. 

33Dr Nielssen wrote: - 

Psychiatric History

Mr. Vulovic said that he was not aware of any family history of any kind of psychiatric disorder or treatment. He said that he had not had any contact with mental health services during his upbringing and prior to coming to Australia.

Mr. Vulovic said that he had previously seen a Serbian speaking psychiatrist, Dr Kecmanovic, located in Newtown, who he said prescribed an antidepressant medication doxepin (Endep) that he was unable to continue because of side effects. He said that he was also prescribed an antidepressant during admission to Corella House drug detoxification centre in early 2009 and had also been prescribed sertraline (Zoloft) and escitalopram (Lexapro) by his general practitioner, however, he said that he did not persist with any of the medications for long.

He said that he found the sessions with Dr Tomic, a psychiatrist who spoke his language to be of considerable assistance in managing anxiety symptoms. He said that he had tried to follow Dr Tomic's advice to withdraw from alprazolam, and had been able to get through some days without any alprazolam, including the three days just before his arrest.

He said that his general practitioner referred him to a specialist in substance use but he had not been able to keep the appointment because he was arrested.

Mr. Vulovic said that he had been very depressed since his arrest. He said that he had experienced several panic attacks after being locked in his cell and said that he had ""buzzed up"" and sought urgent medical review. He said that his blood pressure was found to be high, but he had been referred for a number of cardiac investigations, which showed no abnormalities. He denied planning to kill himself.

He said that he had seen a female psychologist but was yet to see a psychiatrist and had not been prescribed an antidepressant medication. He said that the previous treatment with medication had not helped, but he had been affected by other problems in his life at that time.

In response to questions about the presence of symptoms of psychotic illness, Mr. Vulovic denied ever experiencing hallucinations of voices or ever holding any of the common persecutory beliefs, for example, that he had been under surveillance, that he was the victim of any kind of conspiracy or that his health had been tampered with in any way. He denied believing that he was in any kind of danger from Mr. Darkovski.

34Dr Nielssen did not see any report from Dr Kecmanovic or Dr Tomic, though he did see a referral to Dr Tomic by Dr Srinavasan and assorted specialist referrals from a General Practice called Medoptix. Dr Nielssen noted diagnoses of anxiety and depression. He saw a written statement from Ms Savic and a statement of the applicant's sister confirming the history of anxiety and depression. There was a history of difficulty with alcohol and other drugs for which the applicant had received assistance in hospital.

35Dr Nielssen took a history from the applicant as follows: - 

Mr. Vulovic said that he came to Australia from Serbia in 1992 and did not speak any English prior to his arrival. He spoke in heavily accented English and did not understand a number of questions put to him until they were restated in clearer terms. However, his English was considered to be adequate for the purpose of the interviews.

Mr. Vulovic confirmed that he had been charged with murder of an acquittance and former work mate of Macedonian origin, Tony Darkovski. He said that his memory of the events was not complete. He said that he had not entered a plea to the charge, but hoped to raise the effect of provocation by Mr. Darkovski, his own fear of being attacked and his psychological problems in his defence.

When asked to explain what happened in his own words he said ""there is a big story behind this"". He said that it stemmed from problems with Mr. Darkovski, who he said was a ""big drinker"" and always short of money. He said that Mr. Darkovski was a cement renderer of large build and often boasted about his strength. Mr. Vulovic said that he was always careful not to make him angry, and said that he also spoke to him in a kind way because he was young.

Mr. Vulovic said that the offence occurred at a house where he rented a room from a friend, a fellow cement renderer named Ilija Pavlic. He said that Mr. Pavlic was an occasional drinking partner of Mr. Darkovski, but also resented him coming around to his house asking for money. Mr. Vulovic said that Mr. Pavlic had previously told him that if Mr. Darkovski knocked on the door he was not to let him in.

Mr. Vulovic said that at the time of the offence he was unable to work because of injuries sustained in a fall at work and was living on reduced workers compensation payments. He said that he sustained injuries to his back, elbow and a blow to the head in the fall, as well as a fractured toe that did not heal and for which he needed an operation to unite the fracture.

He said that while he was prescribed medications for pain relief and to control anxiety symptoms, and had become dependent on the anxiety relieving sedative alprazolam (Xanax). He said that his use of alprazolam had contributed to a previous incident in which he had come to the attention of the police in early 2009 after he kicked a poker machine at a hotel whilst affected by the medication. He said that he was directed to attend drug detoxification at Corella House, a drug rehabilitation unit attached to Fairfield Hospital. He said that he completed the withdrawal with the assistance of a longer acting benzodiazepine medication, diazepam (known by the brand names Valium and Ducene) and was able to go without the medication for several months. However, he said that he continued to experience anxiety symptoms that were not controlled by diazepam and he returned to taking alprazolam.

Mr. Vulovic said that in the months before the offence he was referred to a Serbian speaking psychologist, Dr Tomic, who conducted several questionnaires and told him that he was taking too many alprazolam tablets. Mr. Vulovic said that he attempted to take Dr Tomic's advice by cutting down on tablets and for three days prior to the offence he has no tablets at all. He said that after stopping the medication he experienced intense anxiety symptoms, including panic attacks that came without warning or any apparent trigger and which he attempted to control using the breathing technique taught to him by Dr Tomic.

Mr. Vulovic said that on the day of the offence he remembered feeling in a good mood when he woke up. He said that he made a healthy breakfast and did some shopping for fruit and then practiced on the keyboard, as he was due to perform at a club in Bonnyrigg the following week. He said that later in the morning he went to a coffee shop frequented by Serbian speaking people and had a coffee. However, he said that at the coffee shop he had a panic attack and felt very uncomfortable. He said that he kept an alprazolam tablet in his wallet in case of an unexpected panic attack when out of the house and took the tablet. However, he said that when his anxiety state did not settle quickly he went to the bottle shop next door and bought a six pack of 375ml bottles of Tooheys Extra Dry beer, before returning home. He said that when he arrived home he had two of the beers and may have had taken several more tablets of alprazolam, but he did not remember exactly how many he took.

He said that the anxiety symptoms abated after a while and he spent some of the afternoon practicing on the keyboard. He said that Mr. Palvic came home with Mr. Darkovski after working together that day. He said that they drank beer in the sitting room but he stayed in his bedroom at first. He said that when he came out, Mr. Darkovski made a rude remark to him saying that he ""lived like a king"" which he said he took as a negative comment about his situation, receiving worker's compensation insurance payments and having money for a television, a keyboard and other comforts while Mr. Darkovski was always short of money and constantly asking to borrow money. He said that Mr. Darkovski also made an insulting remark about his girlfriend Olga, but said that he did not react to the remark and said that the events that followed were not a reaction to insulting remarks.

Mr. Vulovic said that at one stage Mr. Palvic challenged him to an arm wrestle, but he said that he was not able to match him because he was much bigger and stronger and also because his injured elbow gave him pain. He said that Mr. Darkovski joined in the test of strength in a threatening way by demonstrating how he could immobilise an opponent by putting his finger inside his cheek and then pushed him to the ground and compressing his airway. During the initial interview Mr. Vulovic showed me fingerprint shaped bruises under both arms that he said were sustained in the struggle with Mr. Darkovski. He said that when Mr. Darkovski had his hand on his throat he felt as though he was going to pass out.

Mr. Vulovic said that after breaking free from Mr. Darkovski's demonstration he was knocked to the ground and hit his head, and had no further memory or what took place. Mr. Vulovic said that his next memory was a vague memory of being handcuffed by the police at the scene. He said that he had no memory of ringing his sister or his girlfriend Olga. He said that he did not remember stabbing Mr. Darkovski, or where the knife came from, although he assumes it was the small kitchen knife used to cut fruit and vegetables.

Mr. Vulovic said that he had no particular grievance towards Mr. Darkovski, other than resentment at his frequent requests to borrow money and said that there had been no previous altercations or disputes. He said that he was not especially offended by the remarks and his perception of the events was that Mr. Darkovski attacked him and that he had been forced to defend himself.

When interviewed again on 9.3.10, Mr. Vulovic said that he had thought about what happened over and over but could not remember picking up the knife, He said that since his arrest he had experienced recurrent dreams of the deceased. He said that he was afraid to go to sleep. He said that he shared a cell with a person who thought he was crazy for screaming out at night. He said that his dreams did not always include events surrounding the actual offence, but were always violent and involved killing.

When asked about symptoms of depression in the period before his arrest, Mr. Vulovic said that he felt he was very depressed at that time. He said that he had stopped going out regularly and felt too depressed to visit his sister or girlfriend. He said that he did not sleep well, had no concentration, little energy and motivation and was aware of feeling very anxious. He said that he had felt very depressed since his arrest, and said ""my life is broken because of what I have done"" and ""these two friends broke my life"". However, he denied contemplating suicide.

36Dr Nielssen diagnosed the applicant as suffering from panic disorder, benzodiazepine dependence syndrome in remission and depressive illness. He wrote: - 

Opinion

The diagnosis of panic disorder is made on the basis of Mr. Vulovic's account of typical symptoms of panic disorder accompanied by avoidance of feared situations and abuse of anti-anxiety medication to alleviate symptoms. The history of panic attacks is documented by his general practitioners and in admissions to Liverpool Hospital.

The diagnosis of dependence on benzodiazepine (anxiety relieving sedative) medication is based on the account of use of more than prescribed doses of alprazolam and the history of withdrawal symptoms and panic attacks in the course of attempting to withdraw from the medication. There was a record of long term use of alprazolam, an admission for detoxification and referral for treatment. Mr. Vulovic looked to be experiencing symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal at the time of the initial interview conducted soon after his arrest.

The diagnosis of depressive illness is made on the basis of Mr. Vulovic's account of symptoms of depression prior to his arrest, including disturbed sleep, withdrawal from company, lack of energy and anxiety symptoms, and the account of symptoms and Mr. Vulovic's presentation at the interviews. The history is supported by the medical records and the statements of his sister and girlfriend.

Mr. Vulovic has a complicated series of conditions that contributed to his mental state at the time of the stabbing of Mr. Darkovski, including the effects of a longstanding anxiety disorder, his depressed mood, the recent attempt to withdraw from benzodiazepine medication and the effect of alprazolam tablets and alcohol taken in response to a panic attack earlier on the day of the offence.

Mr. Vulovic's anxiety disorder and depressive illness are underlying conditions within the meaning of Section 23A of the Crimes Act that gave rise to an abnormal state of mind at the time of the offence. He was also affected by benzodiazepine medication and alcohol, however, I would not consider this to be voluntary intoxication, as he took the tablets and consumed the alcohol in response to anxiety symptoms brought about by his attempts to withdraw from benzodiazepine medication in the days before the offence.

Moreover, from Mr. Vulovic's account of the events, it seems that he was subjected to threats and provocation by the deceased and in his anxious state of mind is likely to have interpreted the behaviour of the deceased as being more threatening than he might have if he were not affected by an anxiety disorder.

He was not thought to have a defect of reason in the form of a delusional belief regarding the deceased that might leave open the defence of mental illness. Mr. Vulovic was assessed to be fit to enter a plea and to be fit for trial.

37Dr Nielssen saw the applicant on 15 February 2012 after his conviction. He wrote a report on 16 February 2012, diagnosing anxiety disorder in partial remission, depressive illness in remission and substance dependence and abuse disorder in remission. 

38Counsel filed written submissions on sentence, including these: - 

Psychological Condition

i. The offender was suffering, at the time of the offence, from a long standing depressive illness and anxiety disorder.

ii. The disorders from which he suffered were significant and there was a real casual (scil. causal) connection between those disorders and his offending behaviour.

iii. In particular, the fact that he suffered from those disorders led to him interpreting the threats and provocation of the deceased as more significant than a person unaffected by those disorders.

iv. That is, the disorders led to a defect in reasoning, making the offender less able to make reasoned judgements and control his actions.

39In oral submissions his Honour asked counsel what link there was between the applicant's psychological conditions and the offence. Counsel referred his Honour to a paragraph in Dr Nielssen's first report, extracted in the passages above, dealing with s23A Crimes Act. His Honour observed that s23A, which is concerned with substantial impairment by abnormality of mind, had not been relevant at the trial. His Honour asked counsel how that evidence established the necessary link. The debate continued: - 

BRADY: What you are meant to do with that is to see there was a psychiatric condition affecting the offender at the time, and it is not to be put forward, obviously it is a different basis for the verdict, but it is to be taken into account in determining his moral culpability.

HIS HONOUR: But what is the psychiatric condition? He was able to get around, he came home, various events occurred, there are different descriptions between Mr. Plavsic and him, and on the jury verdict events occurred that gave rise to provocation and he stabbed Mr. Darkovski. What does his mental condition have by way of any causal link to that?

BRADY: What your Honour can see in the second last paragraph of page 8 in the report from Dr Nielssen indicates ""Moreover Mr. Vulovic's account of events seem to suggest provocation by the deceased"".

HIS HONOUR: That's basically what the jury found in the evidence, although it wasn't the accused's case at the trial.

BRADY: It wasn't, but the accused gave evidence that's what happened, and his record of interview indicated that's what happened. So that's clearly something that has been proved, or alternatively, I should say, something the jury obviously found that the Crown could not exclude, and your Honour would need to deal with it on that basis that effectively that is the case. And in my submission, anxious state of mind is likely to have interpreted the behaviour of the deceased being more threatening than he might have been if he had not been affected by the anxiety disorder. He goes on to talk about there was no defect reasoning from the delusional beliefs.

There's no doubt, and your Honour will see at page 7 under Psychiatric Diagnosis, panic disorder, benzodiazepine tendency (sic. Dependency), and depressive illness as being the three psychiatric diagnoses set out by Dr Nielssen, and there is in my submission, on Dr Nielssen's report, clear evidence that his anxiety disorder led him interpreting things perhaps even differently than a person without that disorder would interpret them, which in my submission leads to a reduction in moral culpability.

...

Mr. Vulovic in fact suffered from a disorder that led him to have less capability than a reasonable person to discern provocation threats, so that his disorder has actually reduced the moral culpability of what otherwise would have been a crime.

HIS HONOUR: He was more anxious than the average citizen.

BRADY: He was more anxious.

HIS HONOUR: Is he?

BRADY: Absolutely. When you are talking about a diagnosis of panic disorder and depressive illness, this is not someone who is a bit more anxious, and your Honour will appreciate this is a man who has been hospitalised, has had overdoses, a man who clearly had ambulance records confirming a history of transfer to hospital following anxiety attack, this is not a bit more anxious than a normal person.

HIS HONOUR: I understand that, that's part of his subjective circumstances. The question is whether these matters have a causal nexus to the crime of manslaughter.

BRADY: Absolutely. In my submission, he does, from what Dr Nielssen set out. And what Dr Nielssen is saying has to be borne in mind, that he is talking about anxiety disorder. He is not talking about he is a bit more anxious, and he makes it perfectly clear in that second last paragraph, in my submission, if read in conjunction with what sort of anxiety disorder one is talking about.

40Counsel referred to case law and continued: - 

In my submission, bearing in mind what is set out in the report of Dr Nielssen, what your Honour has heard in fact in the record of interview from Mr. Vulovic, this is not a moderately severe condition and is in fact psychiatric diagnosis is one of panic disorder.

41In sentencing the applicant his Honour dealt with the asserted link thus: - 

The Offender's Mental State at the Time of the Offence

Mr. Brady tendered, at the sentencing hearing, reports of Dr Olav Nielssen, psychiatrist, dated 1 June 2010 (Sentence Exhibit 1) and 16 February 2012 (Sentence Exhibit 2). Upon the basis of these reports, coupled with some limited evidence given at the trial and a number of documents perused by Dr Nielssen, it was submitted that the Offender suffered from certain disorders as at 12 November 2009 in the form of panic disorder, benzodiazepine dependent syndrome and depressive illness. It was submitted that there was a real causal connection between one or more of those disorders and his offering behaviour, so as to attract the principles in authorities such as R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228.

The onus lies on the Offender to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that he suffered from a disorder which had a causal connection to his offending behaviour. My Brady submitted that the first report of Dr Nielssen (Exhibit 1, page 8) supported the conclusion that the Offender's panic disorder (in particular) placed him in a state of mind where, when subject to threats and provocation by the deceased, he interpreted the behaviour of the deceased as being more threatening than he might have if he were not affected by an anxiety disorder.

Mr. Brady sought as well to rely on parts of Dr Nielssen's report which referred to substantial impairment under s.23A Crimes Act 1900.

No substantial impairment issue was raised at the trial in reliance upon s.23A, nor was any medical evidence adduced before the jury. The first report of Dr Nielssen was of a type sometimes seen in murder cases where an assessment is made concerning fitness to be tried, and any possible defence by way of mental illness or substantial impairment. The reference to s.23A was brief and, in any event, was not litigated at trial. That part of the report does not assist the Offender.

I note that Dr Nielssen in his reports states that there is no psychotic condition or mental illness affecting the Offender.

I accept that the Offender has a history of conditions referred to by Dr Nielssen. However, I am not satisfied that there was a causal connection, in the sense recognised by law, between any of those conditions and the Offender's crime.

I am not persuaded that any condition from which he suffered had the relevant causal nexus to the crime committed by the Offender on 12 November 2009. The existence of those conditions is relevant to the Offender's subjective circumstances, but I do not think that they operate to reduce his moral culpability or the objective gravity of the offence, nor do they reduce the weight which should be given to general deterrence on sentence.

42It was submitted in this Court that the evidence of Dr Nielssen clearly established the causal connection and that the evidence was clear that the applicant was likely to interpret the threats of the deceased as more significant than would a person unaffected by the disorders that affected him. Those disorders, it was submitted, led to a defect of reasoning. Counsel referred to his Honour's remarks that substantial impairment was not relied on at trial and submitted that that appeared to be the only express reason for rejecting the defence submission about a causal link. It was submitted that that fact did not lead to the conclusion that there was no causal nexus.

43The burden of proving the causal connection contended for lay on the applicant. Apart from such evidence of the applicant as his Honour was prepared to accept, the only evidence was the report of Dr Nielssen. Although Dr Nielssen had seen the applicant since the verdict, he had not seen any further documents. Dr Nielssen knew that the verdict of manslaughter was by provocation and was aware that he had expressed the opinion in his first report about anxiety disorder and depressive illness as underlying conditions within the meaning of s23A of the Crimes Act. He said nothing about those conditions as they might have related to provocation. Of course, Dr Nielssen could not have known what his Honour would find about what had provoked the applicant, but he could have been told what evidence had been left to the jury as possibly provocative and he could have been asked to offer an opinion, however tentative, about any increased susceptibility of the applicant to provocation on account of his mental state.

44Remarkably, no evidence of the kind was offered. Instead, Counsel invited his Honour to infer from what Dr Nielssen had said about substantial impairment by abnormality of mind that in accordance with what Dr Nielssen had said in the first report the applicant must, because of his anxious state of mind, have interpreted Mr. Darkovski's behaviour as more threatening than he might have if not so affected.

45Dr Nielssen's principal consideration was whether the applicant had a verdict of manslaughter available by way of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind. His reference to threats and provocation was a secondary consideration. Moreover, the threats, evidence of which was put before Dr Nielssen in stark terms, turned out not to be provocative at all. They were not even left to the jury as possibly provocative. In dealing with provocative acts Dr Nielssen assumed, perforce, that all the acts of Mr. Darkovski described by the applicant were provocative. That turned out not to be the case either, but it was on that assumption that Dr Nielssen expressed the view that the applicant was ""likely to have interpreted the behaviour of the deceased as being more threatening than he might have if he were not affected by an anxiety disorder"".

46Accordingly, there was available to the applicant no considered opinion of the probable effect on the applicant, given his psychological state at the time, of the acts of Mr. Darkovski that were found to be provocative.

47In our opinion his Honour was entitled to find on the evidence that the link had not been established.

48We are also of the opinion that it was open to his Honour to find that the applicant's mental condition was not such as to warrant a reduction in the weight that should be given to general deterrence. The mental condition of the applicant was not such as to render him an inappropriate medium to make an example of to others.

49The final aspect of this ground claims that his Honour erred in not finding that the applicant's custody would be more onerous by reason of his mental condition. It was submitted in this Court that although a submission to that effect was made on sentence, his Honour did not refer to the matter in imposing sentence. It was submitted that in view of the importance of the matter it should not be assumed that his Honour had the submission in mind when sentencing.

50According to Dr Nielssen's revised diagnosis, the Applicant's anxiety disorder was in partial remission. His other two disorders, including depressive illness, were in remission. On the other hand, the author of the pre-sentence report said this:

It appears that Mr. Vulovic has been experiencing significant depression for some time and he admitted that at times he feels suicidal. This premise is confirmed by case notes documented by custodial staff after he was taken into custody, and it is noted that in November 2010 he was placed on suicide watch. Mr. Vulovic is currently taking antidepressant medication, although he said he continues to feel depressed.

It is noted that Mr. Vulovic has been alcohol free for the last two years, but his depression remains a significant issue for him.

51In his second report Dr Nielssen said:

Mr. Vulovic said that he had continued to experience anxiety symptoms although he said they were not as severe as they had been because of the medication he was taking. He said that when anxiety symptoms were present he was reluctant to leave his cell, and he had not sought employment within the prison because of the effect of anxiety symptoms.

... 

Mr. Vulovic's anxiety disorder is described as being in partial remission, as he is aware of continuing symptoms of anxiety, especially in groups or away from the perceived safety of his cell.

52Dr Nielssen also observed that the Applicant had greatly benefited from a stress management course he had undertaken and from instruction he had received in stress management techniques.

53His Honour was not bound to assume that the applicant would not continue to be observed and assisted by those having the care of him, particularly where need had been established. His Honour was not bound to assume that further courses of instruction and advice would not be offered. One of the conclusions of the author of the pre-sentence report was this:

Taking into account all of the above information and incorporating a standardised risk/needs assessment process, Mr. Vulovic is suitable for a medium to high level of intervention by this Service, commensurate with the assessed risk. The case plan would include primary strategies regarding his assessment for eligibility/entry into the Department's violent offenders therapeutic program.

54In our opinion the applicant's treatable anxiety did not have the significance contended for on sentence. We do not regard his Honour's not mentioning the matter as indicating that he overlooked it.

55In any event, his Honour took into account the applicant's mental condition in assessing his prospects of rehabilitation and in deciding to extend the available period of parole. At RS [88]-[89] His Honour said this:

The Offender's subjective circumstances are reasonably favourable. Against the background of an external period free of alcohol and with a stable medication regime, his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable, in particular with an extended period of parole supervision.

Mr. Brady submitted that the Court should find special circumstances given the Offender's age, the fact that this is his first sentence of imprisonment and the advantages which will flow from an extended period of supervision in the community as an aid to his rehabilitation and the protection of the community. I am satisfied that special circumstances have been demonstrated in this case, so as to warrant a variation in the ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence for the purpose of s.44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

56This aspect of the third ground of appeal has not been made good.

57A ground asserting manifest excess was appropriately abandoned.

58We make the following orders:

(1)Grant leave to appeal.

(2)Dismiss the appeal.

		04 February 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705642,Mariam v R; R v Mariam [2013] NSWCCA 338,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: On 28 February 2012 Mahmoud Mariam was arraigned, jointly with two others (a juvenile known as HEK, and Adel Elkobaili), in the Supreme Court on an indictment that charged one count of murder, and one count of affray. HEK was also charged with one count of arson. All accused entered pleas of not guilty to all counts, a jury was empanelled and a trial commenced.

2On 28 May 2012, the jury returned its verdicts. It found Mariam not guilty of murder, but guilty of the alternative count of manslaughter and guilty of the affray charge. It found HEK not guilty of murder, not guilty of manslaughter, but guilty of affray and guilty of the further count of arson. It found Adel Elkobaili not guilty of murder, not guilty of manslaughter, and not guilty of affray. Elkobaili's acquittals were the consequence of a successful defence of self-defence. 

3By s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900, the maximum penalty for an offence of manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. By s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for an offence of affray is imprisonment for 10 years.

4On 30 August 2012 Latham J sentenced Mariam. On the conviction for affray, she imposed a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years, commencing on 24 April 2010 and expiring on 23 April 2013. In respect of the manslaughter conviction, she imposed a sentence of 7 years and 9 months, made up of a non-parole period of 5 years and 9 months with a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 24 July 2010, and therefore accumulated by 3 months on the sentence for affray. The aggregate sentence was therefore one of imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. In sentencing as she did, Latham J took into account that, on two earlier occasions (16 May 2011 and 20 February 2012) Mariam had, through his legal representatives, offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. The Crown declined to accept the plea on that basis. Having regard to the jury verdict, and Mariam's offer of a plea of guilty to the offence of which he was ultimately convicted, Latham J reduced the sentence she would otherwise have imposed on the count of manslaughter by 15 per cent. The starting point for that sentence may therefore be taken to have been 9 years. A non-parole period in the statutory ratio (s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"")) would have been 6 years and 9 months. Latham J found no special circumstances that would justify departure from the statutory ratio. The aggregate sentence reflects that conclusion.

5On 17 September 2012, pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director""), filed and served notice of appeal against the sentences, asserting that they were manifestly inadequate. On 3 June 2013 Mariam filed a notice of application for leave to appeal against what he asserted was the manifestly excessive severity of the sentences. Given the timing of the application, Mariam needed an extension of time to make the application. That extension was granted at the commencement of the hearing of the appeal. On 26 June 2013 the Director filed an amended notice of appeal, pleading three specific grounds (set out below). Mariam has not appealed against the convictions. Having regard to the separate proceedings, it will be convenient to continue to refer to him by his surname. 




The grounds

6By his amended of notice of appeal, the Director asserts three grounds:

""Ground 1: Her Honour erred by failing to accumulate the sentences sufficiently.

Ground 2: Her Honour erred by finding that specific deterrence had limited significance.

Ground 3: The sentences, individually and in total, are manifestly inadequate.""

7Mariam pleads one ground only, framed as follows:

""1. The sentencing judge erred in determining the facts.""

8Since the Director's appeal can only be decided when the facts are fully known, it will be convenient to deal first with Mariam's application for leave to appeal against sentence. 

Background

9The charges arise out of an event that took place in Milperra on 25 June 2009. On that evening, HEK was involved in a physical altercation with another young man at a Bankstown shopping centre. Also present was Adam Mariam, Mariam's younger brother. As a result, plans were made, by telephone, for retaliation. A group supporting HEK, and a group that included Mariam, his two brothers, and others, arranged to meet to pursue the conflict. Later that evening, in company with two others, Mariam drove in a Mazda motor vehicle to the car park of a fast food outlet and a supermarket. He was armed with a loaded Ruger pistol. Also present, in a Honda sedan, were his two younger brothers. The specific purpose of their presence was to confront the other group, of whom the two co-accused (HEK and Adel Elkobaili) were members. 

10HEK's party of six men arrived at about 10.25pm in a white van. There appears to have been evidence (to which this Court was not directly referred) that the HEK group were in possession of a variety of weapons, including a rifle, a rock, a spanner and a piece of timber. In all, as many as eleven men gathered in the car park for the express purpose of a confrontation. 

11On a signal (activating the high beam of the headlights of the Honda containing Mariam's brothers), Mariam and one of his companions, Rani Abdulhardi, began walking towards the white van. Mariam began shooting at HEK's group. Over a short period of time he discharged his firearm in their direction at least ten times. One of the bullets struck Mariam's younger brother in the arm. At some point, the rifle in the possession of the HEK group was fired by Adel Elkobaili, injuring Abdulhardi in the stomach. These events gave rise to the charges of affray.

12The car park borders a busy main road, Milperra Road. Mr Robert Knight was a truck driver, who was driving his truck on Milperra Road. He had nothing to do with the events in the car park. One of the bullets fired by Mariam entered the window of his truck, and struck him on the right side of the head. It killed him instantly. That gave rise to the charge of murder, in respect of which the jury found Mariam guilty of the alternative offence of manslaughter. 

13The van which had brought HEK's group to the car park left the scene. It was later found burned out. That gave rise to the charge of arson against HEK.

14Mariam went to the assistance of his injured brother and then left the scene at high speed in the Honda. By this time police had been called, and were on the scene. Two police vehicles pursued the Honda. Mariam threw the Ruger from the vehicle. It was later recovered, its magazine empty. The Honda was recovered from an address near Mariam's home. The rear window and rear passenger window were broken. This damage was not caused by gunshots, but by blunt or straight edged implements. Implements meeting that description - a piece of timber and a Stillson wrench - were found in the white van. It was an obvious inference, as proposed by the Crown, that members of the HEK group had used those weapons to attack the Honda. What is not clear is at what point that attack occurred.

15Mariam was arrested at his home the following day.

16That defence of self-defence having been raised by Elkobaili, by s 419 of the Crimes Act 1900, an onus was cast upon the Crown to prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that Elkobaili did not believe that his conduct was necessary to defend himself or another person (see s 418(2)(a) of the Crimes Act). The verdicts establish that the Crown failed to discharge that onus. The implication of these verdicts is part of the matters raised in Mariam's application for leave to appeal against the sentence. 

17Mariam did not participate in any interview with police after his arrest. He did not provide any statement or other information. He did not give evidence in the trial. Accordingly, his response to the Crown case may only be discerned from the manner in which prosecution witnesses were cross-examined, and what was put to the jury by his counsel in final address. That response was (notwithstanding his earlier offers of a plea of guilty to manslaughter) that Mariam was not involved in the incident, did not have possession of a firearm, and did not fire the shots. In those circumstances, he did not seek a direction on manslaughter as an alternative verdict. No question of self-defence (or defence of another) was ever raised on Mariam's behalf.

18In accordance with the decision of the High Court in The Queen v Pemble [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107, Latham J left the alternative of manslaughter to the jury. The basis of the direction was death caused by an unlawful and dangerous act, carried out with an appreciable risk of serious injury. (It may be that other bases for the alternative verdict were left, but it was accepted, for the purposes of sentencing, that manslaughter by unlawful and dangerous act was the basis for the verdict.) It was accepted, for the purpose of sentencing, that it was Mariam who fired the shot that killed Mr Knight.

The Remarks on Sentence

19For the purposes of sentencing, it was necessary that Latham J determine the relevant facts. In doing so, she was entitled to have regard to the whole of the evidence in the trial. She was, of course, confined to finding facts not inconsistent with the jury's verdict. Given that three accused were on trial, and given the disparate verdicts, that involved an exercise of some complexity.

20In particular, her Honour was constrained by Mariam's acquittal of the murder charge to proceed on the basis that, in discharging the pistol on the occasion that he fired the shot that killed Mr Knight, Mariam did not intend either to kill or to occasion grievous bodily harm to anybody. Although it may be thought that this entailed an exercise in mental gymnastics, and although there are difficulties with reconciling that verdict with the now uncontested facts, Latham J did precisely that, and this Court must do the same.

21Her Honour recounted the events as I have set them out above. At a point in the Remarks on Sentence where her Honour had noted the arrival of the white van containing the HEK group, and the high beam headlights signal from the Honda, her Honour said:

""8 Almost immediately, [Mariam] began shooting at the opposing group. He repeatedly discharged his firearm in a generally southerly direction. As many as ten cartridges were fired indiscriminately in a matter of minutes ... Other occupants of the van, who had commenced to assault the occupants of the Honda before they realised they were under fire, took cover."" (italics added)

22Her Honour then considered the implications of the acquittal of Elkobaili, saying:

""10 It is relevant to note that the jury acquitted Adel Elkobaili of all offences, including affray, and that the only way in which those verdicts can be reconciled with the guilty verdicts returned against [Mariam] is on the basis that the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Adel Elkobaili was not acting in self defence. The corollary of that proposition is that the jury found as a fact that Mahmoud Mariam was the first to discharge a firearm. That finding appears to me to be consistent with an acceptance by the jury that the combined actions of the Mariam group constituted a form of ambush, to which Adel Elkobaili responded. [Mariam], through his counsel, accepts that he is to be sentenced on the basis that he was responsible for the death of Mr Knight by the unlawful and dangerous discharge of the pistol in the circumstances I have outlined."" (italics added)

Her Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that:

""11 ... the deliberate and repeated firing of a firearm in a public place with a view to furthering a conflict between two groups of young men in which [Mariam] played no part ... [Mariam] took the loaded firearm with the intention of using it, albeit not necessarily with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm or death on any person. The fact remains however, that all of [Mariam's] actions on the night in question were demonstrative of a premeditated plan to surprise the members of the opposing group with a pre-emptive show of force.""

On the basis of these findings, she considered the objective gravity of the manslaughter offence to be ""high"".

23In the light of these findings, her Honour considered that, although the affray offence was ""a particularly serious example"" of offences of its kind, there was very little additional criminality represented by the commission of that offence, notwithstanding that the circumstances of the affray presented considerable risk to members of the public. (In coming to this view, her Honour undoubtedly had in mind the high degree of commonality in the facts that gave rise to the manslaughter offence, and the facts that constituted the affray offence.)

24She noted Victim Impact Statements presented by Mr Knight's son and daughter and the limitations placed on the use of such material for sentencing purposes: R v Previtera [1997] 94 A Crim R 76.

25Of the offence itself, her Honour said:

""13 Notwithstanding that the events outlined above took place over a relatively short period of time (including the discharge of firearms over a matter of minutes), it bore all the hallmarks of a complete disregard for, indeed a contempt for, the rule of law."",

and, of Mariam:

""14 ... it remains true to say that [Mariam] himself has at no stage expressed the slightest remorse for the death of Mr Knight. He chose to place evidence of his personal circumstances before the Court in the form of an affidavit, as was his right, yet nowhere did he address the consequences of his offending, other than the impact it had on himself and his family.""

26She noted Mariam's personal circumstances. He was born in Lebanon in 1983. He was 26 years of age at the time of the offences, almost 29 at sentencing. His parents came to Australia in 1978, and have operated a car repair business in Bankstown. Mariam is the second of five sons in the family. He is married with two children. He had worked in his father's panel beating business. Although Latham J noted a letter to the Court written by Mariam's wife detailing hardship caused to her and her children by the incarceration of her husband, it was not suggested that the hardship was such as to justify any mitigation in sentence for that reason: see R v Edwards [1996] 90 A Crim R 510.

27Her Honour noted Mariam's criminal history, which was of relatively minor significance, although it did include two counts of armed robbery (committed as a juvenile, in respect of which he was given the benefit of non-custodial dispositions) and a driving offence committed during his flight from the scene of the offences presently under consideration.

28Her Honour then turned her attention to relevant sentencing principles, saying:

""21 The circumstances of these offences demand considerable emphasis on the principle of general deterrence. Specific deterrence also has some limited significance, in view of [Mariam's] criminal history and the absence of any evidence of his capacity for insight into his behaviour. To my observation, he wears his contempt for the law as a badge of honour. I therefore regard his prospects of rehabilitation as moderate at best. The aggregate punishment to be imposed for the offences of manslaughter and affray must, in my view, reflect the fact that [Mariam] was a mature adult who consciously and arrogantly engaged in the most mindless display of violence in the presence of a number of much younger men and vulnerable members of the public."" (italics added)

She then imposed the sentences set out above.

The severity appeal

29As mentioned above, only one ground was advanced in support of the proposed severity appeal. It asserts error in the sentencing judge's determination of the facts. So to frame as a ground of appeal is hardly enlightening or informative.

30Written submissions filed in support of the application purport to identify two aspects of the fact finding that are challenged. They are stated as:

""(a) The findings made by the sentencing judge with respect to the events occurring at the time that [Mariam] fired his gun (see [8]) and 

(b) [Mariam's] state of mind in taking the loaded firearm to the location where it was discharged (see [10]).""

31These cast little more light on Mariam's case than the pleaded ground. The first appears to be directed to the finding in para [8] of the Remarks on Sentence (extracted above) that the shooting by Mariam began ""almost immediately"" on the signal from the Honda. From this, it was suggested that her Honour found as a fact that Mariam fired before any assault had been made by the HEK group. The written submissions filed on behalf of Mariam characterised that as the ""critical"" question. It is important to note that, in oral submissions, senior counsel for Mariam accepted that Mariam had been the first to discharge a firearm. What he urged was a finding of fact that he did so only after the occupants of the van, the HEK group, had begun an armed attack on the Honda containing his two brothers.

32In may be true that the last sentence of para [8] of the Remarks on Sentence could be interpreted as implying that the HEK group were ""under fire"" at a point before they had commenced their assault on the Honda. Counsel who appeared for Mariam at trial expressly accepted that proposition when it was put to him by her Honour during the sentencing proceedings. Senior counsel on appeal now contends that that concession was ""inappropriate"" and an ""error of law"". I pause to note that, if it is an error at all, it is an error of fact. Nor was it an ""inappropriate"" concession. All of the evidence pointed to the conclusions, explicitly reached by her Honour, that ""the combined actions of the Mariam group constituted a form of ambush ..."", and that Mariam's own actions on the night ""were demonstrative of a premeditated plan to surprise the members of the opposing group with a pre-emptive show of force"".

33Although not conceding that Mariam fired the pistol before the HEK group began an assault on the Honda, during the hearing in this Court, senior counsel accepted that the evidence established that he was the first to discharge a firearm. Senior counsel submitted that the factual finding that should have been made was that, by the time Mariam discharged the firearm:

""... there had been a forcible assault with weapons on the vehicle [in] which [Mariam's] two younger brothers were sitting.""

This Court was referred to no evidence to support such a finding. Indeed, to the very limited extent to which this Court was referred to any evidence, it is consistent with the proposition that the gunshots began as soon as the occupants of the van alighted from it. The most obvious conclusion is that the attacks began virtually simultaneously, although it was Mariam who first fired a shot.

34The now uncontested facts are that Mariam attended the scene armed with a loaded firearm; that, on a signal from the Honda, he walked towards the HEK van; and that he fired the pistol no fewer than ten times. He was present, in possession of a loaded firearm, for the purpose of a violent confrontation. That constitutes the affray. The consequence of one of those shots fired by him was the death of Mr Knight. That constitutes the manslaughter. Mariam did not seek, in the slightest way, to make a case that his discharge of the pistol was a response to an assault on the Honda. A conclusion that it was would be pure speculation. 

35The second aspect of the fact finding that was challenged was said to be Mariam's ""state of mind"" in taking the loaded firearm to the place where the confrontation was to take place. The submissions were directed to the findings that:

""... the combined actions of the Mariam group constituted a form of ambush""

and that Mariam took the loaded firearm with him with the intention of using it in a ""pre-emptive show of force"".

36These conclusions, it was argued, were not open, and were based on the same (said to be erroneous) conclusion that Mariam fired the pistol before the assault on the Honda had begun. For the reasons given above, the conclusion that Mariam was, with his cohorts, present to ""ambush"" the HEK group was one that was well open to her Honour.

37A separate proposition, not reflective of anything in the grounds of appeal, found its way into the written and oral submissions. It was that (presumably as a matter of law): 

""... it was an error to place any reliance at all on the jury's verdict in respect of Elkobaili, for the simple reason that the jury's verdict was in respect of him, not [Mariam], and because it was in circumstances where he was to receive the benefit of any reasonable doubt."" (Mariam's written submissions)

In oral submissions, it was put that Latham J failed to make appropriate factual findings because she felt constrained by Elkobaili's acquittal, which was ""a misconception of the law"".

38As I have mentioned, no such error as is now asserted was the subject of any ground of application for leave to appeal. The proposition amounts to assertion of significant legal error. If accepted, it may have far-reaching consequences. To the best of my knowledge, it has not previously been put to this Court that, in the necessary fact finding exercise following a joint trial, a judge is required to disregard the implications of divergent jury verdicts.

39No authority was cited for the proposition. Although it had a passing mention in the written submissions, no proper or adequate notice was given to the Director that it was to be advanced. This Court is in no position to make a definitive ruling on the validity of the proposition. 

40Notwithstanding the absence of any cogent argument to support the proposition, it seems to me to be untenable. A joint trial is precisely that - a joint trial. The evidence, in general, was evidence against all three accused: to the extent (if any, and none has been identified) that any evidence was admissible against only one (or more) accused, no complaint is made that appropriate directions were not given. The acquittal of Elkobaili had obvious implications for the fact finding exercise with respect to Mariam. The inferences drawn by her Honour were open and appropriate.

41I would reject the challenge to the sentencing judge's findings of fact. Although I would grant leave to appeal, I would therefore dismiss the appeal against sentence.

The Crown appeal

42I have set out above the three grounds raised on behalf of the Director. They concern:


the accumulation of the sentences;


the weight given to specific deterrence;


manifest inadequacy. 

(i) Accumulation

43As set out above, the sentence for manslaughter was accumulated by only 3 months on the sentence for affray. It is the Director's submission that this degree of accumulation was inadequate to reflect the objective gravity of the two offences.

44Since the sentence for affray expired on 23 April 2013, during the currency of the manslaughter sentence (the non-parole period of which expires on 23 April 2016), the effect of the commencement date of the manslaughter sentence is that Mariam will serve only three months in custody specifically referable to the affray offence. It is that that the Director, by this ground, contends is inadequate.

45Two things are to be borne in mind in considering this issue. The first is that her Honour found that the affray offence was, of itself, a ""particularly serious"" instance of offences of its type. At the same time, having regard to the whole of the circumstances, her Honour said that the additional criminality represented by the commission of the affray was very limited. That was because there was a considerable degree of commonality in the circumstances appertaining to the two offences. Her Honour was accordingly careful to avoid any ""double counting"" in sentencing.

46The degree of accumulation to be included in sentencing for multiple offences is, generally speaking, a discretionary matter. As with all discretionary decisions, such a decision is reviewable on the principles stated in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499. Error may be identifiable by mistake of fact, failure to take into account some material consideration, or taking into account immaterial or extraneous considerations. Error may also be identifiable by inference - where the result is ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".

47I have concluded that there is merit in the Director's submission. Notwithstanding the degree of commonality in the circumstances of the two offences, they were, nevertheless, separate and distinct offences. As her Honour correctly observed, the affray was a particularly serious instance of the offence. It involved as many as eleven men, with violence as their predominant intention. That Mariam was armed as he was is highly indicative of the level of his personal involvement in the confrontation. That he discharged as many as ten shots from his firearm emphasises the level of that participation.

48That Mr Knight's death was caused as an incident of the affray does not have the effect that the manslaughter is entirely entwined with the affray, such as to reduce the need for adequate criminal punishment of each offence. Mr Knight was not part of the affray. He was an entirely innocent, uninvolved, passer by.

49In my opinion, the accumulation of three months failed adequately to meet the need for each sentence to reflect the criminality involved in the offence to which it relates. I am satisfied that error of the House kind has been established. The error is in failing to ensure that the overall sentence adequately recognised the totality of criminality involved: see, for example, Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [27]. I propose that the manslaughter sentence commence on 24 April 2011, an accumulation of 12 months.

(ii) Specific deterrence 

50Although her Honour placed considerable emphasis on the need for the sentences to contain an element of general deterrence, she also considered that:

""21 ... specific deterrence also has some limited significance, in view of [Mariam's] criminal history and the absence of any evidence of his capacity for insight into his behaviour. To my observation, he wears his contempt for the law as a badge of honour. I therefore regard his prospects of rehabilitation as moderate at best.""

51In the light of those findings, it is difficult to see why the significance of specific deterrence was limited. I accept the Director's submission that this was a case that called for substantial weight to be placed on specific deterrence. Mariam was 26 years of age at the time of the offence, almost 29 at sentencing. It was at the time of sentencing that the judge found that he wore ""his contempt for the law as a badge of honour"", and had no capacity for insight into his behaviour. Those findings point to a very real and significant need for the sentences to incorporate specific deterrence. 

(iii) Manifest inadequacy 

52The error identified above (inadequate weight given to specific deterrence) is sufficient to establish that the sentences were deficient in the failure to take into account an important element of sentencing. 

53The question remains whether, leaving that error aside, either sentence was, or the two in aggregate were, manifestly inadequate in the sense envisaged in the last of the House principles. In this consideration, it is necessary to look at the starting point of the manslaughter sentence before the reduction allowed in respect of the tendered plea of guilty - that is, a sentence of 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months. The Director does not take issue with the quantification of the reduction for the proffered plea of guilty. It does not appear that any reduction was allowed in respect of the sentence for the affray, and none would have been appropriate.

54It is true that many of the circumstances that make the affray offence a serious example of its kind, and that render the objective gravity of the manslaughter as ""high"" are the same. There is overlap. But that does not mean that those circumstances can be disregarded in the assessment of the objective gravity of either offence.

55Aggravating features applicable to both offences were that they involved the actual use of a weapon (s 21A(2)(c) of the Sentencing Procedure Act) and that they were committed without regard to public safety (s 21A(2)(i)). The affray was aggravated by the degree of planning and organisation (s 21A(2)(n)).

56There could be no rational challenge (and there was none) to the categorisation of the objective gravity of each offence.

57Neither counsel identified any relevant comparable manslaughter sentences, or sentencing patterns. That was for the very valid reason that, as is well recognised, manslaughter offences are so variable as to make comparison difficult. Nor were any comparable sentences for affray provided. That may have been because of the high level of seriousness of this affray.

58Her Honour did not say whether she set the period of the fixed term sentence for the affray at the level of what would otherwise have been the non-parole period or the total term. The predominant view has favoured the former but it is not a uniform approach and it has been questioned: Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [56]-[62]; TDP v R; R v TDP [2013] NSWCCA 303 at [172]. Having regard to the sentence imposed upon some of the co-offenders in this matter for affray, it seems clear enough that her Honour had regard to a notional head sentence of 4 years before setting the fixed term at 3 years. In my opinion, adopting the approach that the fixed term in this case represents what would have been the non-parole period, the sentence should be one of 4 years. That would represent a head sentence of 5 years and 4 months.

59Equally, against a maximum sentence allowable of 25 years for the manslaughter, a starting point of 9 years was manifestly inadequate. A starting point of 14 years is appropriate. That must be reduced by the 15 per cent allowed in recognition of the proffered pleas of guilty, yielding a sentence of 12 years. Application of the s 44(2) ratio gives a non-parole period of 9 years. Special circumstances should be found because of the partial accumulation of the sentence so that the non-parole component of the overall term will accord with the s 44(2) ratio. To achieve that, the non-parole period should be reduced to 8 years 9 months and the parole period increased by the same extent.

60In my opinion, the Director has discharged the onus of establishing that each sentence was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"".

61Against that possibility, Mariam filed an affidavit sworn the day before the application was listed for hearing. He expressly accepted his responsibility for Mr Knight's death and said that this discovery had ""horrified"" him. He said ""this was the worst possible thing"", and that he ""struggle[s] every day with this knowledge"" of what he had done. The affidavit was no doubt provided with a view to countering the express observation by Latham J that Mariam had shown no evidence of remorse. It appears to have been drafted with the provision of s 21A(3)(i) in mind, to establish a mitigating circumstance. 

62Mariam was cross-examined. He said that he had accepted that he was responsible for the death, but that he had been instructed by his legal team not to communicate with Mr Knight's family in order to express his remorse or to apologise. He said that he remained ""shattered"" and ""devastated"" for Mr Knight's family, for his own family, and for everybody involved.

63For my part, Mariam's expressions of remorse rang hollow. I do not accept them as genuine.

64In any event, although it is well established that remorse may be taken into account as a mitigating factor in sentencing, some attention needs to be paid to the logic of doing so. Genuine remorse may be an indicator of the unlikelihood of further offending, in which case it may have significant relevance. If it is not indicative of that likelihood, I see little relevance in such evidence. There was nothing in Mariam's evidence, affidavit or oral, that persuaded me that his expressions of remorse should be taken as indicative that he is unlikely to re-offend. The findings of fact by Latham J point in the opposite direction. With respect to Mariam's personal circumstances, nothing additional to what was contained in Latham J's Remarks on Sentence was put.

65This Court retains a discretion to decline to interfere following an appeal by the Director, even where the grounds are made out. No evidence relevant to the exercise of the discretion was adduced, and no argument advanced that the discretion ought to be exercised. I would decline to do so.

66I propose the following orders:

(1)(i) Leave to appeal against sentence granted;

(ii) Appeal dismissed;

(2)(i) Director's appeal against sentence allowed;

(ii) Each sentence set aside and in lieu thereof Mahmoud Mariam sentenced as follows:


with respect to the conviction for affray, Mahmoud Mariam is sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of 4 years, commencing on 24 April 2010, and expiring on 23 April 2014;


with respect to the conviction for manslaughter, Mahmoud Mariam is sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 years 9 months commencing on 24 April 2011 with a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 years 3 months expiring on 23 April 2023. The earliest date the offender will be eligible for release on parole will be on the expiration of the non-parole period on 23 January 2020.

		03 January 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705644,R v TD [2013] NSWCCA 337,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J.

2SIMPSON J: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director"") against a ruling by Jeffreys DCJ on 5 September 2013, refusing to admit certain evidence proposed to be led by the Crown in a criminal trial. Such an appeal is permitted where the ruling ""eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case"": Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F(3A). There is no issue in this case that the ruling in question is of that character. This Court accordingly has jurisdiction to hear and determine the appeal.

3The issues raised on the appeal concern an Authority issued under the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (""the LE(CO) Act""). 

The Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997

4The long title of the LE(CO) Act is:

""An Act with respect to the authorisation, conduct and monitoring of certain operations conducted by law enforcement agencies; and for other purposes.""

5The LE(CO) Act was introduced into the NSW Parliament following the decision of the High Court in Ridgeway v The Queen [1995] HCA 66; 184 CLR 19. In Ridgeway, the accused was charged with and convicted of an offence against Commonwealth law of possession of a prohibited import (heroin). The importation of the heroin had been facilitated by Malaysian Police with the active cooperation of the Australian Federal Police, in what was termed a ""controlled operation"". There was no statutory authorisation for such an operation, which involved Australian law enforcement authorities committing, or participating in, the criminal offence of importation of a prohibited narcotic. By a 6-1 majority, the High Court held that evidence of Ridgeway's possession of the heroin was inadmissible. Five members of the High Court reached this conclusion on the basis that the evidence was inadmissible on grounds of public policy; Gaudron J, on the ground that, by illegally importing the heroin, AFP officers had incited or participated in the commission of the offence with which the accused was charged, rendering the proceedings against him an abuse of process.

6The LE(CO) Act was devised as a means of authorising operations such as the ""controlled operation"" in which Ridgeway was unwittingly involved. It was recognised that a clear line had to be drawn between authorisation of an operation that, on the one hand, might involve the commission of what would otherwise be criminal offences by law enforcement officers (or civilians acting in tandem with law enforcement officers) for the purpose of obtaining evidence of offences that would, at least probably, have been committed in any event; and, on the other hand, inciting or inducing the commission of an offence or offences that would not, absent the incitement or inducement, have been committed. With that balance in mind, the NSW Parliament enacted the LE(CO) Act. 

7The LE(CO) Act identifies five separate law enforcement agencies to which it applies, and nominates their various heads as, for the purposes of the LE(CO) Act, Chief Executive Officers. The NSW Police Force is one such law enforcement agency. The LE(CO) Act permits those CEOs to issue Authorities to conduct controlled operations. The process is tightly regulated. 

8By s 5 of the LE(CO) Act, a law enforcement officer of a nominated law enforcement agency (including NSW Police Force) may apply to the CEO of that agency for an Authority to conduct a ""controlled operation"". A ""controlled operation"" is defined as meaning an operation conducted for the purpose of:

""(a) obtaining evidence of criminal activity or corrupt conduct, or
(b) arresting any person involved in criminal activity or corrupt conduct, or
(c) frustrating criminal activity or corrupt conduct, or
(d) carrying out an activity that is reasonably necessary to facilitate the achievement of any purpose referred to in paragraph (a), (b) or (c),
being an operation that involves, or may involve, a controlled activity.""

""Controlled activity"" is defined as: 

""... an activity that, but for section 16, would be unlawful.""

9By s 6 of the LE(CO) Act, the CEO of the agency may refuse the application, or may grant the Authority, either unconditionally or subject to conditions. By s 6(2) an Authority may not be granted unless a code of conduct is prescribed by the regulations in relation to the agency in question.

10Further, the CEO of the agency is required, by s 6(3), to be satisfied as to certain specified matters, and, by sub-s (4), to have regard to certain specified matters before granting an Authority. 

11Section 7 (particularly s 7(1)) is an important provision, and has particular relevance to the present appeal. Section 7(1) is in the following terms:

""(1) An authority to conduct a controlled operation must not be granted in relation to a proposed operation that involves any participant in the operation: 
(a) inducing or encouraging another person to engage in criminal activity or corrupt conduct of a kind that the other person could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so induced or encouraged, or
(b) engaging in conduct that is likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant, or any other person, or to result in serious loss or damage to property, or
(c) engaging in conduct that involves the commission of a sexual offence against any person.""

Section 7(1)(a) gives effect to recognition of the distinction mentioned above - the goal being to obtain evidence of offences that would, even without the controlled operation, have been committed, but to avoid conduct that would itself provoke the commission of an offence or offences that would not otherwise have been considered.

12Section 8 specifies the form which an Authority must take, and requires the inclusion of certain specified information. Of particular relevance to the present appeal, sub-s (2) of s 8 requires that the Authority must identify the nature of the controlled activities in which the proposed ""law enforcement participants"" may engage. A ""law enforcement participant"" in an authorised operation is a participant in the operation who is a law enforcement officer (s 3). ""Law enforcement officers"" include police officers (s 3).

13By s 13 the effect of an Authority is to authorise each law enforcement participant to engage in the identified controlled activities; by s 13A procedural defects do not invalidate any application for or grant of an Authority, other than those that affect the substance of the application. 

14Section 16 is in the following terms:

""Despite any other Act or law, an activity that is engaged in by a participant in an authorised operation in the course of, and for the purposes of, the operation is not unlawful, and does not constitute an offence or corrupt conduct, so long as it is authorised by, and is engaged in in accordance with, the authority for the operation."" (italics added)

The italicised words are important. Section 16 affords protection to participants in authorised criminal activities, but only to the extent of the Authority. Departures from the authorised activity do not attract the protection of s 16.

By s 3 an ""authorised operation"" is:

""... a controlled operation for which an authority is in force ...""

15At the relevant time the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Regulation 2007 (now replaced by the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Regulation 2012) contained, in Sch 2, a code of conduct applicable (by cl 10 of the Regulation), to all law enforcement agencies, including the NSW Police Force. Relevantly, cl 5 of the code of conduct provided:

""Each law enforcement participant in an authorised operation must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the conduct of the operation does not involve any participant in the operation: 
(a) inducing or encouraging another person to engage in criminal activity or corrupt conduct of a kind that the other person could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so induced or encouraged, or
(b) engaging in conduct that is likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant, or any other person, or to result in serious loss or damage to property, or
(c) engaging in conduct that involves the commission of a sexual offence against any person, or
(d) engaging in any activity that, not being a controlled activity, is unlawful.""

It will be seen that, to a substantial extent, cl 5 of the code of conduct replicates s 7(1) of LE(CO) Act, and reinforces the distinction between operations designed to produce evidence of criminal activity, and those which go beyond evidence gathering and themselves provoke the commission of criminal offences.

Background

16In early May 2012 it came to the attention of Detective Senior Constable Daniel Peverill of the NSW Police Force that the respondent had been making inquiries about having her former partner (BV) murdered. BV is the father of the respondent's young son. On 19 May 2012 Detective Senior Constable Peverill applied, pursuant to s 5 of the LE(CO) Act, for an Authority to conduct a controlled operation. (No issue arises concerning compliance with the requirements of s 5.) On the same day Assistant Commissioner Michael Fuller, with appropriate delegation, granted the application. Relevantly, the Authority contained the following:

""3. Having considered the Application, and any additional information furnished under s 5(3) of the Act, I am satisfied as to the following:

(a) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that criminal activity or corrupt conduct has been, is being or is about to be conducted in relation to matters within the administrative responsibility of the Agency, 

...

5. I am also satisfied as to the following:

(a) no participant will induce or encourage another person to engage in criminal activity or corrupt conduct of a kind that the other person could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so induced or encouraged, 

...

6. Pursuant to sections 6 and 8 of the Act, I authorise the following:

(a) Detective Senior Constable Daniel PEVERILL law enforcement officer within the meaning of the Act ... may conduct the controlled operation in accordance with the plan of the proposed operation accompanying the Application.

*(b) A law enforcement officer identified in column 1 of the Table below (an authorised law enforcement participant)* may engage in controlled activities of the nature specified opposite that participant in column 2 of the Table for the purposes of the controlled operation:





Name of participant

Nature of controlled activities


UCO535
UCO458

conspiring, agreeing, soliciting, encouraging, persuading, or endeavouring to persuade, or proposing to any person to commit the murder of [BV] by [TD], and any other person associated in the commission of the said criminal activity and includes entering and remaining on inclosed lands where necessary.""

""UCO535"" and ""UCO458"" were both undercover police officers.

17At 12.15pm on 20 May 2012, the law enforcement officer designated as ""UCO535"", after being briefed by Detective Senior Constable Peverill, drove to the home of the respondent in Mathoura, NSW. There he met the respondent and had a conversation with her. Part of the conversation took place in a motor vehicle en route to and at a different location. The conversation was electronically recorded and monitored by Detective Senior Constable Marc Azzi.

18Later that day (1.42pm) UCO535 attended a further briefing with Detective Senior Constable Peverill. At 2.50pm he met the respondent again and had a further conversation with her. This conversation was also electronically recorded, and was again monitored by Detective Azzi. During the course of this conversation, the respondent handed to UCO535 three sheets of paper. One was a coloured photocopy of a photograph of a male, who the respondent identified as BV. Another was a photocopy of a photograph of two cars parked in a car park. A male and female were depicted standing next to one of the cars. The respondent wrote on this document noting certain location and streets, and a residence in a Melbourne suburb. The third page was a photocopy of a sports boat club newsletter, on which the respondent wrote an address that she told UCO535 was that of BV. She wrote a date of birth that she said was BV's date of birth, and a mobile telephone number that she said was that of BV, and a number of other names.

19The recordings of the two conversations were transcribed. The recordings constitute the evidence that was ruled by Judge Jeffreys to be inadmissible. 

20Having regard to the basis on which the evidence was ruled inadmissible, it is necessary to set out, in some detail, the contents of the conversations. The extracts from the conversations are taken from transcripts which were in evidence, the accuracy of which was not disputed.

21At the first meeting of UCO535 and the respondent, at the respondent's home, the respondent's young son was also present. UCO535 ascertained the name of the respondent, and introduced himself under an assumed name. The respondent suggested that they might go for a walk. He ascertained that the respondent knew what he was there for, at which she expressed some concern. He then told her:

""The boys have sent me down, so they've sent me down, so, to have a chat with you.""

22There followed some apparently innocuous conversation, apparently about the respondent's home. It appears that they then drove off, at the direction of the respondent. The respondent told UCO535 that BV had used amphetamines, he had shown pornography in the presence of children, and had abused and sexually abused her son. UCO535 then asked:

""Do you need something, or what can I do for you?""

The respondent replied:

""I don't know, I actually don't know what you can do, like, I ultimately, this, you know, the way I feel ultimately I feel like the guy needs to have an overdose and disappear ... but I also am really aware that the finger will point to me straight away.""

A little later the respondent said:

""So, I don't, I'd love the bloke to disappear and leave this little boy alone. Umm, Leave us alone.""

UCO535 then said:

""That's, that's why I'm here. If you need something done I need you to tell me what you need done. If you, what you need done.""

At an early stage, the respondent said:

""... How, I suppose I don't really need to know, but how, how do, like you knock him off, how do you, how do you get over it not, like I don't want to know, I don't want to know how it happens or when it happens or, but how do you feel at ease with any of it?""

23On numerous occasions UCO535 placed the ball squarely in the respondent's court to identify what she was seeking to have done to BV. He raised the issue of remuneration and said that that would depend upon what the respondent wanted done. The respondent said that money was a problem and there was some discussion about ""price"", with UCO535 again saying that price was dependent upon what the respondent wanted done. The respondent said:

""I can imagine that it's a high price for what I have just said to 'do him in', that is a high price, I can imagine.""

The following exchange then occurred:

""UCO535: It depends, it depends. See, your words, 'do him in', could be different things in my world.

Respondent: I, overdosing, meaning death ... is that what 'doing in' means? I don't know.

UCO535: It depends, you know what I mean. Doing in, doing him in could mean a few things, you know what I mean.""

24The respondent then raised the prospect of ""scaring"" BV, in a way that would prevent him from having anything to do with her son until her son was of an age when he might, of his own initiative, seek to find his father. UCO535 asked if she had spoken to BV. The respondent said that this was not possible because of BV's behaviour. The following exchange then occurred:

""UCO535: You need to spell it out to me what you want done, and that way I can then say, All right, this is how much it's going to cost you. And I'm not going to tell you how I'm actually going to do it, but this is what I need from you ---

for me to get the job done.

Respondent: OK.

UCO535: You know what I mean? Things like, for example, that's what I'm saying, you need to tell me what you need done.

Respondent: I need him to back off, I need him to leave it alone ...

Yeah. Is that enough?

UCO535: What do you what done but?

Respondent: I know.

UCO535: What do you want done?

Respondent: I don't know. How do you, how do you make him back off?

UCO535: Like, you've already told me you want him to OD, you know what I mean.

Respondent: Well, that's my only, that's the only way I know how to back off ...

People around here look and see, watching seeing what you're doing, yeah. How do you get people to back off? What, you break their legs? Yeah, I don't know what you do. What do you do?

...

UCO535: I can't give you that advice. The reason why I can't give your that advice because, for example, me ... 

Respondent: If you went a broke his legs and he didn't back off then, is that what you're saying?

UCO535: No, no, it's solely up to you, you know what I mean. Whatever you decide to do, I'm happy to do. But I'm saying, I need you to tell me what you need done and that way I can then start planning, like, basic things like, for example, photos, address --- phone numbers, who does he hang out with, you know what I mean. What pubs he go to, all those sort of things ... then I can start doing a bit of homework ... because at the end of the day, mate, I don't give a fuck about him. 

...

Respondent: I can't give you specifically what I, all I want him to do is to leave us alone and not go through courts anymore, leave us completely alone until [my son] is 18, if he wants to go and look for his father, he can. And this is it, if he doesn't then, if he doesn't back off then yes, I would like him to overdose. Is that possible, is that without giving you details?

...

Is that possible to do?

UCO535: Mate, to, to, to make the bloke overdose there's ways. There's ways of doing things, you know what I mean. 

...

UCO535: But the reality is, if you need something done I need you to tell me exactly, because the trouble is, if I start the ball rolling, you know what I mean, I don't go back ... I get it done. There's certain things etcetera."" 

25There was much more discussion in the same vein. The respondent again (more than once) expressed her preference for a drug overdose, and her desire for BV to leave her and her son alone. Despite numerous attempts by UCO535 to have the respondent explicitly commit to what she was engaging him to do, she withstood those attempts. At one stage, well into the conversation, she recognised that this was what UCO535 was doing, and asked if he was recording the conversation. He denied that. 

26There was more discussion of the mechanics of an overdose. The respondent expressed concern that, if all that was done to BV was that his legs were broken, he could retaliate against her. 

27After more discussion UCO535 told the respondent that she had three options. These he identified as:

""... talk, get rid of ... or walk away.""

The respondent immediately rejected the ""walk away"" option. She suggested, as alternative, having BV imprisoned. UCO535 made it clear that this was not a viable option. They reverted to the three options. The respondent said:

""That's the second option. It keeps coming back to the second option.""

The ""second option"" was ""to get rid of [BV]"".

UCO535 responded by saying that it was the respondent's decision. She said:

""I can't walk away.""

28They agreed that the respondent could take some time to consider her position and to meet again later in the day. 

29UCO535 drove the respondent back to her home; during the course of the drive there was further discussion. They concluded with this exchange:

""UCO535: And that way I can see are you serious, or aren't you serious, you know what I mean. Do you want to go on with it. And that's what I'm saying, at the end of the day it's your choice, you know what I mean? I'm not going to force you to do anything, I'm not going to tell you to do anything, you know what I mean? ... If you walk, walk away, you know what I mean, at the end of the day I just, I don't want you to give a contract to anyone else, and you've already said you're not, and that's it, you know what I mean, for me, I'm happy, whichever way, whichever way you decide.""

30UCO535 left the respondent at just after 1.40pm. The arrangement was that he would return to her premises at 3pm. This he did, after the briefing with Detective Peverill. The respondent gave him the photographs to which I have referred above and good deal of information about BV. UCO535 again asked her to specify what she wanted done. He said:

""The chances are all right, I think you're talking about option 1 what I spoke about, is that right?""

The respondent assented to that proposition. Option 1, it will be recalled, was ""talking"" to BV. There is no indication in the recorded conversations that the respondent had indicated a preference for that option. However, the respondent agreed with the proposition. UCO535 said:

""The chances are ... he's going to come back ... and get you. That, that, that's a chance ...""

31What followed should be extracted precisely. The transcript records:

""UCO535: All right. I'll be upfront with you, I'm not going to bullshit you ---

Respondent: No, and I don't want that. 

UCO535: Yeah. Option 2 ---

Respondent: mmm.

UCO535: --- is ---

Respondent: Is the only way.

UCO535: The only way, all right. If you say go for option 2 I'll do it but it's gunna cost.

Respondent: As you know ---

UCO535: Yeah.

Respondent: --- in the experience ---

UCO535: Yeah.

Respondent: --- of all the stuff that you've done ---

UCO535: Yeah.

Respondent: --- option 2 is the only way isn't it, or walk away? Option 2 is the only way.""

32There was then discussion about price and methods of payment. The conversation finished with the following:

""UCO535: All right. Today we haven't spoken, you've never seen me and that's it all right. 

Respondent: The others saw you.

UCO535: What was I there for?

Respondent: To help me with the building.

UCO535: Exactly right. Thank you. Thank you ... As I said Tanya I'll start the ball rolling, all right. 

Respondent: Don't worry I'm not gunna renig or anything ---

UCO535: Yeah.

Respondent: --- all that's ---

UCO535: All right. As I said you know when I drive away from here ---

Respondent: That's it.

UCO535: --- that's it ---

Respondent: Yep.

UCO535: All right. Take care, enjoy.

Respondent: Nothing's gunna come ---

UCO535: Nothing will come back on you, all right.""

33Shortly after this second conversation the respondent was arrested and charged with conspiracy to murder. She was taken into custody at the Deniliquin Police Station, where she was interviewed. That interview is not in evidence in the current proceedings.

The District Court proceedings

34The respondent's trial was fixed to commence on 2 September 2013 in the District Court at Griffith. Prior to empanelment of a jury, the legal representatives of the respondent sought, pursuant to s 189 of the Evidence Act 1995, that a voir dire be conducted into the admissibility of the evidence of the recorded conversations. Whether s 189 or s 130 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 was the appropriate enabling provision does not here need to be determined. In written submissions provided to Jeffreys DCJ, counsel for the respondent raised the following issues:


the validity or invalidity of the Authority granted by the Assistant Commissioner Fuller on 19 May 2012;


the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the conduct of Detective Peverill, UCO535 and Detective Azzi in the conversations with the respondent and the recording of those conversations.

35It was contended on the respondent's behalf that the Authority was invalid, and therefore did not authorise the activities of UCO535. In the alternative, it was contended that, even if the Authority were validly granted, the conduct of UCO535 and the other detectives did not comply with:


cl 3(a)(i) of the code of conduct; 
cl 5(a) of the code of conduct; 
s 7(1)(a) of the LE(CO) Act; 
s 16 of the LE(CO) Act.

It was therefore contended that the evidence was unlawfully or improperly obtained and ought not to be admitted having regard to s 138 of the Evidence Act.

36Detective Peverill and UCO535 gave oral evidence on the voir dire and were cross-examined. 

37On 5 September 2013 Jeffreys DCJ gave judgment. He held that the evidence was unlawfully obtained. Accordingly, having considered the provisions of s 138 of the Evidence Act, in the exercise of the discretion thereby conferred, he ruled that the evidence would not be admitted in the trial of the respondent.

38The precise means by which his Honour reached the conclusion that the evidence was unlawfully obtained is not entirely clear. His Honour considered s 7 of the LE(CO) Act to be ""a very important consideration"", and that the protection afforded by s 16 is only available to activity clearly authorised in accordance with the LE(CO) Act. He went on to conclude that UCO535 encouraged the respondent to engage in criminal activity that she could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so encouraged. Accordingly, he held, the activity of UCO535 went further than could be authorised and was therefore not protected by s 16. He held that, in considering the respondent's ""intentions"" he was confined to the evidence of the recording and could not have regard to the reasons underpinning the application for the grant of the Authority. That appears to be a reference to the evidence of Detective Peverill that he had secured information that the respondent was making inquiries into having BV murdered.

39In written submissions filed on behalf of the respondent in this Court, senior counsel sought to support the exclusion of the evidence. Her starting proposition was that the Authority was invalidly granted. This, she contended, was because the Authority purported, on its face, to authorise conduct that was expressly prohibited under the LE(CO) Act. The conduct said to meet that characterisation was;

""conspiring, agreeing, soliciting, encouraging, persuading or endeavouring to persuade, or proposing to any person to commit the murder of [BV] by [the respondent], and any other person associated in the commission of the said criminal activity ...""

Such authorisation was, so the argument ran, in breach of s 7(1)(a) of the LE(CO) Act. Moreover, senior counsel submitted, the conduct so authorised was in contravention of the code of conduct. 

40That contention cannot be accepted. Section 7 is concerned with and directed to the granting of an Authority. Section 7(1):

""... delimits the scope for any exercise of authority by a Chief Executive Officer."":

Gedeon v The Commissioner of the NSW Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; 236 CLR 120 at [46].

41The limitation is on the grant of an Authority involving any participant in the operation in any of the activities identified in paras (a), (b) and (c) of s 7(1).

42In considering whether an Authority is invalid by reason of failure to come within the limits imposed by s 7(1), it is necessary to have regard to the specific conduct that is authorised, but also to the CEO's declared satisfaction as to the other matters of which he or she is required, by s 6(3), to be satisfied, and the matters to which he or she is required, by s 6(4), to have regard. When recourse is had to the precise terms of the Authority issued in this case, it will be seen that Assistant Commissioner Fuller was satisfied that:

""No participant will induce or encourage another person to engage in criminal activity or corrupt conduct of a kind that the other person could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so induced or encouraged.""

The activity authorised under the heading of ""Nature of controlled activities"" in column 2 of cl 6 must be read in conjunction with that declaration of satisfaction. Accordingly, the Authority fell precisely within the terms of s 7.

43It is not clear that Jeffreys DCJ took the view that the Authority was, in the sense contended by senior counsel, invalidly granted, although there are pointers in that direction in the judgment.

44It seems to me, however, that the principal reason for determining that the evidence was unlawfully obtained was a conclusion of fact that UCO535, in his conversation with the respondent, encouraged her to engage in criminal activity that went beyond what she could reasonably have been expected to engage in absent that encouragement. The factual basis on which his Honour reached this conclusion was stated as:

""Between the first conversation and the second conversation the undercover operative had a briefing with his supervisor. The undercover operative's supervisor and Detective Peverill had listened to the conversations live. It is clear in my view that the undercover operative in the first conversation tended to raise difficulties and/or obstacles in relation to various options discussed other than the murder option. When I listen to the conversations it seems to me that the [respondent] raised options which were then as a consequence of the difficulties and/or obstacles indicated by the undercover operative effectively eliminated insofar as the [respondent] was concerned, and she was on a number of occasions returned to the murder option. The undercover operative in his evidence denied that his conversations with the [respondent] encouraged her to engage in criminal activity.""

The essential finding of fact was that, by his conduct, UCO535 actively encouraged or induced the respondent to engage in the criminal activity of soliciting murder; and that, in doing do, UCO535 crossed the line between obtaining evidence of criminal activity, and provoking or inducing criminal activity. That conduct was not protected by s 16, and was, accordingly, unlawful.

The factual conclusions on which that was based were not open on the evidence, and cannot be sustained. Indeed, senior counsel for the respondent did not attempt to support them. It is because of those factual conclusions that I have set out, at considerable length, the conversations. At all times UCO535 was assiduous in seeking to have the respondent identify what it was that she wanted him to do. It was the respondent who first, at an early stage, proposed a drug overdose. It is true that she was wary, until a relatively late stage in the conversations, of committing herself to the course of action to which she ultimately committed. But it is quite wrong to say that UCO535 ""tended to raise difficulties and/or obstacles"" in relation to options other than the murder option. It was therefore unsustainable to find, as his Honour in effect did, that the respondent's decision to participate in soliciting the murder of BV was brought about by UCO535's conduct, and would not, otherwise, have occurred.

45Moreover, despite his Honour disregarding evidence, other than that contained in the conversations, with respect to the respondent's intentions, the recordings were not the only relevant evidence with respect to the question of what conduct she would have engaged in. Detective Peverill's evidence was that he had become aware of the respondent making inquiries into having BV murdered. That evidence was not challenged and no objection was taken to it. It is a highly relevant piece of evidence in the consideration of kind of conduct the respondent would or might have engaged in absent any encouragement or inducement by UCO535.

46In my opinion the conclusion that the evidence was unlawfully obtained was not open and was wrong.

47I would add that the same conclusion follows in the event that an impropriety by reason of breach of the code of conduct were to be raised.

48Given the conclusion I have reached, there is no call to consider s 138 of the Evidence Act.

49The orders I propose are:

(i)The Director's appeal is upheld;

(ii)The ruling of the District Court that evidence of the conversations between UCO535 and the respondent not be admitted is vacated.

50HALL J: I agree with Simpson J.

		07 July 2015",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705652,Stojanovski v R [2013] NSWCCA 334,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J.

2SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of three sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Newcastle on 11 December 2012 following his pleas of guilty to three counts on a Court Attendance Notice. 

3The charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty were:

(i)two counts of supplying prohibited drugs (cannabis and methylamphetamine);

(ii)one count of possession or use of a prohibited weapon (a ""stun gun"") without a permit.

4By s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 the cannabis offence exposed the applicant to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years; by the same section, the methylamphetamine offence exposed the applicant to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years; and by s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 the prohibited weapon offence exposed him to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Procedure Act"") a standard non-parole period of 3 years is prescribed in respect of that offence.

5In respect of the charge of supply of methylamphetamine, Maiden DCJ imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 4 years, with a non-parole of 2 years, commencing on 11 January 2012; in respect of the offence of supply of cannabis, he imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 6 months, commencing on 11 October 2012, and therefore accumulated by 9 months on the previous sentence; in respect of the prohibited weapon charge, he imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years, also to commence on 11 October 2012. The overall sentence is therefore one of imprisonment for 4 years and 3 months, commencing on 11 January 2012 and expiring on 10 April 2016, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months expiring on 10 October 2014. In so structuring the aggregate sentence, his Honour found special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, justifying a variation in what would otherwise have been the statutory ratio of 75 per cent to 25 per cent between the total sentence and the non-parole period. The reasons given for the departure from the s 44(2) ratio were the applicant's demonstrated rehabilitation and his re-entry into the workforce, about which I will say more in due course.

6The manner in which the sentences were structured calls for some examination. The sentence for the methylamphetamine offence commenced on 11 January 2012; the non-parole period is to expire on 10 January 2014, the total term on 10 January 2016. The sentence for the cannabis offence commenced on 11 October 2012; the non-parole period is to expire on 10 April 2014, the total term on 10 April 2016. The sentence for the prohibited weapon offence commenced on 11 October 2012; the non-parole period is to expire on 10 October 2014, the total term on 10 October 2015. The effect of that structuring is that, so far as the non-parole periods are concerned, the period from 11 January 2012 to 10 October 2012 (9 months) is wholly referable to the methylamphetamine charge. The period from 11 October 2012 to 10 January 2014 encompasses all three sentences; the period from 11 October 2012 to 10 April 2014 (18 months) encompasses both the cannabis and the prohibited weapon sentences; and the period from 11 April 2014 to 10 October 2014 (6 months) is wholly referable to the prohibited weapon offence. There is no part of the non-parole periods that is solely referable to the cannabis offence. (With respect to the total terms, the last sentence to expire is that imposed in respect of the cannabis offence. There is a period of three months (11 January 2016 - 10 April 2016) referable to that sentence; otherwise, there is considerable overlap between the sentences.)

7The result is that, having regard only to the non-parole periods, the period to be spent in custody referable solely to the methylamphetamine charge is 9 months; the cannabis sentence is to be served wholly concurrently with one or the other of the other sentences; and the period to be spent in custody wholly referable to the prohibited weapon charge is 6 months.

The facts

8The facts were put before the sentencing judge by way of a detailed Agreed Statement. It may, despite its detail, be summarised succinctly.

9The drug offences were committed over a period beginning in mid-January 2011 and expiring in early May of that year. Put shortly, the applicant operated a drug supply business from his home in a suburb of Newcastle, using a mobile telephone. His wife, who was also charged, assisted (unwillingly) from time to time. The drugs were supplied in small quantities, usually suitable for use by the purchaser, although there were some occasions in which the quantities supplied or to be supplied were such as to suggest that the purchasers intended to resell. The operation was plainly a commercial one. The total quantity of drug supplied was never clearly identified.

10On 2 May 2011 police executed a search warrant at the applicant's home. Various items clearly associated with the drug dealing business were located. These included scales, smoking pipes, resealable plastic bags, a number of SIM cards, mobile telephones, cannabis leaf and methylamphetamine in crystal form. The applicant was in possession of $1,325 in cash. The ""stun gun"" was found at the bottom of a stairway among tools. 

11The applicant was arrested on the same day. He was eventually granted bail on 20 September of that year but not released until 5 October. 

The applicant's personal circumstances

12Evidence of the applicant's personal circumstances was given by him in sworn evidence, and via a number of reports, including one from Mr Sam Borenstein, a clinical psychologist. Other reports were from the Hunterlink Recovery Services, and the Glen Centre, an alcohol and other drug rehabilitation centre. From these, the following personal history emerged.

13The applicant was born in Macedonia in September 1964. He was 47 years of age at the time of the offending, 48 at sentencing. His family migrated to Australia in about 1967, when the applicant was three years of age, and lived in the Newcastle area. The applicant has two younger siblings. There were difficulties in his relationship with his father, who he described as ""strong headed, very strict"" and frequently physically abusive.

14The applicant did not attract adverse attention during his schooling. On leaving school he undertook and completed an apprenticeship in automotive engineering. He had stable employment in that capacity, and later as a bar manager.

15The applicant remained in the family home until he left, at the age of 27, to marry. He subsequently (in about 1993) purchased an orange juice run and became self-employed. As he gave his history to Mr Borenstein, during this time he was introduced to drugs. At the time of the offending, drug dealing was the applicant's sole source of income. He was not, and had not been for some years, in paid employment.

16The applicant's marriage is a successful and happy one, although his wife opposed his drug taking and drug dealing. There are two children of the marriage, now aged 19 and 15. The applicant's sister is also supportive, to the extent of offering financial security for bail on his arrest.

17The applicant has been drug dependent for about 20 years. The commencement of his drug use appears to have coincided with his becoming self-employed, and, also, perhaps, with the death of his father which appears to have been in about 1990. He began by smoking marijuana. He progressed to heroin and amphetamines. As a result he has served a number of terms of imprisonment, twice (1997, 2003) for drug supply offences; other offences on his record include driving while disqualified, malicious wounding, and being in possession of goods suspected of having been stolen.

18The applicant gave evidence concerning his possession of the ""stun gun"". He said that the weapon was given to him but never used by him and that he simply put it in a bag and left it there. He said he telephoned the owner who told him to keep it. He said he had not investigated whether it was operable or not.

19There was before the sentencing judge impressive evidence of rehabilitation. As mentioned above, the applicant remained in custody until released on bail on 5 October 2011 when he was admitted as an inpatient to the rehabilitation facility known as The Glen. He remained in that facility until January 2012, when he was discharged. The Assistant Co-ordinator of that Centre provided a very favourable report as to his rehabilitation. He said:

""[The applicant] has participated very well in all aspects of the program. The program includes morning groups, nightly AA and NA meetings, one-to-one counselling, work and chores and sports. [The applicant] also participated in anger management groups and parenting programs. [The applicant] has continually identified his family as a major motivator for him to change his life.

The counselling staff have been very happy with the amount of progress [the applicant] has made in his stay in our program. He has been quick to talk to counsellors when things have come up for him. 

He has consistently expressed a fear of returning home and he is under no illusions that it will not be easier to stay clean and sober ...""

20From The Glen the applicant went to another rehabilitation program conducted by the Hunterlink Recovery Services, and known as ""the Star"" program. It seems that this programme was somewhat less restrictive, in terms of the applicant's personal liberty, than that of The Glen. The Program Co-ordinator of that organisation also reported favourably, saying:

""Since his admission into the STAR program, [the applicant] appears to have gone from strength to strength in his personal recovery by maintaining his commitment to abstaining from drugs and alcohol, building/renovating his family home and gaining some employment. These achievements have seen some delays due to ill health and medical concerns; but [the applicant] continues to make permanent changes in his life for his future and the future of his family.

[The applicant] has almost completed the STAR program and has successfully addressed his addiction issues, which are directly related to the matters before your court ...""

21Mr Borenstein concurred in these two assessments. He diagnosed ""substance dependency"" which, he said, was ""in sustained full remission"". He said:

""[The applicant] has participated actively and conscientiously in rehabilitation. He is committed to remain on the path of abstinence. [The applicant] will require programs such as NA [Narcotics Anonymous] or the Twelve Step Program over many years, and quite likely his lifetime.""

He considered that the applicant could benefit from individual psychological intervention, associated with his early life and the issues concerning his father. 

22The applicant's own evidence confirmed the history he had given to Mr Borenstein, and the assessments made by the rehabilitation facilities. He was, at the time of sentencing, employed in a casual capacity in the local fishermen's co-operative.

23During the course of the sentencing proceedings, some attention was given to the level of objective gravity of the offences. In written submissions, the Crown put:

""7. The level of offending is above that of a user dealer or a street level dealer. They [the applicant and his wife] were operating a sophisticated business that involved some planning.

8. The level of offending places them slightly below the middle of the range for offences of this type.""

It is apparent from the context that these submissions were directed to both of the drug offences.

The Remarks on Sentence 

24The sentencing judge recounted the facts only briefly. With respect to the classification of objective gravity, he said:

""What is clear from the facts, that the operation that was being undertaken, as became known to the police, was of a longstanding commercial operation by a person well known in the community to whom was a person who was readily identifiable by persons who were users of drugs ...""

and

""In respect of the objective criminality, I do find that although he was a drug user and a person who was addicted to drugs, that there was a monetary benefit to him ...

... I find that in terms of his dealing that it is in what we might describe as the mid range, he was not one of the major dealers that I assume the police were looking for, but nonetheless he provided drugs to, and I assume, younger persons than he, which involved them in their addiction and one can easily assume in their criminal behaviours."" (italics added)

His Honour noted two features specifically relevant to the objective gravity of the offences. The first was that the operation was for financial reward. The second was the multiplicity of acts that constituted each of the two drug offences. Accordingly, he considered that authority demanded that he impose, having regard to both general and specific deterrence, a penalty ""that is well recognised and is severe"".

25With respect to rehabilitation, and notwithstanding the impressive evidence, his Honour was somewhat sceptical. He said:

""The Court does find that in respect of these matters that he has been released from his addictions at this point of time. However the Court is cognisant that he may, under pressure, at some point of time, revert to that behaviour and possibly re-offend in the future. The question that arises for the Court is how should that matter be taken into account, particularly in circumstances where the objective seriousness of these offences is severe."" (italics added)

26He turned to the explanation given by the applicant for his possession of the ""stun gun"", which he rejected. He considered that the weapon was:

""... there in case an eventuality presented itself where he may have need of such an item.""

He also considered it a possibility that it may have been used in exchange for drugs.

27His Honour made the finding of special circumstances (Sentencing Procedure Act, s 44(2)) to which I have already referred. He determined that, in recognition of the pleas of guilty, he would allow the applicant a reduction of 25 per cent on the sentences he otherwise would have imposed. 

28His Honour made reference to the periods of time that the applicant had spent in rehabilitation. While he did not expressly say that he intended to make an allowance for the period of quasi custody when the applicant was in residence at the Glen and the STAR, it is apparent that he did so. It is apparent because, although the applicant was at liberty on bail until the sentencing date (11 December 2012), the first of the sentences commenced on 11 January of that year. In other words, the sentence was backdated for almost 11 months. It is to be borne in mind that the applicant had also spent a period of 5 months in custody before being released on bail. Nevertheless, the allowance made was a generous one.

The application for leave to appeal

The grounds of the application

29Five grounds of the application were pleaded. They are:

""Ground 1: His Honour erred in determining the objective seriousness of the offending.

Ground 2: His Honour erred in failing to take into account the quantity of drugs involved in the supply offences.

Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to take into account the remorse shown by the offender.

Ground 4: His Honour erred in failing to consider the standard non-parole period when imposing the sentence for the weapons matter.

Ground 5: The sentence is manifestly excessive.""

On the hearing of the application, ground 4 was abandoned.

Ground 1: objective seriousness 

30The substance of the argument put on behalf of the applicant was not, strictly, that ""mid range"" was not an apt characterisation of the offending; rather, emphasis was placed upon the submission made by the Crown at sentencing which placed the offending at ""slightly below the middle of the range for offences of this type"". 

31Failure to accept this, it was submitted, at least in the absence of any signal that his Honour was giving consideration to departing from that assessment, amounted to a denial of procedural fairness. Reference was made to Cherdchoochatri v R [2013] NSWCCA 118; 277 FLR 126.

32In respect of this ground, some emphasis was also placed on the quantity, particularly of cannabis, that was the subject of that offence. 

33In my opinion this ground of the application cannot be sustained. The circumstances are very different from those that applied in Cherdchoochatri. In that case, the offender gave evidence of events that, if accepted, could have mitigated significantly his culpability for the offence. Although he was not cross-examined by the Crown (for reasons that are set out in that judgment) the sentencing judge, without notice to the offender, rejected the explanation.

34That is not this case. A sentencing judge is not bound to accept the Crown's assessment of the objective gravity of an offence. That assessment is a matter entirely within the judge's province. In any event, there is very little difference between ""slightly below the middle of the range"" and ""what we might describe as the mid range"". 

35When regard is had to the number of transactions, the period over which they took place, the fact that they were for monetary gain (as well as, and as a means for, feeding the applicant's own addiction), the assessment of objective gravity was one that was well open to Maiden DCJ.

36I would reject this ground of the application.

Ground 2: quantity of drugs

37Although it was put that the sentencing judge failed to consider the quantity of drugs involved, it is very difficult, from the Agreed Facts, to quantify the total amount of drugs supplied by the applicant. At times, the transactions were described in terms of monetary value; at others, in terms of the weight of the drugs. As mentioned in the outline of facts above, on the whole the quantity involved in any individual transaction was relatively small, sometimes quite small. However, as against that must be balanced the repetition of the dealing, and its sustained nature.

38In my opinion, the applicant has failed to make good this challenge. 

Ground 3: remorse

39Remorse is expressly recognised as a mitigating factor in s 21A(3)(i) of the Sentencing Procedure Act (but only if, relevantly, the offender has provided evidence of having accepted responsibility for his or her actions). There is no doubt that the applicant had provided such evidence, and gave oral evidence to that effect.

40It is true that the sentencing judge did not mention the applicant's expressed remorse. The submission was therefore made that:

""In considering the subjective case of the [applicant] no consideration was given to the remorse expressed by the [applicant] as contained in both his evidence ... and the report of psychologist Sam Borenstein ... failure to give effect to the remorse felt by the [applicant] led to an error in the ultimate sentence imposed.""

41In my opinion, remorse is to be seen as a mitigating factor because it is a concomitant of rehabilitation, meaning that future offending is unlikely or less likely. Rehabilitation was treated by his Honour in some depth. Even if his Honour had expressly referred to, and accepted, the evidence of remorse as an independent factor, it could not have had any real bearing on the outcome.

42I would reject this ground of appeal.

Ground 5: manifestly excessive?

43The submission was made that, even if none of the above grounds is upheld, the sentence (presumably the aggregate sentence) was manifestly excessive given the objective criminality of the offence taken in conjunction with the applicant's personal circumstances.

44I am unable to accept this. The drug dealing offences were plainly serious because of their sustained and repetitive nature. The applicant could derive no comfort from his previous record.

45It is true that the evidence of rehabilitation was very favourable, even though the sentencing judge was unpersuaded that it would have the degree of permanence that might be hoped. But general deterrence remained an important element in the sentencing decision. His Honour was plainly conscious of the market which the applicant was supplying with drugs, and the damage to end users and communities that is a result of drug dealing and drug use. I do not accept that the sentences, either individually or in aggregate, were manifestly excessive. 

46I propose the following orders:

(i)Leave to appeal each sentence granted;

(ii)Appeal dismissed.

47JOHNSON J: I agree with Simpson J.

1LEEMING JA: I agree with Hall J.

2ADAMS J: I agree with Hall J.

3HALL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal in respect of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 26 April 2013.

4In Amended Grounds of Appeal filed on 30 October 2013, the applicant gave notice that he relied upon the following grounds of appeal:

1. His Honour failed to properly consider whether or not in the circumstances of this case, a sentence of imprisonment other than full-time custody would be appropriate.

2. His Honour was in error in finding in relation to the s 178BB(1) offences that the objective criminality of the offences were more serious or aggravated by the fact that the appellant was an officer of the Supreme Court, and that he used administrative knowledge and experience to commit the offences.

3. The aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive, as the sentence indication with respect to the s 178BB(1) offences was excessive, thereby infecting the aggregate sentence with error.

4. The aggregate sentence was excessive as the indicated sentence in relation to the s 107 offence failed to reflect the significant objective and subjective distinctions between the appellant and the offender Behman, thereby infecting the aggregate sentence with error.

The Offences

5The applicant was charged with offences pursuant to the provisions of s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, and with a count of giving false evidence to the Police Integrity Commission, an offence under s 107(1) of the Police Integrity Commission Act 1996 (PIC Act).

6In relation to the offences of obtaining money by false or misleading statements, s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act was, at the time of the offences, in the following terms:

178BB(1) Whosoever, with intent to obtain for himself or herself or another person any money ... or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever, makes or publishes, or concurs in making or publishing, any statement (whether or not in writing) which he or she knows to be false or misleading in a material particular or which is false or misleading in a material particular and is made for reckless disregard as to whether it is true or is false or misleading in a material particular shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years.

7Section 107 of the PIC Act is in the following terms:

(1) A person who, at a hearing before the Commission, gives evidence that is, to the knowledge of the person, false or misleading in a material particular is guilty of an indictable offence.

Maximum penalty: 200 penalty units or imprisonment for 5 years, or both.

(2) Sections 331 and 332 of the Crimes Act 1900 apply to proceedings for an offence under this section in the same way as they apply to proceedings for an offence under section 330 of that Act.

The Aggregate Sentence

8The applicant was sentenced to an aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Act). 

9With respect to the four relevant offences of obtaining a financial advantage by false statement, the sentencing judge indicated a sentence of 9 months' imprisonment with respect to each offence.

10In respect of the offence of giving false evidence, the sentencing judge indicated a sentence of 18 months' imprisonment. I note that the indicative sentence in respect of the s 107 offence did not specify a non-parole period. Section 53A(2)(b) of the Sentencing Act specifies that a court that imposes an aggregate sentence of imprisonment under that section must indicate, inter alia, ""the sentence that would have been imposed for each offence ... had separate sentences been imposed instead of an aggregate sentence"".

11Accordingly, the applicant was sentenced by way of aggregate sentence pursuant to s 53A of the Sentencing Act upon the basis that he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 2 years to date from 26 April 2013 and to expire on 25 April 2015 with a non-parole period of 1 year to date from the commencement of the sentence and to expire on 25 April 2014.

12The sentencing judge made a finding of special circumstances.

Factual Matters

13Between October 2006 and November 2007, four traffic offences were committed in two motor vehicles registered to the applicant. Infringement notices were received by him. In relation to each notice he completed and sent a signed statutory declaration to the Infringement Processing Bureau nominating another person as being responsible for his motor vehicle when the traffic offences occurred. 

14On 23 June 2010, the applicant was originally served with Court Attendance Notices in relation to six charges of obtaining financial advantage by a false statement pursuant to s 178BB(1). He pleaded not guilty to all six charges. On 20 May 2011 he was committed for trial to the Sydney District Court.

15On 16 September 2011, the Crown filed an indictment containing the six committal charges and one additional ex-officio count of giving false evidence at a hearing before the Police Integrity Commission (""the Commission"") pursuant to s 107 of the PIC Act.

16The applicant entered not guilty pleas in relation to the six counts on the indictment under s 178BB(1). Prior to the trial the Crown severed the count relating to giving false evidence before the Commission. 

17On 4 October 2012 the applicant was arraigned before a jury. He pleaded not guilty to all counts. On 8 October 2012, there was a verdict by direction in relation to Count 2 on the indictment.

18On 11 October 2012, the jury acquitted the offender of Count 1 and found him guilty of the remaining four counts.

19The four offences charged under s 178BB(1), and in respect of which the applicant was convicted, occurred between 6 December 2006 and 20 November 2007.

20In relation to the offence of giving false evidence, the applicant had, on 5 September 2008, appeared before the Commission at a private hearing. The general scope and purpose of the hearing was ""... to investigate whether Peter Hanna, Tarek Behman, or any other person associated with them has been involved in criminal activity or police misconduct"". The applicant was asked a series of questions. The answers to those questions concerned the traffic offences that occurred on 25 October 2006, 14 November 2006, 27 June 2007 and 26 October 2007. The four statutory declarations made by the applicant in respect of the traffic offences falsely nominated a person, Kahlid Ak-Baras Mahmoud of Egypt as being the person responsible for each traffic offence.

21At the trial it was pointed out to the applicant during his evidence that inquiries had established that there was no person by that name who was present in Australia at the time of the traffic offences. It was put to him that his statutory declarations were false in that he had nominated a person as being in possession of the vehicle who was not in Australia at the time. The applicant denied that that was correct.

22The applicant accepted at the sentence hearing that his evidence before the Commission concerning the truthfulness of the four statutory declarations was false and at the time he knew it was false and that it material to the proceedings.

23The sentencing judge stated that he would not increase any sentence by reason of the fact that the applicant gave false evidence during his trial.

24As an issue of parity was raised at the sentence hearing, it is necessary to briefly refer to that aspect. The person, Tarek Behman, was sentenced in the District Court (Sorby DCJ) on 15 February 2013 in relation to eight counts of making false statements to obtain financial advantage contrary to s 178BB(1). The offences were committed by Behman in similar circumstances to the four offences committed by the applicant, in that the names of Egyptian national persons were nominated as drivers of the motor vehicles for the purposes of avoiding fines.

25Sorby DCJ considered that the appropriate sentences for the s 178BB offences to be a period of 16 months' imprisonment each.

26Behman pleaded guilty to one count of giving false evidence to the Commission contrary to s 107(1) of the PIC Act. He gave similar evidence to that of the applicant regarding the false nomination of persons as the driver of his motor vehicle. Sorby DCJ sentenced Behman to a period of 18 months' imprisonment in respect of the s 107(1) offence. His Honour sentenced Behman to an aggregate sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 2 years.

27Sorby DCJ, in sentencing Behman, had regard to the fact that Behman was a serving police officer at the time of the commission of each of the offences and the took advantage of his actual knowledge of the system so as to avoid paying fines with regard to the s 178BB(1) offences. In relation to the applicant, the sentencing judge expressly stated that this aspect did not apply to him in relation to the s 178BB(1) offences which he committed: Remarks on Sentence at p 11.

28A sentence hearing was fixed for 8 February 2013.

29The outstanding false evidence charge was listed for mention on 7 December 2012.

30On 7 December 2012, the application pleaded guilty to one count of giving false evidence before the Commission. The matter was stood over for sentence with the matters under s 178BB(1) and a new sentence date was fixed for 22 March 2013. 

31The sentencing judge noted that the applicant had not expressed any remorse in respect of the s 178BB(1) defences. However, in relation to the s 107(1) offence he had pleaded guilty and his plea, his Honour concluded, contained within it a degree of contrition. Further, the applicant gave evidence that he accepted responsibility that what he did was wrong. 

32The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 10% in respect of the s 178BB(1) offences in relation to assistance. In relation to the applicant's plea of guilty to the s 107(1) offence he discounted the sentence by 20% (10% for the utilitarian value of the plea and 10% for assistance).

33In relation to the objective seriousness of the offences on the indictment, the sentencing judge stated:

""I now turn to the analysis of the criminality involved in the offences. Insofar as the s 178BB(1) offences are concerned, the offences occurred between 6 December 2006 and 20 November 2007. I regard the offences as forming part of a continuous course of conduct of the offender. I find there was little planning involved in the offences. I regard the offences to be at the low end of objective seriousness for the offences. The offences, however, were committed by an intelligent man for his own benefit who described himself to the jury during the course of the trial as an officer of the Supreme Court and the Federal Court ..."" 

(This latter reference is to the applicant's evidence at trial that as a liquidator he was an officer of the Supreme Court of NSW and the Federal Court).

The Section 107 Offence

34The applicant's case on the s 107 offence was put upon the basis that he gave false evidence before the Commission on 5 September 2008 because he feared for his own safety and the safety of his children from Tarek Behman, as noted above, a serving police officer who was being investigated by the Commission. The sentencing judge did not accept, for the purposes of the sentencing exercise, that the applicant acted out of fear as he claimed.

35In relation to the objective seriousness of the s 107(1) offence, the sentencing judge observed:

""... Prior to giving evidence, Commissioner Pritchard informed the offender he could be prosecuted should he give false or misleading evidence at the hearing. The offender, despite the warning, gave false evidence at the hearing. I reject the offender's explanation that he gave evidence as a consequence of his fear of Tarek Behman. I reject the offender's evidence as I do not regard him as a witness of truth."" Remarks on Sentence at p 9

36The sentencing judge concluded:

""... In relation to the s 107(1) offence I find that there was a greater obligation on the offender than on Behman not to give false evidence, having regard to the offender being an officer of the Supreme Court and the Federal Court.

In the case of the offender I found [that he] at the time of the commission of the offences was suffering from psychological conditions which reduced his moral culpability, whereas his Honour Judge Sorby did not make a similar finding regarding Behman's psychological state."" Remarks on Sentence at p 11

37I will return to the sentencing judge's above finding as to ""a greater obligation"", below.

38The sentencing judge made the finding of special circumstances to which I have earlier referred in relation to the applicant by reason of the fact that this was the first time he was to undertake a full-time custodial sentence and that he required ongoing rehabilitation in the community.

39The s 107 offence was clearly an objectively serious one. This is especially so given the sentencing judge's rejection of the applicant's account of having given false evidence as a consequence of fear held by him of Behman. 

40The offence involved an intentional act of misleading the Commission by giving false and misleading evidence at the hearing being conducted by it. As noted above, he had previously been warned by the Commission of the consequences of doing so having sought and obtained a declaration under s 41 of the PIC Act. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the offending conduct it was not only likely but, in my view inevitable, that the sentencing judge had to impose a full-time custodial sentence of imprisonment. Such a sentence was the only available sentencing outcome in respect of the applicant's perjury offence being at the higher end of the range of objective seriousness for such an offence, and one that was necessary to give effect to the principle of general deterrence.

Grounds of Appeal

Ground 1 - His Honour failed to properly consider whether or not in the circumstances of this case, a sentence of imprisonment other than full-time custody would be appropriate

41The transcripts record that there was, during the sentencing hearing, discussion of a possible sentencing option in the form of an Intensive Community Order (""ICO"") in the event that an aggregate sentence of imprisonment no greater than two years was imposed.

42It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that this was a case in which there were alternative sentencing options. Reference was made to the provisions of s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act which specifies that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate.

43Whilst Mr Stewart of counsel who appeared on behalf of the applicant in this Court, submitted that there were possible alternatives, namely, a bond or a financial penalty, those were not raised as sentencing options at the sentencing hearing. Rather, as indicated above, the submission on behalf of the applicant to the sentencing judge was focused upon the possibility of an ICO rather than a full-time custodial sentence.

44There is, in my opinion, no basis for the submission that the sentencing judge proceeded contrary to the requirements of s 5(1) of the Sentencing Act. The real question was whether or not, before imposing a full-time custodial sentence, his Honour was required to consider alternative sentencing options and, in particular, whether an ICO was appropriate in the circumstances of the case.

45As the Crown correctly submitted, in choosing an alternative to full-time custody, a sentencing court cannot lose sight of the fact that the more lenient the alternative, the less likely it is to fulfil all the purposes of punishment.

46As the Crown also submitted, general deterrence was significant to the sentencing exercise involved in the present case, especially so in relation to the s 107 offence for which there are well-settled principles: R v Irwan [1999] NSWCCA 361 at [50]; R v Aristomenou (NSWCCA, 30 June 1994, unreported); R v Bulliman (NSWCCA, 25 February 1993, unreported).

47Although the sentencing judge did not make any reference to, or provide reasons for not imposing an ICO I do not consider that fact of itself establishes error. 

48Whether or not there was an alternative sentence for each or all of the s 178BB(1) offences (a matter considered below), would not have altered the fact that in sentencing the applicant at the one time for all offences (including in particular the s 107(1) offence) an ICO was never an option. The criminality involved in the s 107 offence effectively ensured that outcome. 

Sentencing in Respect of the Section 178BB(1) Offences

49In circumstances in which it was clear that a sentence of imprisonment was the only sentencing option open in relation to the s 107 offence, the sentencing judge was required to consider whether a sentence or sentences of imprisonment was/were appropriate in respect of the s 178BB(1) offences or whether there was a more appropriate alternative sentencing option. 

50His Honour was required to consider all the relevant objective and subjective factors in relation to the s 107 and s 178BB(1) offences. In relation to his mental/psychological condition, his Honour accepted the medical evidence of Dr Borenstein to the effect that the applicant was, at the time of the commission of the offence, suffering from a chronic adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. This, his Honour stated, reduced, to some degree, the general deterrent effect of the sentence.

51There were subjective factors that operated in the applicant's favour. These included the fact that the applicant had no prior criminal history, he was found to have had good prospects of rehabilitation and the fact, as the sentencing judge observed, that he had taken steps towards rehabilitation within the community with an accredited expert.

52Counsel who appeared for the applicant at the sentencing hearing submitted in respect of the overall sentences, not that a custodial sentence was not appropriate, but rather that the sentencing judge might consider it appropriate that the applicant be assessed for an ICO as the appropriate means of serving any sentence imposed.

53As discussed above, given that the applicant was being sentenced for the s 107 offence as well as the other offences, there was no requirement for the sentencing judge to have expressly addressed the issue of an ICO or other sentencing alternatives to a full-time custodial sentence.

54I do not consider there is any substance to Ground 1. That ground accordingly should be dismissed.

Ground 2 - His Honour was in error in finding in relation to the s 178BB(1) offences that the objective criminality of the offences were more serious or aggravated by the fact that the appellant was an officer of the Supreme Court, and that he used administrative knowledge and experience to commit the offences

Ground 3 - The aggregate sentence was manifestly excessive, as the sentence indication with respect to the s 178BB(1) offences was excessive, thereby infecting the aggregate sentence with error

55I consider that Grounds 2 and 3 should be considered together.

56A number of matters in particular arise in respect of the s 178BB(1) offences.

57I observe at this point, that the nature of the offences the subject of R v Einfeld [2009] NSWSC 119; and Einfeld v R [2010] NSWCCA 87 were different from the offences here in question. In Einfeld, the prosecution related to two offences; the first a charge of perjury under s 327 of the Crimes Act, and the second a charge of perverting the course of justice under s 319 of the Crimes Act. An offence under s 178BB(1) is a considerably less serious offence for which the prescribed maximum penalty is a period of 5 years imprisonment.

58Insofar as the sentencing judge determined an indicative sentence for ""each"" offence under s 178BB(1) of a period of 9 months imprisonment, I do not consider that the objective seriousness of the first of those offences could justify or require a full-time custodial sentence to be imposed in respect of it in the particular circumstances of this case.

59The first of the s 178BB(1) offences committed in December 2006 as with the other three offences under that section involved the making of a false statement to obtain a financial benefit. Having regard however to the favourable subjective findings, I do not consider that the first of the s 178BB(1) offences alone called for a custodial sentence. It was a first offence and involved little by way of financial benefit. The offence could not alone, in my opinion, attract a sentence by way of a term of imprisonment of 9 months in accordance with the sentence indicated by the sentencing judge.

60The subsequent commission of the second, third and fourth s 178BB(1) offences, however, did, as his Honour observed, reflect an attitude of disregard for the law by the applicant. That introduced an objectively higher level of culpability than the first s 178BB(1) offence alone.

61It is to be noted that his Honour went on to state in his remarks on sentence that he found that there was little planning involved in the offences and he regarded them as offences ""... at the low end of objective seriousness for the offences ..."": Remarks on Sentence p 9.

62Criticism was directed to two particular comments made by the sentencing judge in respect of these latter offences. Firstly, his Honour observed that they were committed by ""... an intelligent man for his own benefit who described himself to the jury during the course of the trial as an officer of the Supreme Court and the Federal Court ..."": Remarks on Sentence at p 9.

63Secondly, his Honour went on to state: ""The offender took advantage of his knowledge of the administrative system generally in order to commit the offences"".

64Although I consider that there is some validity in the submissions that his Honour was wrong to take into account these latter two matters, I do not, at the end of the day, however consider that they had any material influence or effect as to the length of the indicative sentences for the s 178BB(1) offences in circumstances in which his Honour categorised all four offences as being at the low end of objective seriousness. His Honour proceeded upon that basis.

65I have concluded that the sentencing judge's determination of indicative sentences of 9 months each for the four offences charged under s 178BB(1) displays error, in that the objective seriousness of the first of the four offences alone could not justify a term of imprisonment of that duration. I consider that in the particular circumstances of this case, including the relevant subjective factors and findings made by the sentencing judge, the indicative sentences of 9 months' imprisonment for the first and each of the remaining three s 178BB(1) offences to be manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I consider that the indicative sentences for the four s 178BB(1) offences were manifestly excessive. Ground 3 should be upheld.

Ground 4 - The aggregate sentence was excessive as the indicated sentence in relation to the s 107 offence failed to reflect the significant objective and subjective distinctions between the applicant and the offender Behman, thereby infecting the aggregate sentence with error

66I have referred above to the objective seriousness of the s 107 offence. Conduct by a person involving the giving of evidence to an investigatory body such as the PIC which, to the knowledge of that person is false or misleading in a material particular, is one that attracts a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment.

67Ground 4 asserts that there were significant objective and subjective distinctions between the applicant and Behman leading to error.

68I accept that the sentencing judge was in error in finding that there was a greater obligation on the applicant than on Behman not to give false sworn evidence having regard to the applicant being an officer of the Supreme and Federal Courts.

69The applicant, of course, was not a judicial officer of either Court. He put himself forward, it is to be noted, as being an officer of the above Courts on the basis that, when acting as a liquidator he acted as an officer of either Court.

70That could not, in my opinion, form the basis for a finding of a ""greater obligation"" on the applicant than Behman. Behman was at the time a serving police officer in a position of trust. The sentencing judge's observation of the respective obligations of the applicant and Behman was erroneous for their respective obligations, in my assessment, were not susceptible to any meaningful distinction or ranking. They were both in serious breach of s 107.

71Although error as discussed has been established in relation to Ground 3 and in terms of the finding of a greater obligation in the applicant, in my assessment, no lesser sentence than that imposed in respect of the s 107 offence was warranted.

72Ground 4, in my opinion, should be dismissed.

73I have concluded:

(1) An indicative sentence of 9 months' imprisonment for each of the s 178BB(1) offences was manifestly excessive.

(2) Although error has been established in respect of the indicative sentences for the s 178BB(1) offences and the sentencing judge's finding as discussed above, no lesser sentence for the s 107 offence is warranted than that imposed, namely, a sentence of imprisonment of 18 months.

Re-Sentencing

74I propose on re-sentence, firstly, that a bond pursuant to s 9(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 should be imposed upon the applicant for a period of 18 months. Secondly, that pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 an aggregate sentence of 3 months imprisonment be imposed with respect to the second, third and fourth offences under s 178BB(1). Thirdly, that the applicant be re-sentenced to a term of imprisonment in respect of the s 107 offence of 18 months with a non-parole period of 8 months based upon a finding of special circumstances.

75The sentence of imprisonment in respect of the offence under s 107 Police Integrity Commission Act 1999 should be accumulated upon the sentences of imprisonment to be imposed for the s 178BB(1) offences by a period of one month to give effect to the principle of totality.

76I consider that a finding of special circumstances should, for the reasons stated by the sentencing judge, be made and I accordingly make a finding to that effect. On the sentences that I propose below, that will result in an alteration of the statutory ratio of non-parole to parole periods in respect of the s 107 offence to 44.4%.

77In respect of the offences under s 178BB(1) Crimes Act 1900, and pursuant to s 53A(2)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I list the individual offences (to be dealt with in the aggregate sentence) with the following indicative sentences.

(i) In relation to the offence committed by the offender on or about 29 January 2007, a term of imprisonment for a period of 3 months.

(ii) In relation to the offence committed by the offender on or about 20 July 2007, a term of imprisonment for a period of 3 months.

(iii) In relation to the offence committed by the offender on or about 20 November 2007, a term of imprisonment for a period of 3 months.

Orders

(1) Leave to appeal granted.

(2) Appeal upheld.

(3) The sentence imposed by the District Court on 26 April 2013 be quashed.

(4) The offender be re-sentenced as follows:

(i) In relation to the offence committed by the offender pursuant to s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 on or about 6 December 2006, pursuant to s 9(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, order that the offender enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of 18 months to commence on 26 April 2013 and to expire on 25 October 2014.

(ii) In respect of the three offences committed by the offender pursuant to s 178BB(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 on or about 29 January 2007, 20 July 2007 and 20 November 2007, an aggregate sentence of imprisonment pursuant to s 53A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of 3 months to commence on 26 April 2013 and to expire on 25 July 2013.

(iii) In respect of the offence under s 107 Police Integrity Commission Act 1996, a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 months to commence on 26 May 2013 and to expire on 25 January 2014 with a balance of term of 10 months to expire on 25 November 2014.

The earliest date upon which the offender will be eligible for parole will be on 25 January 2014.

2705655,Hugo JACOBS v R [2013] NSWCCA 332,"Judgment


	
	HIDDEN J: At trial in the District Court the appellant, Hugo Jacobs, was found guilty of supplying a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. He appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence.
	
	
	Put shortly, it was the Crown case that the appellant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with one Bassam Darwiche to supply 413.1 grams of methylamphetamine to two men from Melbourne, Sammy Quariaqus and Martin Mansour, at a motel at Casula on 19 June 2008. The evidence against the appellant was circumstantial. Police had been intercepting calls on a phone being used by Mr Darwiche, who was under investigation. It was alleged that the appellant was a party to some of those calls, and that during them the two men used code words referring to drugs.
	
	
	Mr Darwiche lived in Wellington Road, Sefton. The home was subject to video surveillance by police. In the afternoon of 19 June 2008 a green Holden Maloo utility was seen to stop near that home, and the driver alighted from it. It was the Crown case that this was the appellant. Later that afternoon, under police observation, that man and Mr Darwiche travelled in the Maloo to the motel at Casula. They were seen to enter the motel and leave it shortly afterwards. It was alleged that the drug was supplied in a room at the motel registered in the name of Mr Quariaqus.
	
	
	Mr Quariaqus and Mr Mansour were kept under police surveillance as they subsequently left the motel in a yellow Ford. Later that evening, police stopped that vehicle in the Goulburn area. 413.1 grams of methylamphetamine was found wrapped inside bags in the vehicle. A search of the motel room revealed a broken drug pipe which, on the Crown case, had been used to sample the drug prior to the supply.
	
	
	At the trial it was in issue whether the driver of the Maloo was the appellant, and whether it was he whose voice could be heard in the relevant telephone conversations with Mr Darwiche. There was circumstantial evidence connecting him with the vehicle. Importantly, however, the Crown relied upon the visual and aural identification of the appellant by his estranged wife, Illianna Ibrahim, who had viewed the video surveillance footage and listened to recordings of the relevant phone conversations. Ms Ibrahim's evidence is the primary focus of the appeal.
	
	
	Hugo Jacobs is a name which the appellant has assumed. He was previously known as Hashem Ibrahim, and it was that surname by which his wife was known after their marriage. Ms Ibrahim did not know him at the time of the offence. They met in February 2009 and married in May of that year. It is apparent from answers she gave in cross-examination that the relationship was a turbulent one, and they separated early in October 2010. It was towards the end of the following month, shortly before the trial, that she provided police with her visual and aural identification of him.
	
	
	As to the visual identification, her evidence was that she recognised the driver of the green Maloo in the surveillance footage as the appellant. She added that she recognised his gait, the pants he was wearing, his sunglasses and the clutch bag he was carrying. She also said that she recognised the vehicle as his. The reliability of this evidence was tested at some length in cross-examination.
	
	
	More importantly, however, it was put to her that she was giving evidence ""wishing to take revenge"" on the appellant arising from their separation. That question was put specifically in relation to her aural identification but, presumably, it was not intended to be confined to that aspect of her evidence. Later in cross-examination, again in relation to the aural identification, it was put to her that she had identified passages in the intercepted conversations as being in the appellant's voice irrespective of what she was actually hearing. These allegations, of course, she denied.
	
	
	No doubt, the cross-examination on this aspect focused upon her aural identification because her evidence about that was either truthful or it was not, whereas the video footage was such that her visual identification was open to error. However, in his final address to the jury, trial counsel for the appellant (who did not appear in this court) made it plain enough that he challenged the honesty of her evidence of identification generally, asserting that it was the product of bias and prejudice.
	
	
	The appellant did not give evidence. He relied upon a critical analysis of the Crown case by his counsel.
	
	
	There are 10 grounds of appeal. The first two challenge the admissibility of Ms Ibrahim's visual and aural identification. Grounds 3 - 7 relate to the manner in which Ms Ibrahim gave her evidence at the trial. Grounds 8 and 9 are concerned with the opinion evidence of one of the investigating detectives about the meaning of certain expressions used in the intercepted phone conversations. Ground 10 asserts that fresh evidence obtained since the trial bearing on the credibility of Ms Ibrahim demonstrates that there has been a miscarriage of justice. It is convenient to deal with that last ground first.
	


Fresh evidence


	
	The trial took place in December 2010, and the appellant was sentenced in May 2011. In an affidavit filed in this court the appellant deposed that, in late December 2011 or early January 2012, he received at the prison where he was being held a number of items sent to him though the post by Ms Ibrahim. There was a Christmas card and some photos of a baby, on which there were greetings and comments in her handwriting. It appears that she claims to have borne a child to the appellant, which he disputes. Indeed, there is an issue whether she had borne a child at all. Whether the baby in the photos was their progeny has been under investigation by the police. Where the truth of that matter may lie is not material for present purposes.
	
	
	With these items, the appellant said, there was a typewritten letter, undated and unsigned, commencing ""My darling Hashem."" The letter expressed great resentment against the appellant, although asserting a continuing love for him. Significantly for present purposes, it included the following:
	


""Please do not hold any grudges you betrayed me so I had not (sic) choice by (sic) to protect our son and I had to do whatever I could to get you locked up even though I lied about everything and your voice, but we set you up ha ha.""


	
	According to the appellant, he received further items through the post in February 2012. These comprised of a photo of him and Ms Ibrahim with a note in her handwriting on the back to the effect that it was taken in 2010 on the occasion of their wedding anniversary, and another typewritten letter, again unsigned and undated. This letter also began, ""My Darling Hashem"", and continued, ""Happy Valentine's Day from your wife ... ."" After a further expression of resentment against him, the following appears:
	


""I have heard through the grapevine that you are appealing your conviction iv spoken to someone and if you get a retrial I have to come back and give evidence I will make sure I will say whatever I need to so I can fuck you and keep you in prison. I don't care anymore if I have to lie about everything, I will do whatever and say whatever to keep you in prison. ... I will do everything in my power to make sure you are miserable and don't have your freedom you little boy ... .""


	
	The appellant had his brother deliver these items to his solicitor, who referred them to the police. No fingerprints of Ms Ibrahim or the appellant were detected on either of the typewritten letters. Detective Sergeant Dickman showed them to Ms Ibrahim in February of this year. In an affidavit filed in this court she maintained that the evidence she had given at the trial was true, asserting that she was ""not the author"" of the two typewritten letters and that she did not ""post or send them"" to the appellant. Indeed, she wrote handwritten comments on the questioned documents. On the first of them she asserted that she found it to be ""fiction nothing but lies and unworthy truths (sic) against me."" On the second she described her husband as ""a liar"", again asserting that she had told the truth in court.
	
	
	However, there was an unexpected development at the hearing of the appeal when Ms Ibrahim gave oral evidence. She confirmed that she had sent the card and the photos on the two occasions in question, but added that she may have also sent the typewritten letters. She acknowledged that she had prepared both of them. She explained that she had recently obtained a new computer, and that she had located a USB stick for her old computer upon which the documents appeared. She said that they were two of four letters she had prepared. She said that she had contacted Detective Dickman a few days before the hearing to point out her error.
	
	
	Nevertheless, she maintained that her evidence at the trial was true. She claimed that another letter of the four she had prepared would provide an explanation for the two letters in evidence. However, she said that she no longer had those other two letters because she had wiped them from the USB when she obtained the new computer. The contents of that letter were not pursued by either counsel in the appeal: nor was she pressed about why she had typed the two letters in question, amounting to an admission that she had perjured herself and was prepared to do so again, if she had been telling the truth at the trial. No explanation of her conduct was forthcoming in her oral evidence.
	
	
	Counsel for the appellant in this court, Mr Turnbull SC, raised with her the police investigation of her claim that she had borne a child to the appellant, and she agreed that that investigation had been unable to establish the existence of such a child. He then suggested that that matter, together with ""the realisation that these letters were going to be sheeted home to you"", had led to her decision ""to come clean about the lies"" she had told in her affidavit. This she rejected. 
	
	
	Where the truth lies in all this is anyone's guess. Clearly, however, this is material which has arisen since the trial and it is capable of bearing significantly upon Ms Ibrahim's credibility. As will be seen when I turn to other grounds of the appeal, her credibility had already been called into question by her behaviour during her evidence at the trial. This fresh material flies in the face of her denials at the trial that her evidence was motivated by vengeance and that she was prepared falsely to identify one of the voices in the intercepted phone conversations as the appellant's.
	
	
	I should record that in April 2011 the appellant was tried before Latham J for murder, a charge unrelated to the present matter. He was acquitted. Ms Ibrahim also gave evidence in that trial. However, it is clear that the two typewritten letters relate to the present matter. So much is apparent from the reference in the first letter to her having lied ""about everything and your voice"", and from her reference in the second letter to the fact that the appellant had appealed against his conviction and to the possibility of a re-trial.
	
	
	It is not in doubt that a ground of appeal based on fresh evidence may rely upon evidence bearing upon the credibility of a witness: Grey v The Queen [2001] HCA 65, 75 ALJR 1708, in the plurality judgment at [15] ff (1712). The principles governing a fresh evidence ground are also settled by long standing authority. They were summarised by Kirby J in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356, 149 A Crim R 417. At [63] (427-8), his Honour dealt with the distinction between ""fresh"" and ""new"" evidence. As I have said, the evidence in the present case is plainly fresh as it was not available at the time of the trial. His Honour continued:
	


""..., the Court is ultimately concerned with whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The rationale for setting aside a conviction on the basis of new evidence or fresh evidence is that the absence of that evidence from the trial was, in effect, a miscarriage of justice. That evidence must be examined in the context of the evidence given at the trial ... .""


	
	Kirby J then dealt with the question whether a successful fresh evidence ground might give rise to a verdict of acquittal or an order for a new trial. In the present case it is a new trial which is sought. To obtain that order the crucial question, as his Honour posed it, is:
	


""... would that evidence, in the context of the evidence given at the trial, have been likely to have caused the jury to have entertained a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused ... or, if there is a practical difference, is there a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the accused ... ?""

To answer that question in the present case, it is necessary to put aside the evidence of Ms Ibrahim and evaluate the other evidence at the trial.


	
	It was certainly open to the jury to conclude that a drug transaction had taken place in the motel room in the afternoon in question. It was also open to them to conclude that Mr Darwiche and the man in the green Maloo had been involved in the supply of the drug. So much is apparent from the brief summary of the surveillance evidence set out above. It should also be noted that the man who alighted from the green Maloo was carrying a small, dark bag over his shoulder and was seen to enter Mr Darwiche's home. He still had that bag when the two men emerged from the home and set off towards the motel.
	
	
	Moreover, this conclusion finds support in the evidence of the use of mobile phones. A mobile number 0415.109106 was used to contact Mr Darwiche in the evening of 18 June 2008 and throughout the following day. Those calls were intercepted and the terms of them are consistent with discussion of a drug deal. As I have said, it was the Crown case that those conversations were in a code, and evidence about that matter was given by one of the investigating police officers, Detective Sergeant Evans. (This is the evidence the subject of grounds 8 and 9 of the appeal.) The same mobile phone number was used on both days to contact a mobile number 0449.805151, which was found in the yellow Ford occupied by the two men from Melbourne when the police stopped and searched it in the Goulburn area.
	
	
	The timing of these calls in the afternoon of 19 June is consistent with the observed movements of the man in the green Maloo and Mr Darwiche from the time the Maloo arrived at Wellington Road, Sefton to the time they departed from the motel at Casula, and is also consistent with contact with the two men from Mellbourne during that same period. The inference was available that it was the man in the green Maloo who used the mobile phone ending -106, and that it was he who was the contact with the Melbourne purchasers. The crucial question is whether, absent the evidence of Ms Ibrahim, it could be established that that man was the appellant. It is necessary to examine the circumstantial evidence which might support that conclusion.
	
	
	I have viewed the video surveillance footage showing the arrival of the Maloo outside Mr Darwiche's home and the driver alighting from it and walking to the property. It may be that someone familiar with that man could recognise him from the footage. However, the features of the man are indistinct. He is wearing sunglasses and has a shoulder bag, but there is nothing distinctive about those items or about his clothing. Through the evidence of Ms Ibrahim, there were admitted five photos taken between May and September 2009, over a year after the offence. Three of the photos depict the appellant, and in three of them can be seen a green Maloo of the same appearance as that in the footage. No meaningful comparison could be made between the appearance of the appellant in those photos and that of the man in the footage.
	
	
	There was evidence connecting the appellant with the Maloo seen in the footage in the months before and after the offence. The registration number of the vehicle was GRN-32F. On 13 March 2008 a traffic infringement notice in respect of the vehicle was issued to the appellant, apparently in relation to a traffic light offence. It was issued to the driver of the vehicle on the occasion in question under the name Hugo Jacobs, and enquiries of the police database by Detective Evans revealed that that person had previously been recorded as Hashem Ibrahim.
	
	
	On 30 September 2008 the vehicle was stopped and the driver was required to undergo a breath test. He produced a licence in the name of Hugo Jacobs, and the police officer observed that the photograph on the licence resembled the driver. The officer obtained further particulars from him because it appeared that the licence had been suspended due to a fine default. The address on the licence was recorded as 505N/23 Shelley Street, Sydney. The driver said that he had lived there for ""years"", although he had moved out for a short time and returned around July 2008.
	
	
	The mobile phone ending -106 to which I have referred was registered on 6 April 2007 to one Brian Copper of B05/23 Shelley Street, Sydney. Enquiries by Detective Evans of the RTA database, the police database and the Australian Electoral Roll did not reveal any person of that name linked to that address. He thought that the unit number could have been B05 or 805.
	
	
	23 Shelley Street is one of a number of blocks of units in that street, which is in the King Street Wharf area. A security guard, Daniel Soulini, whose duties engaged him in the buildings from 23 to 49 Shelley Street, gave evidence. He knew the appellant as a resident in the area. He said that in around 2006 the appellant moved into unit 505/23 Shelley Street, and that around mid-2008 he moved to unit 302/45 Shelley Street. It might be noted that neither of those addresses is the same as that shown on the appellant's driver's licence. There was a large carpark for residents of the buildings 23-35 Shelley Street. The appellant had a bay in that carpark, but Mr Soulini did not know what number was assigned to it. He viewed still photographs taken from security footage of the carpark in the afternoon of 5 October 2008, and identified the appellant appearing in a number of them.
	
	
	This evidence about the Shelley Street units was led to establish the appellant's association with them, and to found the Crown case that the mobile -106 was in fact the appellant's, having been registered in April 2007 under a false name. However, the unit number under which the phone was registered is different from the number on the driver's licence and from either of the numbers referred to in Mr Soulini's evidence. It will be recalled that the unit number shown on the driver's licence was 505N, and on the phone registration was B05 (or, possibly, 805). It does not appear that the question whether those notations were in error, and should have referred to 505, was explored in the evidence. Moreover, it emerged from the evidence of Mr Soulini that 23 Shelley Street is a block of 14 floors, containing roughly 220 units. He agreed that there was accommodation in the block for somewhere between 500 and 700 people.
	
	
	Mr Soulini also said that he was familiar with the appellant's car, which he described as a green Commodore ute. As I understand it, a Maloo is similar in appearance to a Commodore. A vehicle of that kind can be seen in some of the security photos, but not enough of it can be seen to identify it as the Maloo in question. This aspect of his evidence does not appear to have loomed large in the Crown case at trial, and was referred to only in passing by the Crown prosecutor in this court.
	
	
	In none of the intercepted phone conversations of 18 and 19 June 2008 did either of the participants refer to the other by name. However, there was also in evidence a later intercepted call in which Mr Darwiche's phone was used, on 3 July 2008. It seems that the parties to that conversation were women, who were not identified. In that call one or other of the participants refers on several occasions to ""Hash"". A participant is heard to ask a question, apparently addressed to someone in the vicinity, ""Have you got Hashs' number, Bass?"" It was the Crown case that ""Hash"" was a contraction of the appellant's name, Hashem, and ""Bass"" was a contraction of Mr Darwiche's given name, Bassam.
	
	
	Apparently, there was no evidence that the appellant was at any stage the registered owner of the Maloo bearing the registration GRN-32F. Nevertheless, there was clear evidence of his association with that vehicle and, in particular, of his use of it over a period encompassing the date of the offence. There is also evidence that he was a resident of a unit in 23 Shelley Street at the time the mobile phone - 106 was registered in the name of Brian Copper. To this must be added the intercepted phone call of 3 July 2008 which suggests association between Mr Darwiche and someone called ""Hash.""
	
	
	This evidence in combination certainly raises a strong suspicion that the appellant was involved in the offence in the manner contended for by the Crown, and was capable of lending support to the evidence of Ms Ibrahim. Nevertheless, her evidence remained central to the Crown case identifying the appellant as a participant in the criminal enterprise. While her credibility was impugned at trial, it is subject to much greater challenge now in the light of the fresh evidence, which could well justify the rejection of the whole of her testimony. In my view, if such a challenge to her credibility had been available at the trial, there is a significant possibility that the jury, acting reasonably, would have acquitted the appellant.
	
	
	This ground is made out, and it is sufficient to justify orders that the conviction be set aside and a new trial be had. However, it is appropriate to deal with the other grounds of appeal, albeit briefly.
	


Ms Ibrahim's conduct


	
	Ms Ibrahim's demeanour as a witness in the trial was remarkable. In written submissions the Crown prosecutor in this court, with admirable restraint, described it as ""exuberant."" It might better be described as unruly. Grounds 3 to 7 complain that the trial was unfair because of her behaviour which, it is said, should have been more firmly controlled by the trial judge and, in the event, should have led to the jury being discharged or, at least, have been the subject of a more robust direction by her Honour than it was.
	
	
	Submissions on these grounds were developed at some length, both in writing and orally, but it is not necessary to examine them in any detail. There is no doubt that, under cross-examination, Ms Ibrahim gave her evidence in an adversarial manner. She frequently gave unresponsive answers to questions which were prejudicial to the appellant or designed to bolster her own credibility. At times she answered questions in an aggressive manner directed personally to defence counsel, addressing him rudely and sometimes contemptuously. On other occasions she criticised counsel for being repetitive in the line of questioning when, in truth, he had to pursue it at length because he could not get a straight answer from her.
	
	
	She presented the trial judge with a difficult task in controlling her while remaining evenhanded. That said, there is some force in Mr Turnbull's complaint that her Honour might have controlled her more firmly and that, although she gave the jury a direction about Ms Ibrahim's evidence in the summing up, it might have been expressed in stronger terms. However, I do not find it necessary to express any concluded view about that.
	
	
	This aspect of the trial is undoubtedly troubling but, on balance, I am not persuaded that it gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. In the event, defence counsel took the opportunity to turn Ms Ibrahim's behaviour to his advantage in his final address to the jury. He was able to submit, as he did,:
	


""Mrs Ibrahim quite clearly can in no way, no stretch of the imagination, be described as an objective, calm, rational, neutral witness. ... She very clearly is a woman on a mission and you would not take what she says as being objective. ... She's biased and she's prejudiced..., you don't have to go any further at all than just recalling what she was like when she was giving her evidence here in the witness box in front of you.""


	
	Counsel went on to compare her demeanour when giving evidence in chief to when she was under cross-examination, a process which he described as ""like drawing teeth... ."" He repeated that she was ""on a mission regarding her estranged husband,"" and posed as a question to the jury whether what she was doing was ""really genuinely trying to help you with your job.""
	
	
	I would not uphold these grounds of appeal although, as there must be a new trial, it is not strictly necessary to decide them. Suffice it to say that if Ms Ibrahim were to be called at a retrial, a very tight rein would need to be kept on her.
	


The identification evidence


	
	Grounds 1 and 2 assert that Ms Ibrahim's identification evidence, visual and aural, should not have been admitted. The focus of these grounds was the trial judge's rejection of a submission based upon s 114(2) of the Evidence Act 1995. That subsection provides:
	


""(2) Visual identification evidence adduced by the prosecutor is not admissible unless:

(a) an identification parade that included the defendant was held before the identification was made, or

(b) it would not have been reasonable to have held such a parade, or

(c) the defendant refused to take part in such a parade,

and the identification was made without the person who made it having been intentionally influenced to identify the defendant.""


	
	The submission was founded upon the concluding words of the subsection. It was put that her Honour would not be satisfied that Ms Ibrahim's identification was made without her having been intentionally influenced to make it. The issue was the subject of evidence on the voir dire from Ms Ibrahim and the police officers who had interviewed her, Detectives McKinnon and Brahmann. The effect of their evidence was that Ms Ibrahim knew that she was being interviewed about a drug matter which related to the appellant. The evidence of Ms Ibrahim and Detective McKinnon was that she was asked to view some video footage to see if she could identify anyone in it, and to listen to some recorded conversations to see if she could identify any of the voices heard, without it being suggested that the appellant might be the person identified. The evidence of Detective Brahmann tended to the contrary. Her recollection was that the appellant was referred to in that context, but she acknowledged that her recollection was not clear and she had made no note of the exact words used.
	
	
	Her Honour gave reasons for admitting the evidence over this objection in a separate judgement. She preferred the evidence of Ms Ibrahim and Detective McKinnon to that of Detective Brahmann. After referring to Ms Ibraham's evidence, she concluded:
	


""So, overall, having regard to her evidence and to Detective McKinnon's evidence, and Detective Brahmann's evidence being less clear, I am not persuaded that Ms Ibrahim's identification of Mr Jacobs visually was intentionally influenced by the police officers who visited her to take a statement.""

On appeal Mr Turnbull acknowledged, as her Honour had held, that s 114(2) applied to the visual identification evidence only. Nevertheless, he argued that the issue raised also affected the aural identification evidence and might have led to its exclusion pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act.


	
	The complaint on appeal was that in the passage quoted her Honour reversed the onus of proof. It was not for the appellant to persuade her that Ms Ibrahim's identification was intentionally influenced by the police officers; it was for the Crown to satisfy her that it was not. From the terms of the subsection that is clearly so, and the Crown prosecutor in this court did not suggest the contrary.
	
	
	However, I think that there is force in the Crown prosecutor's submission that that passage of her Honour's reasons was infelicitously expressed and does not portray a misapprehension about where the burden of proof lay. In argument on this issue defence counsel had emphasised the burden of proof borne by the Crown on several occasions. The Crown prosecutor at the trial did not suggest the contrary.
	
	
	Again, on balance, I do not find this ground made out. It was open to her Honour to assess the evidence as she did and that assessment could have led to a decision that the Crown discharged its onus on this issue. I might add that, as a practical matter, it may well be that Ms Ibrahim assumed that she was being asked whether she could identify her husband in the footage and the recordings. As I have said, she was told that police were enquiring about a drug matter in which he may have been involved. Of course, that of itself could not have amounted to intentional influence within the meaning of the subsection.
	


Expert evidence


	
	Grounds 8 and 9 relate to the expert evidence given by Detective Evans. Objection had been taken to this evidence on a number of bases. As refined in oral argument, these grounds complained that he was permitted to express an opinion about a matter which was not an expert opinion.
	
	
	Mr Turnbull accepted that the detective, from his experience in drug investigations, was qualified to express opinions about code words said to have been used in the intercepted phone conversations and about the practice of drug distribution, in particular, quantities in which drugs are normally sold and the monetary value of drugs. The complaint relates to one of the intercepted phone conversations, to which the appellant was not a party. It was a conversation between Mr Darwiche and one Ghassan Hamze. This material did not directly implicate the appellant, but it was relevant to the Crown case about the nature of the drug transaction which took place in the afternoon of 19 June.
	
	
	As I understand it, it was the Crown case that the drug sold to the men from Melbourne had been obtained from Mr Hamze. The relevant call was at 3:09pm on 19 June, after the man alleged to be the appellant had arrived at Mr Darwiche's home but before the two men proceeded to the motel at Casula. The terms of the call convey a complaint by Mr Darwiche that the amount of drug received was less than expected. Mr Hamze is heard to enquire by ""how much money"" was it short, to which Mr Darwiche replied that it was ""missing exactly 10.""
	
	
	Detective Evans related this conversation to the amount of methylamphetamine found later in the evening in the car driven by the Melbourne purchasers. It will be remembered that it was 413.1 grams. Detective Evans gave evidence that drugs were usually sold in kilograms, half kilograms, ounces or pounds. A pound is equivalent to 453 grams. He noted that the quantity of drug analysed was, in round figures, 40 grams short of that figure. Having regard to the purity of the drug found on analysis, he calculated that 40 grams of it would be of the value of $10,000-$12,000.
	
	
	He interpreted the figure ""10"" used by Mr Darwiche in the telephone call as a reference to $10,000. That being so, he postulated that the amount of the drug which Mr Darwiche expected to receive was 1 pound, or 453 grams, and that in the call he was complaining that it was in fact 40 grams less than that amount, the shortfall being of the value of $10,000. As he put it in evidence:
	


""To me the fact that one of the parties in this particular call says that it was - the money was exactly ten short, I interpreted that to be $10,000 and in fact the amount that was meant to be conveyed back to Melbourne was in fact meant to be a pound of methylamphetamine, being 453 grams so it was approximately 40 grams short.""


	
	In summing up the trial judge directed the jury about expert evidence, summarised the evidence of Detective Evans, including the evidence in question and the significance placed upon it by the Crown, and concluded:
	


""You are not bound to accept Detective Evans' evidence simply because he is presented as an expert. You examine the basis he gave for his opinions, his reasoning and you decide if you accept his reasoning and then if you accept his opinion.""


	
	The complaint on appeal is that this was not expert evidence, and that it intruded in an impermissible way into the fact-finding function of the jury. Detective Evans was entitled to describe the quantities in which drugs were usually sold and to give evidence of the usual monetary value of those quantities. Those were matters within his ""specialised knowledge"", based on his ""training, study or experience"": s 79(1) of the Evidence Act. However, the interpretation of the phone call and the process of reasoning linking it with the amount of drug found in the vehicle were not. They were matters for the jury to determine themselves, informed by the information about quantities and values which was within the detective's specialised knowledge. To allow Detective Evans to express the process of reasoning as he did, Mr Turnbull submitted, was to cloak it with an unwarranted mantle of expertise.
	
	
	This submission is sound, and the Crown prosecutor in this court accepted as much. She argued, however, that in the event no harm was done. The detective's calculations and assumptions were tested in cross-examination and the reliability of his reasoning was challenged by defence counsel. As she put it, this was a mathematical exercise which the jury was capable of carrying out itself, and her Honour had made it clear that it was for the jury to evaluate the detective's evidence and decide whether to accept it.
	
	
	I can see the force of that argument but, in my view, these grounds are made out. The danger posed by excursions of expert witnesses into factual matters outside their specialised knowledge has long been recognised. Mr Turnbull cited Keller v R [2006] NSWCCA 204, in which Studdert J (with whom Hall and Latham JJ agreed) considered that question at [38], albeit in a very different context from the present case. His Honour referred to R v David and Gugea (CCA, Unreported, 10 October 1995) in which the court observed (at page 8) that the ""principal objection to an expert giving evidence such as was given in the present case is that it is always liable to so influence a jury that they would not trouble to make up their own minds.""
	
	
	Given that the principal issue at the trial was whether the appellant was a participant in the drug enterprise, it may be that these grounds of appeal, standing alone, might not have led to the conviction being set aside. That, however, is not a matter about which I need express a concluded view. Plainly enough, at a retrial Detective Evans should not be permitted to give the impugned evidence.
	


Orders


	
	Finally, the Crown prosecutor argued that this is a case for the application of the proviso. Given my assessment of the Crown case in the context of the fresh evidence ground, I reject that submission. I would allow the appeal, set the conviction aside and order a new trial.
	
	
	LATHAM J: I agree with Hidden J.
	
	
	ADAMSON J: I agree with Hidden J.

		11 October 2017",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705656,R v Burton [2013] NSWCCA 335,"Judgment

1SIMPSON J: This appeal, brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions (""the Director""), pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, concerns two pre-trial evidentiary rulings, made by Graham ADCJ on 24 and 25 July 2013.

2The respondent is charged with an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900, allegedly committed on 18 May 2012. The evidentiary rulings in question relate to:


evidence of a telephone conversation between the complainant and the respondent on 12 June 2012, to be tendered by the Director;


evidence said to be evidence that the complainant had or may have had sexual experience, or taken part in sexual activity, within the meaning of s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, proposed to be adduced on behalf of the respondent by way of cross-examination of the complainant.

3Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies, relevantly, to proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the District Court. Sub-section (2) is in the following terms:

""The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies.""

4In R v Powch (1988) 14 NSWLR 136 it was held by this Court that s 5F(2) does not extend to rulings on evidence, which are essentially procedural and are not ""interlocutory judgments or orders"": see also R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213; R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 639. But see, further, R v Bozatsis; R v Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296, where it was held that, in some cases, rulings on evidence are of such a character as to constitute judgments or orders, a possibility also recognised in Steffan. 

5In order to overcome perceived injustice, or potential injustice, to the Crown caused by erroneous adverse rulings on evidence, in 2003 s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act was amended by the insertion of sub-s (3A), which is in the following terms:

""The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case.""

The concluding words of the sub-section create a jurisdictional barrier: the Crown's right of appeal with respect to a ""decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence"" is limited to the circumstance where ""the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution's case"": R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228.

6By the presentation of his Notice of Appeal invoking only sub-s (3A) of s 5F, the Director acknowledges that neither of the challenged rulings is ""an interlocutory judgment or order"" within s 5F(2), and that each is a ""ruling on the admissibility of evidence"" within s 5F(3A). On appeal he did not depart from that position. In respect of each ruling, he is required to pass the jurisdictional barrier.

7The Director relied upon the decision of this Court in R v Nguyen, John Viet; R v Nguyen, Anthony Si [2010] NSWCCA 97 (per Hodgson JA, with whom Latham and Johnson JJ agreed) for the proposition that in cases of multiple challenges to evidentiary rulings brought by the Director under s 5F(3A), for the purpose of applying the jurisdictional test, this Court may have regard to the cumulative effect of any of the rulings that are held to be erroneous. 

8Senior counsel for the respondent directly questioned the correctness of that ruling, acknowledging that, if Nguyen is to be reconsidered by this Court, conventional protocol would call for a Court comprising five judges to be convened. Since the issue only arose contingently, no steps were taken in that regard. It was proposed that the same course be taken as was taken in DAO v R [2011] NSWCCA 63; 81 NSWLR 568 - where, when a similar issue presented during the course of the hearing, two additional judges joined the Court, but, with the agreement of the parties, considered the matter on the papers, without the need for further oral hearing or argument. In this case, senior counsel for the respondent was unable to agree to that course. The question of the composition of the Court was left in abeyance, to be dealt with if and when it became necessary to reconsider the correctness of Nguyen.

9The Director's notice of appeal is in the following terms:

""I ... 

HEREBY GIVE NOTICE that I desire to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the decisions or rulings set out below made by his Honour Acting Judge Graham in the District Court on 24 and 25 July 2013, 

ON THE GROUND that his Honour erred in excluding the evidence of a recorded telephone call between the accused and [the complainant], and 

ON THE GROUND that his Honour was in error in permitting evidence of prior sexual experience pursuant to s 293(4)(a) NSW Criminal Procedure Act 1986

DECISIONS OR RULINGS APPEALED AGAINST

His Honour's exclusion of a recorded telephone call between the [respondent] and [the complainant] pursuant to s 90 and s 137 of the NSW Evidence Act 1995.

His Honour's permitting of evidence of prior sexual experience pursuant to s 293(4)(a) NSW Criminal Procedure Act 1986

...""

The Crown case

10What follows is a brief account of the case the Crown proposes to make at trial.

11The complainant was born in 1979. In 2011, when she was 32 years of age, she worked as an event organiser. In the course of that work she met and became friendly with a man called Patrick McManus. Through Mr McManus the complainant met the respondent, who is a relative of Mr McManus.

12The respondent was the captain and manager of a luxury commercial charter yacht called Aqua Bay that was moored at Blackwattle Bay in Glebe. He lived on the yacht with his teenage son.

13Early in 2012 the respondent offered work to the complainant as a stewardess on the Aqua Bay. By February 2012 the complainant was working fulltime on the yacht. The respondent showed a clear sexual interest in the complainant. The complainant rebuffed his advances in clear and unequivocal terms. From March to May 2012 the complainant undertook a small business management course. On 17 May she completed her last assignment for the course. She planned to celebrate the occasion on the Aqua Bay, in the company of the respondent, and she invited Mr McManus. The three consumed champagne on the yacht, and then attended a local Glebe restaurant for dinner. They then travelled to Kings Cross where they went, sequentially, to two bars and two strip clubs, and an ""adult shop"". 

14At about 2am on the morning of 18 May, the three returned to the Aqua Bay. The respondent invited the complainant to stay overnight on the yacht. She agreed to do so, having ascertained that Mr McManus would also stay overnight. All three sat in a lounge area of the yacht. The complainant fell asleep, the men on either side of her.

15At some stage during the night Mr McManus left the area to sleep in another part of the yacht. The complainant woke to find the respondent performing cunnilingus on her. The complainant left the yacht, despite attempts by the respondent to have her stay. She drove home.

16Later that day, she received several text messages from the respondent. Two of the messages concerned proposed arrangements for her to work on the Aqua Bay. The third was an invitation to a dance party on another yacht. The respondent also left two voice messages on the complainant's telephone. In none of the messages did the respondent make any mention of the events on the yacht. Although it is not stated explicitly, it appears that the complainant did not respond to any of the messages, or return the calls.

17On Saturday, 19 May the complainant had dinner with a former boyfriend, to whom she confided what happened on the yacht. This was the first complaint she had made about the incident. The following day, 20 May, she telephoned Mr McManus and told him what had happened. On 24 May she received another work related text message from the respondent. Again, he made no mention of the incident on the yacht. The complainant did not reply to the message.

18On 29 May the complainant contacted the North Sydney Sexual Assault Service at the Royal North Shore Hospital and spoke to a counsellor. She described what had happened on the yacht. On 30 May the respondent sent the complainant another text message. It was in the following terms:

""Hi [first name of complainant], would really like to talk to you about what happened. I truly hope it has not affected our friendship and working relationship with each other. Circumstances on the night with the over ingestion of alcohol perhaps led me to believe that we were both looking for the same thing. [First name of complainant] I do sincerely apologise if I have offended you. I have left a couple of messages that you have not responded to so I guess it has. Hopefully we can overcome this as I do value your friendship. Looking forward to your reply, Brian.""

19With the help of a sexual assault counsellor, the complainant reported the matter to police. 

20On 12 June 2012, at the instigation of investigating police, the complainant telephoned the respondent. The conversation that ensued was recorded pursuant to a listening device warrant issued under the Surveillance Devices Act 2007. The transcript of the conversation is as follows:

""Complainant: Hi Brian how are you going?

Respondent: Good, how are you doing?

Complainant: Not too bad ... um, you sent me a text message, a few text messages.

Respondent: Yeah, you been away have ya?

Complainant: Um no, yeah, just busy got a lot of stuff on, yep.

Respondent: Okay.

Complainant: What did you want to talk about?

Respondent: Um I'm back down on Friday if you want to catch up.

Complainant: Right, well, I would prefer to talk on the phone.

Respondent: All right, um, I've got shocking reception where I am, so I will give you a call when I get back down.

Complainant: Alright well, I would prefer to have a chat now, I've just sort of got quite a few things on and I'm actually going away later this week, so I just want to, I would prefer to talk now.

Respondent: Oh, okay um 

Complainant: I can hear you fine so reception is not an issue.

Respondent: What's that sorry

Complainant: I said I can hear you fine so reception is not an issue.

Respondent: Oh, okay, alright, um, you have caught me unawares, um basically really I want to apologise, umm, maybe there were some crossed wires there, I'd like to think that we could still be friends and forget about all that

Complainant: You broke that trust, why would you? Why would you do something like that?

Respondent: Um, could I ring you back a little bit later this afternoon, um I'm in the middle of something.

Complainant: I just really, I just really want to find out, why on earth, what made you do that? I just really, I'm just so confused.

Respondent: Yeah, um 

Complainant: What compelled you to do something like that? I warned you before, you know, you were one of my closest friends. Brian, you were my mentor, you were a good friend of mine, and you broke that trust.

Respondent: Um, I think it was just signals on the day, [first name of complainant], um um

Complainant: I gave you no signals at all, there was a number of times I told you when we standing on the afterdeck, after a charter or whatever and I just said to you, I said we would never, as much as I like you Brian as a friend that would never ever happen numerous times. And you know, I, I don't understand what part of no you don't get.

Respondent: I apologise [first name of complainant], um, while I was laying there, I don't know whether you were doing anything, asleep or whatever. Your leg, my arm, your leg against my arm, and I don't know, the alcohol

Complainant: I was asleep, I was asleep, you didn't even given me how can you do that? I have to go, I'm so upset, sorry. Sorry."" (italics added)

(The Crown asserts that the final statement attributed to the respondent is wrongly transcribed, and should read:

""I apologise ... um, while I was laying there you were, I don't know whether you were doing it in your asleep or whatever ...""

During the hearing of the appeal, the tape recording was played, and senior counsel for the respondent accepted that the Crown's version is correct. As well, the words ""numerous times"" can be heard in that part of the conversation where the complainant reminded the respondent that she had told him that they would never have a sexual relationship.)

21So far as the evidence in this appeal goes, that is the evidence on which the Crown will rely at trial.

Other evidentiary material

22Patrick McManus has made two statements relevant to the proceedings. It is not the Crown's intention to call him as a witness in its case.

23Mr McManus worked casually on Aqua Bay as a deck hand and relief skipper. In his first (undated) statement he wrote of his association with the complainant, which commenced in about August or September 2011 when he met her at a social function of which she was the coordinator. He said that they developed a friendship and he attended other events which she coordinated. He said that at the end of most of those nights they finished the night having drinks together. On one such occasion they became ""intimate"". 

24He wrote of other occasions when he and the complainant socialised together, on some of which they engaged sexually, although the relationship was not exclusive. 

25Mr McManus recounted his version of the events of 17-18 May. Relevantly for present purposes, he described the excursion to Kings Cross. He said that, at the first bar the three visited, they had had ""a number"" of drinks, and that it was the complainant who suggested locating a strip club.

26He said that at the second bar they attended, the complainant exhibited sexual interest in a man she met there, who had previously been a stranger to her. He did not reciprocate her interest. Mr McManus asserts that the complainant said:

""That was weird, he just wasn't interested.""

(This was contained in paragraph 18 of his statement.)

He said that they left the bar, and eventually went to another. The same man was present, this time, with ""a couple of hostesses"". According to Mr McManus, the complainant pointed out the man, and said:

""Why would he go with them when he could have had me for free?""

(This was contained in paragraph 22 of his statement.)

27Mr McManus also described an incident that he said took place outside a ""gentleman's club"". He said that a female out the front invited them in, but that he and the respondent declined. He said that the complainant struck up a conversation with the woman, who they soon discovered was a ""working girl"", which I take to mean ""prostitute"". He said that the complainant asked the woman a lot of questions about her business and her rates and the sex industry generally.

28Mr McManus said that the complainant was ""paying attention"" to the respondent, and that he (Mr McManus) ""wasn't really in the conversation"". He formed the impression that the complainant was ""interested in"" the respondent (sexually).

29Mr McManus referred to a telephone call from the complainant a few days later. He said that she did not, in that conversation, make any mention of an assault on her by the respondent.

30In his second statement, made on 22 July 2013, Mr McManus recounted that the respondent had denied the complainant's allegations, and suggested that the complainant had suffered financial loss as a result of a Fashion Week venture that had failed. The clear import is a suggestion that the complainant's allegations against the respondent were made in the hope of obtaining a payment under Victims' Compensation provisions.

The proceedings at first instance

31The trial was fixed to commence in the District Court on 24 July 2013. On that day, the solicitors representing the respondent notified the Office of the Director that they proposed to seek leave pursuant to s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to cross-examine the complainant on certain identified topics. Section 293 prohibits, subject to exceptions, the admission, in sexual offence prosecutions, of evidence concerning the complainant's sexual history. Its relevant terms are set out below. The topics identified as the subject of the proposed cross-examination were:

""(1) The complainant's relationship with Mr Patrick McManus in terms of:

(a) the nature of their general relationship;

(b) whether or not that relationship involved sexual activity;

(c) was such activity isolated or had it occurred on more than one occasion;

(d) had such activity been followed by the complainant and Mr McManus sleeping overnight together (including the activities on the Aqua Bay on the night it was anchored at Athol Bay);

(e) the complainant's responses to Mr McManus in the days following any such sexual activity.

(2) The complainant's conduct on the evening of 17th May 2012 and the morning of 18th May 2012 in terms of:

(a) her interaction with an unknown male at 'Vegas Bar and Grill' and later at the 'Badabing' strip club and associated comments.""

32The sole basis on which it was sought to adduce this evidence was to lay a foundation for an inference that the complainant had consented to the sexual activities with the respondent.

33A voir dire was conducted on 24 and 25 July. The issues for determination were:

(i)the admissibility of evidence proposed to be adduced in cross-examination of the complainant of the asserted prior sexual relationship with Mr McManus. The particular import of this evidence was explained as lying in the suggestion that the complainant, after sexual engagement with Mr McManus always, or usually, expressed regret that she had done so. Although no evidence was tendered in this respect, counsel for the respondent said:

""At the moment there is no apparent motive to lie, if I can put it that way, and I'll be as frank as I can, I'm still in two minds as to whether to even go there but there is on my - as indicated to myself and my instructing solicitor in conference last week, that on each and every occasion the complainant would in the days following any sexual encounter express regret, indicate, 'look, it shouldn't have happened. That was unprofessional. We're work colleagues' etcetera etcetera and matters of that nature"";

(ii)the admissibility of evidence proposed to be adduced in cross-examination concerning the complainant's sexual interest in the stranger at the Kings Cross venues, and the comments made by her in that respect;

(iii)the admissibility of the evidence of the telephone conversation between the complainant and the respondent on 12 June 2012.

The complainant gave evidence on the voir dire as did Detective Senior Constable Michael Egan-Hurst, the officer in charge of the investigation.

34The evidence of the complainant and Detective Egan-Hurst on the voir dire was directed only to the admissibility of the recording of the telephone conversation. The call was made as part of the police investigation strategy.

35The call was initiated by the complainant on a mobile telephone from a room at the premises of Police Marine Area Command at Balmain. Present in the room were the complainant, Detective Egan-Hurst, and another police officer, Caroline Eades (who had taken the statement made by the complainant, and was present as support for her). The conversation was recorded by a device taped to the mobile telephone on which the complainant made the call. The device recorded, but did not amplify, the conversation. The complainant's side of the conversation was audible to the police officers as it proceeded. The respondent's side of the conversation was not. At the conclusion of the conversation Detective Egan-Hurst listened to the recording, and later transcribed it.

36The complainant gave evidence first. She perceived, as she said repeatedly, that the purpose of the call was:

""To ascertain why [the respondent] did it."" 

Even when asked directly in cross-examination whether, in discussion with police officers about the proposal to make the call, a hope had been expressed that the respondent would make relevant admissions of criminal conduct, she maintained that:

""I just wanted to know what possessed him to do that."" 

It was also suggested to her that police officers had prompted or directed her in what to say, but she denied this.

37In his evidence, Detective Egan-Hurst explained the process by which the surveillance device warrant had been obtained. He acknowledged that the purpose of the call, and of recording it, was to capture any admission that might be made by the respondent. In this respect, he was quite clear, both in his evidence in chief, and in cross-examination, that he believed (because of the pre-existing and ongoing relationship between the complainant and the respondent) that they would, at some stage, be in contact, and that a conversation about the events would take place. His purpose in having the complainant make the call in the manner she did was to ensure that anything the respondent said would be ""captured"". He accepted that, by the time of the call, he ""possibly"" had sufficient evidence (in the complainant's statement) to lay a charge against the respondent, but said, in effect, that he wished to strengthen the prosecution case before doing so. He had not spoken to the respondent previously, because he did not wish to alert him to the investigation. He did not consider speaking to the respondent before the call to be an option; he wished to investigate further before speaking to him. While he could have spoken to the respondent earlier, he would have considered that ""an error"". He acknowledged that the complainant had asked for advice about how to start the conversation (he suggested she ask about the text message of 30 May) but otherwise denied prompting, or making suggestions of topics of conversation to the complainant.

38He said that he made the decision to charge the respondent after listening to and the transcribing of the recording of the conversation.

39It is worth noting that no submission was put to Graham ADCJ that he ought not to accept the evidence of either the complainant or Detective Egan-Hurst, and his Honour made no express findings of fact. He made a general observation that there were, in the evidence of the two witnesses some discrepancies ""particularly in relation to the inception and execution of the telephone call"", and, to the extent of the discrepancies, preferred the evidence of Detective Egan-Hurst. He did not identify the discrepancies, and they do not appear to be of any moment so far as the present issues are concerned. This Court should proceed on the basis that the evidence given by both witnesses was accepted as reliable. 

40The argument on the voir dire was somewhat unstructured. However, some things emerged from it. At an early stage of the voir dire, counsel for the respondent identified the relevance of the evidence of the complainant's interest in the stranger as indicating ""signals from the complainant on the evening and what effect that had on the state of mind of the [respondent] at approximately 6am the following morning"". Later and more explicitly, he declared that the issue in the trial would be consent. He made no mention of any issue concerning belief by the respondent that the complainant consented to his sexual advances, nor to any lack of knowledge on his part that the complainant was not consenting. Those matters, however, remain as potential issues in the trial.

41Although Graham ADCJ expressed reservations about whether the evidence fell within s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act both parties approached issues (i) and (ii) (see para [33] above) on the basis that that was the relevant statutory provision, and ultimately, that was the basis on which his Honour determined that the evidence would be admitted. That, in my opinion, was incorrect, for reasons I set out below.

42In his judgment of 24 July, Graham ADCJ rejected the evidence falling into the first category - that is, the asserted sexual relationship between the complainant and Mr McManus, and her asserted subsequent pattern of behaviour in expressing regret for participation. That evidence is no longer in issue.

43However, in the same judgment, his Honour granted leave to counsel for the respondent to adduce the evidence of the complainant's conduct at the Kings Cross venues, her sexual interest in the male stranger, and the comments she made concerning him and her apparent willingness to participate in a sexual encounter with him. He did this on the bases, first, that the evidence was relevant, and, second, that it came within one of the exceptions to s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act.

44In a judgment delivered on 25 July Graham ADCJ rejected the evidence the Crown proposed to call of the telephone conversation between the complainant and the respondent on 12 June. 

45Each of these rulings is the subject of the Director's Notice of Appeal. It is convenient to deal with the two separate issues in the sequence in which they were decided in the District Court.

46Having regard to the conclusions I have reached, it is fair to note the circumstances in which his Honour delivered the judgments. 24 July was the day fixed for the commencement of the trial. It was only on that day that notice of the evidentiary issues was given. No doubt a jury panel had been assembled, and was waiting. On that day, his Honour heard the evidence of the complainant, and argument concerning the sexual history evidence. He delivered judgment (presumably ex-tempore) on the same day. On 25 July he heard the evidence of Detective Egan-Hurst and argument on the admissibility of the telephone conversation. Again, he delivered judgment on the same day. There was undoubtedly pressure to dispose of the evidentiary issues in order that the trial could commence. It was only when the Crown prosecutor signalled an intention to challenge the rulings that the trial date was vacated.

(i) The evidence sought to be adduced concerning the complainant's alleged sexual history (judgment 24 July 2013)

47The evidence in question was the evidence in paragraphs 18 and 22 of Mr McManus' statement (concerning the complainant's apparent sexual interest in the man she met in the Kings Cross bar). The principal basis for his Honour's decision to admit the evidence was that he considered it came within the exception provided by s 293(4)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act. 

48Section 293 is a complex provision. It applies to proceedings in respect of a prescribed sexual offence (sub-s (1)), of which sexual intercourse without consent is one. Because of the complexity of the section, I will extract only those parts of it which bear upon the present case.

""293(2) Evidence relating to the sexual reputation of the complainant is inadmissible. 
(3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 
(a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or 
(b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, 
is inadmissible. 

(4) Subsection (3) does not apply: 
(a) if the evidence: 
(i) is of the complainant's sexual experience or lack of sexual experience, or of sexual activity or lack of sexual activity taken part in by the complainant, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, and 
(ii) is of events that are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged prescribed sexual offence was committed, 
(b) ... 
(c) ...
(d) ... 
(e) ... 
(f) ...
and if the probative value of the evidence outweighs any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. 

(5) A witness must not be asked: 
(a) to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or (3), or 
(b) by or on behalf of the accused person, to give evidence that is or may be admissible under subsection (4) unless the court has previously decided that the evidence would, if given, be admissible. 

(6) ... 

(7) ... 

(8) If the court decides that evidence is admissible under subsection (4), the court must, before the evidence is given, record or cause to be recorded in writing the nature and scope of the evidence that is so admissible and the reasons for that decision.""

The reasons given for admitting the evidence

49I now turn to consider, in some detail, the reasons given by his Honour for his decision to admit the evidence.

50His Honour considered the evidence of the complainant's interaction with the female at the ""gentleman's club"" to be:

""... of some relevance in establishing the context and tone of the outlook of the complainant on that evening"". 

He considered that evidence to be relevant to the respondent's later text message, in which he had said that ""the over ingestion of alcohol perhaps led me to believe that we were both looking for the same thing"". He then referred to Mr McManus' observations and his conclusion that the complainant had been exhibiting a sexual interest in the respondent.

51His Honour said:

""The additional context which is said to flow from [Mr McManus'] statement relates to observations or conclusions which he drew during the course of the evening as to the fact that the complainant had been paying a lot of attention to the [respondent], so that he [Mr McManus] thought at the time that the complainant was interested in the [respondent].

The issue in this case being consent, the allegation put is that the reference to the man going with hostesses when he could have had the complainant for free provides part of the context upon from (sic) which the [respondent] may have picked up signals about a general sexual willingness on the part of the complainant. The additional context, of course, relates to the celebratory nature of the evening and the visits to various places of interest in the Kings Cross area.

The material in paragraphs 18 and 22 [see para [26] above] in particular, certainly in the general context, does in my view have significant probative value which would outweigh any prejudicial effect of it, in that it would have provided the [respondent] with some insight at least into the general thinking of the complainant on that evening. That, in turn, might act as some sort of antidote to the evidence that the complainant had, in the past, expressly disavowed any interest in intimacy with the [respondent]. That is evidence which, in my view, is relevant and probative in the general sense. The question is whether it is also caught by s 293 and, if it is, whether any exception applies to it.""

52His Honour then expressly held the material to be relevant, and returned to consider whether it came within s 293(3), and was therefore (subject to any exception) inadmissible. He continued to express doubts about that, but nevertheless went on to hold that the evidence came within the exception provided by s 293(4)(a). That is the exception that allows the admission of evidence of sexual activity or experience on the part of the complainant if it is evidence of contemporaneous (that is, at or about the time of the commission of the alleged sexual offence) sexual activity or experience (referred to by his Honour as ""the temporal test"", and is of events forming part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged sexual offence was committed (referred to by his Honour as ""the connection test"").

53In this respect, he said:

""So the evidence meets the temporal test in sub-para (1) and it also, in my view, meets the connection test in sub-para (2). It is evidence of events forming part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged offence was committed, in other words the connection is the attitude towards sexual availability indicated by the complainant in her encounter with the stranger at the club and the formation by the accused of a belief, which may have been mistaken, as to consent on the part of the complainant. There is, in my view, sufficient connection, in that sense between what occurred in the club and what occurred two to three hours later in the boat to say that, in a practical sense, the earlier events form part of connected set of circumstances in which what is said to have been a sexual offence was committed.""

He went on to declare himself satisfied that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. He therefore concluded that the material fell within the exception in s 293(4)(a), and should be admitted. It is that conclusion that the Director challenges by the second ground of appeal.

The competing positions of the parties on appeal

54The primary position of the Director, both at first instance and on appeal, was that the evidence was not (and could not have been) relevant, and ought, therefore, to have been excluded under s 56 of the Evidence Act 1995 (see below).

55The Director's alternative position on appeal was that the evidence falls within s 293(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act (and is, therefore, prima facie inadmissible) and does not come within the exception provided for by s 293(4)(a).

56On behalf of the respondent it was contended that the evidence was:

""... clearly relevant to the state of mind of the respondent at the time of the alleged offence.""

57Senior counsel expressly adopted and endorsed that part of the judgment in which the judge said that the evidence:

""... provides part of the context upon from [sic] which the [respondent] may have picked up signals about a general sexual willingness on the part of the complainant""

and submitted (with respect to the relevance of the evidence) that the evidence needs to be seen in the wider context of Mr McManus' statement to the effect that the complainant was showing particular interest in the respondent.

58The submissions on behalf of the respondent attacked the Director's submissions on relevance by pointing out that they made no reference to Mr McManus' observations of the complainant's apparent sexual interest in the respondent, and were therefore deficient.

59A secondary position adopted on behalf of the respondent was that the evidence does not fall within s 293(3), as it is not evidence that discloses or implies either that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or lack thereof, or has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity.

60It was further contended that, if the evidence is within s 293(3), it was open to his Honour to find that the evidence met both the temporal test and the connection test.

Analysis 

61The starting point in any determination concerning the admissibility of evidence is s 56 of the Evidence Act 1995, which provides that, except as otherwise provided in the Evidence Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible, and evidence that is not relevant is not admissible.

62By s 55, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. The ""fact in issue"" in the trial the existence of which the evidence in question was said to be rationally capable of affecting was the element of the offence charged that the complainant did not consent to sexual activity with the respondent. (As I have mentioned above, although a brief allusion was made to the respondent's state of mind during the course of argument, no mention was made of any question of absence of knowledge or lack of consent or of any belief by the respondent that the complainant was consenting. Nevertheless, those potential issues must be borne in mind.)

63It is difficult to understand what relevant test his Honour had in mind in the conclusion contained in the third of the paragraphs extracted above (see para [51]) - that the evidence in paras 18 and 22 of Mr McManus' first statement (that is, of the complainant's remarks concerning the man in whom she showed a sexual interest) had ""significant probative value"" that ""outweigh[ed] any prejudicial effect of it"". It seems to reflect an amalgam of the tests posed by the Evidence Act in s 97 (tendency evidence), s 101 (restriction on the use of tendency evidence adduced by the prosecution in criminal proceedings) and s 137 (exclusion of evidence adduced by the prosecution in criminal proceedings where the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence). The evidence in question is evidence sought to be adduced on behalf of the respondent. Accordingly, neither s 101 nor s 137 can have any application. Section 97 imposes a restriction on evidence adduced for the purpose of proving a tendency on the part of a person to act in a particular way or to have a particular state of mind, rendering evidence inadmissible unless it has significant probative value. It may well be that the proper characterisation of the purpose for which the evidence was sought to be adduced, through the complainant, on behalf of the respondent, was to establish a tendency on the part of the complainant to act in a particular way (to engage in sexual activity) or to have a particular state of mind (presumably interest in or willingness to engage in, sexual activity) but, if so, that was never articulated. Section 97 does not include any countervailing question concerning the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence.

64It may also be that his Honour took the view that this evidence did establish a tendency on the part of the complainant to engage in sexual activity, regardless of the identity of any person with whom she engaged. That possibility is supported by his reference in the preceding paragraph to ""a general sexual willingness on the part of the complainant"", and the later reference to ""sexual availability evidenced by the complainant"". Whatever may be read into the reasoning, his Honour did not purport to admit the evidence as tendency evidence. 

65Although the issues as presented to the judge were limited to proposed cross-examination of the complainant, it is appropriate to bear in mind that there may also be an attempt to call evidence from Mr McManus. The following reasoning is applicable to evidence adduced by either means.

66The judgment is flawed in a number of respects.

67First, the evidence was not, and was not capable of being, relevant. The issue in the trial, as declared by counsel for the respondent, was whether, in the early hours of 18 May 2012, the complainant had in fact consented to sexual connection (by cunnilingus) with the respondent. It is proper to broaden that inquiry to include questions concerning the respondent's knowledge (or lack thereof) that the complainant was not consenting (in the event that it would be proved that she was not), or his belief that she was consenting (again, in the event that it would be proved that she was not).

68That the complainant had exhibited sexual interest in another man (whether or not at or near the time the offence is alleged to have been committed) is irrelevant to any question concerning her consent to sexual engagement with the respondent.

69In this determination, I exclude from consideration both the complainant's evidence of her earlier rejection of the respondent's advances, and her evidence that, when the respondent performed the act of cunnilingus upon her, she was asleep. Those matters are allegations made by the Crown, but remain unproved. They do not bear upon the admissibility of the evidence in paragraphs 18 and 22 of Mr McManus' statement. The issue is a simple one: it is now clearly understood that the willingness of a person (whether male or female) to participate in sexual activity with one person does not, and cannot be taken to, connote willingness to participate in sexual activity with another. For the same reason, the evidence is not relevant either to the respondent's knowledge (or lack thereof) of the absence of consent by the complainant, or any belief in her consent that he might assert.

70The judge's conclusions that the evidence indicated ""a general sexual willingness on the part of the complainant"", and that it ""might act as some sort of antidote to the evidence that the complainant had, in the past expressly disavowed any interest in intimacy with the [respondent]"" betrays an impermissible approach to the question of consent in the prosecution of allegations of sexual offences. The reasoning contains an unstated premise. The unstated premise is that a person who engages sexually with another person will, or is likely to, engage sexually with any other person. It is a patently false premise. Section 293 was introduced into the legislation (originally as s 409B of the Crimes Act 1900) for the specific purpose of putting an end to offensive and demeaning cross-examination that proceeded on the basis that evidence of consent by a person (then invariably female) to sexual engagement with one person (person A) provided the foundation for an inference that that person also consented to sexual engagement with another person (person B). That process of reasoning has been banned from the criminal courts, first by s 409B of the Crimes Act, and subsequently by s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. Yet that is precisely the process of reasoning disclosed in the passages of the judgment set out above, and the inference that was explicitly drawn. That inference was the basis for the decision to admit the evidence of the complainant's sexual interest in the stranger at Kings Cross.

71The submissions made on behalf of the respondent, that the proposed evidence ""needs to be seen in the wider context in which the complainant was showing particular interest in the respondent"" perpetuates the erroneous approach. Potential evidence that the complainant exhibited an interest in the respondent was not in issue on the appeal. Such evidence (if in proper form) would almost certainly be admissible, supposing that the respondent asserted that the complainant consented, that he did not know that she did not consent, or that he believed that she did consent. It was the inferences to be drawn from her apparent interest in another man that were in issue. Those inferences - as sought on behalf of the respondent - were that, because of her apparent interest in the stranger, she was ""sexually available"", or that it signified ""general sexual willingness"", or that her sexual interest (availability) was ""general"". Those inferences were simply not permissible. Evidence that the complainant showed signs of sexual interest in the respondent could not be strengthened by evidence that she showed signs of sexual interest in another man. 

72The evidence was not relevant and ought to have been excluded on that basis. The finding that the evidence was relevant was erroneous.

73Section 293 is applicable to evidence that otherwise would be admissible and of probative value: R v Morgan (1993) NSWLR 543, per Gleeson CJ at 544. However, since s 293(4)(a) was the basis upon which his Honour determined to admit the evidence, it is necessary to deal with the relevant findings of fact and conclusions. 

74Since I have concluded that the evidence was not relevant and therefore had no probative value, s 293 was not engaged. Even if it were, the judge's expressed concern as to whether the evidence fell within sub-s (3) was well founded. To come within the s 293(3) exception, the evidence had to disclose or imply one (or more) of the following:


that the complainant has had sexual experience;
that the complainant may have had sexual experience;
that the complainant lacked sexual experience;
that the complainant may have lacked sexual experience;
that the complainant has taken part in sexual activity;
that the complainant has not taken part in sexual activity;
that the complainant may have taken part in sexual activity;
that the complainant may not have taken part in sexual activity.

75The most that could be drawn from the content of Mr McManus' statement (on which the proposed cross-examination would be based) is that the complainant exhibited sexual interest in a man she met in a Kings Cross bar. That falls far short of sexual experience or sexual activity, or lack thereof.

76Had the judge properly considered s 293(3), he would have rejected the contention that the evidence fell within that sub-section. That would have precluded the subsequent excursion into the exception provided by sub-s (4)(a). The second error in the decision to admit the evidence lay in failing to make an explicit finding on that question. One consequence was that the judge did not identify into which of the various categories of sub-s (3) the evidence fell - whether it was sexual experience or lack thereof; whether it was sexual activity or lack thereof; whether the evidence implied or disclosed that the applicant had or may have had either. 

77Since the evidence did not come within s 293(3), there was no call to examine the exception provided by s 293(4)(a).

78The third error lay in the application of sub-s (4)(a)(i), that is, in the finding that the evidence related to sexual experience or sexual activity ""at or about the time of the commission of the offence"".

79The proposed evidence was that the encounter with the stranger had taken place at some time in the early hours of the morning at Kings Cross. Much occurred in between that encounter and the events giving rise to the charge against the respondent. The party had returned to the boat, had settled on a sofa, and the complainant had fallen asleep. Mr McManus had left the area to sleep elsewhere. The complainant's encounter with the man in the bar (the subject of the evidence sought to be adduced) did not take place ""at or about the time"" of the events giving rise to the charge. Several hours intervened.

80The fourth error concerned the application of sub-s (4)(a)(ii). It lay in the conclusion that the two events (that is, the meeting with the stranger and the complainant's sexual interest in him, and the alleged offence) ""form[ed] part of a connected set of circumstances"". The only connection between the events was the presence of the respondent, the complainant, and Mr McManus throughout the evening. There was no relevant connection between the complainant's asserted interest in the stranger and the circumstances in which the offence allegedly was committed by the respondent.



Conclusion

81In my opinion, the decision to admit the evidence was wrong. The evidence was inadmissible. It remains to consider whether the ruling on the evidence passes the jurisdictional test created by the concluding words of s 5F(3A). I will come to that below. 

(ii) The evidence of the telephone conversation between the complainant and the respondent on 12 June 2012

82The Crown tendered the tape recording of the telephone conversation on the basis that it contained admissions on the part of the respondent. ""Admission"" is widely defined in the Dictionary to the Evidence Act 1995 as:

""a previous representation that is: 
(a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding), and 
(b) adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding.""

83The Crown position was that that part of the conversation in which the respondent apologised to the complainant and said:

""... um basically really I want to apologise, umm, maybe there were some crossed wires there, I'd like to think that we could still be friends and forget about all that"",

and:

""... I think it was just signals on the day ..."",

and:

""I apologise ... while I was laying there you were, I don't know whether you were doing it in your sleep or whatever. Your leg, my arm, your leg against my arm, and I don't know, the alcohol.""

could be construed as admissions of wrongdoing, including criminal wrongdoing. For the purpose of the reasoning with respect to this ground of appeal, I will treat the respondent's statements as constituting admissions.

84Objection was taken on behalf of the respondent to the admission of the evidence on four independent bases provided for in the Evidence Act. The bases were:

s 85, which restricts the admission of evidence of admissions made in the course of ""official questioning"", or as a result of an act of another person who is capable of influencing the decision whether or not a prosecution should be brought or should be continued;


s 90, which confers on the court a discretion to refuse to admit evidence of an admission where the evidence is adduced by the prosecution and:

""... having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence"";


s 137, which obliges a court in a criminal proceeding to refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecution if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant;


s 138, which confers a discretion to exclude evidence improperly or illegally obtained. 

85Graham ADCJ did not decide the objection under s 85; that section need not be considered. His Honour held that, for the purposes of s 138, the evidence was not illegally or improperly obtained, and therefore that section had no application.

86He rejected the evidence under s 137, and also held that it ought to be rejected under s 90. It is therefore necessary to consider his reasoning in respect of these two provisions.

Section 90: admissions

87Section 90 is in the following terms:

""90 Discretion to exclude admissions 
In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
(a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution, and 
(b) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence. 
Note: Part 3.11 contains other exclusionary discretions that are applicable to admissions."" 

88Section 90 is a statutory formulation of a longstanding common law discretion to exclude, in a criminal trial, evidence that has been obtained in circumstances that would render its admission unfair: see, for example, McDermott v The King [1948] HCA 23; 76 CLR 501; Wendo v The Queen [1963] HCA 19; 109 CLR 559; Cleland v The Queen [1982] HCA 67; 151 CLR 1; The Queen v Swaffield; Pavic v The Queen [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159.

89It may be observed that s 90 is directed to the circumstances in which the admission was made; unlike s 137, which will be considered below, it does not call for any assessment of the probative value of the evidence.

The reasons given for rejecting the evidence under s 90

90Graham ADCJ, with some expressed reservations, concluded that what was said by the respondent to the complainant:

""... could amount to an admission of some aspects of some form of sexual offence.""

Whether the respondent's apology is to be construed as an admission of wrongdoing will be a matter for the jury. 

91His Honour concluded that the discretion conferred by s 90 ought to be exercised in favour of the respondent, by the rejection of the evidence. His reasons appear to be encapsulated in the following passages in the judgment:

""... the [respondent] was engaged in what appeared to be a genuine and indeed emotional telephone conversation which was consistent with the follow up to his invitation in the apology text message to invite the complainant to discuss the issues with him. He was not conscious that the complainant was engaging in this conversation at the instigation of the police, nor, of course, was he informed that he had a right to remain silent or to speak as he saw fit. No caution had been administered to him in the course of the conversation obviously, nor at any previous time once the investigation had got under way. Indeed ultimately, when the [respondent] was arrested, he chose to exercise that right to silence. There is, in other words, strong ground for believing that, had he been informed that the conversation was at the behest of the police and was being recorded, he would have declined to participate in it once he realised that this was not a genuine attempt by the complainant to discuss the issues with him but was, in fact, an evidence gathering exercise.

The complainant was, I am satisfied, a person who should be regarded as an agent of the State ... true it is that her conversation was not scripted, though the key purpose of it, and perhaps the key question, was conveyed to her by the police so that what she was asking was, in effect, what the police would themselves have wished to ask, had they been confident that the [respondent] would speak to them if they sought to interview him.

In my view the circumstances here did amount to an unfair derogation of the [respondent's] right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent. He was clearly a suspect and the police already had evidence which could have been sufficient to bring a charge and what he said was, in fact, the catalyst for the charge ultimately being brought against him. The conversation was directed to getting him to say something along the lines of what he said and was thus elicited and elicited by a person who was, for these purposes, an agent of the State. Whilst it might be said that that was a somewhat loose relationship of agency it was, in my view, nonetheless such a relationship. 

Secondly, the question is whether the line has been crossed by the police exploiting any special characteristics of the relationship between the suspect and their agent, so as to extract a statement which would not otherwise have been made. Clearly, the officer in charge anticipated that it was more likely that the accused would make an admission to the complainant than that he would make one to the police. In seeking to fulfil that hope or expectation, in my view, the police were, in this instance, exploiting some special characteristics of the relationship between the suspect and their agent, the complainant. The exchange between them would not have taken place in the form and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the State and its agent.

...

The admissions were elicited in the sense that the conversation was the functional equivalent of an interrogation and the State agent exploited special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement ... I have already found that the police, through the complainant, did exploit those special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement.

...

In the light of those findings, it is open to this Court to conclude, and the Court does conclude that, having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to the [respondent] to use the evidence by virtue of the application of those propositions set out in the case of R v Pavitt at para 70."" (italics added)

92The italicised passages constitute findings of fact, each of which is referable to relevant considerations identified in previous authorities. To assist comprehension of the discussion that follows, I will itemise those findings of fact. They are:

(i)the respondent was not aware that the conversation took place at the instigation of police;
(ii)no caution had been administered to the respondent (with respect to his right to silence);
(iii)the complainant was acting as ""an agent of the state"";
(iv)the complainant's part of the conversation was not ""scripted"" by police, but the ""key question"" had been conveyed to her and reflected what police would have asked if they had questioned the respondent directly;
(v)the circumstances amounted to ""an unfair derogation"" of the respondent's right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent;
(vi)the admissions made by the respondent were ""elicited"", and ""elicited by a person who was, for these purposes, an agent of the state"";
(vii)in having the complainant act as their agent, the police exploited special characteristics of the relationship between the respondent and the complainant, so as to extract a statement that otherwise would not have been made;
(viii)the conversation between the complainant and the respondent would not have taken place in the form and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the State (police) and its agent (the complainant);
(ix)the conversation was ""the functional equivalent of an interrogation"" for the purpose of which the complainant ""exploited special characteristics of the relationship"" between herself and the respondent in order to extract the admission.

It was a combination of these facts that led his Honour to the conclusion, for the purposes of s 90, that it would be unfair to admit the evidence. 

The position of the parties on appeal

93The position of the Director was:


it was not correct to find that the circumstances of the telephone conversation amounted to ""an unfair derogation"" of the respondent's right to speak or remain silent. The history of events since the evening of 17 May showed that he was keen to speak to the complainant;


it was wrong to find that the complainant was acting as ""an agent of the state"";


it was wrong to find that the admissions were ""elicited""; they were consistent with the text message of 29 May;


it was wrong to find that the complainant's part in the conversation was ""the functional equivalent of an interrogation"".

94On behalf of the respondent, it was argued that the findings were correct and supported by the evidence.

Analysis

95In the final remarks extracted above from the judgment, Graham ADCJ was referring to the decision of this Court in R v Pavitt [2007] NSWCCA 88; 69 A Crim R 452 and two Canadian decisions, R v Hebert [1990] 2 SCR 151 and R v Broyles [1991] 3 SCR 595. The notion of ""an agent of the state"" appears to have originated in Broyles, in a case the circumstances of which were not dissimilar to the present. The notion of ""eliciting behaviour"" appears to have originated in Hebert, a case in which a suspect who had indicated that he did not wish to make a statement to police was placed in a prison cell with an undercover police officer to whom he made incriminating statements.

96In order to understand the significance of the manner in which Graham ADCJ's findings of fact were expressed, it is necessary to understand the origin of some of those expressions and the concepts to which they apply. I begin with the two decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. These decisions are important, because they secured the endorsement of the High Court in Swaffield and Pavic (see below). Each concerned s 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which is in the following terms:

""7 Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.""

97In Hebert, the accused was charged with robbery. He was arrested and advised of his right to retain and instruct counsel. While in custody he contacted, and obtained advice from, counsel. He was then cautioned [presumably as to his right to silence] and indicated that he did not wish to make a statement. He was then placed in a cell with a police officer, disguised in plain clothes, posing as a suspect under arrest. The police officer engaged the accused in conversation, during which the accused made incriminating statements, implicating himself in the robbery with which he was charged.

98The trial judge declined to admit the evidence, as a consequence of which the accused was acquitted. The Crown successfully appealed, and a new trial was ordered. The accused appealed to the Supreme Court.

99The principal question considered by the Supreme Court was whether the manner in which the evidence was obtained: 

""... violated the accused's right to the principles of fundamental justice"". 

The particular principle of fundamental justice under consideration was the right of a detained person to silence. McLachlin J (with whose reasons six other members of the Court agreed) held that the scope of that right must be based on the fundamental right of suspects to choose whether to speak to the authorities or to remain silent. That choice had to be a ""meaningful"" one; rejection of such evidence was permissible where it had been obtained unfairly in circumstances that violated that right of a choice.

100In the circumstances of that case, McLachlin J held that the accused's rights had been violated and the evidence ought not to be admitted. 

101It was in the course of providing the rationale for that conclusion that McLachlin J developed the concept of ""eliciting behaviour"". In that respect, she said:

""133 ... a distinction must be made between the use of undercover agents to observe the suspect, and the use of undercover agents to actively elicit information in violation of the suspect's choice to remain silent. When the police use subterfuge to interrogate an accused after he has advised them that he does not wish to speak to them, they are improperly eliciting information that they were unable to obtain by respecting the suspect's constitutional right to silence: the suspect's rights are breached because he has been deprived of his choice. However, in the absence of eliciting behaviour on the part of the police, there is no violation of the accused's right to choose whether or not to speak to the police. If the suspect speaks, it is by his or her own choice, and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform the police."" 

102A similar issue arose a year later in Broyles. The accused, a 16 year old, was charged with the murder of his grandmother. At the time of the charge the evidence against him was circumstantial. Several days prior to the accused being charged with murder, he was charged with fraud offences. He asked to call a lawyer, but appears to have been unsuccessful in making contact with one. He was then cautioned by a police officer and questioned. The evidence of the police officer was that at that time the accused was not a suspect in a homicide. Later, he was a suspect, but police had insufficient evidence to charge him.

103Police recruited a friend of the accused to visit him while in custody. The friend was fitted with a listening device. The accused did not admit to killing his grandmother, but made a damaging statement, to the effect that he had known that his grandmother was dead from a time when she was missing and before her body was found. 

104The evidence was admitted in the trial and the accused was convicted. He appealed to the Supreme Court. The judgment of the Supreme Court was delivered by Iacobucci J. Iacobucci J referred to Hebert, and said:

""25 It is clear from Hebert that the right to silence is triggered when the accused is subjected to the coercive powers of the state through his or her detention. The question of what right to silence, if any, remains after a detainee is released is a question not raised by the facts of this case.""

105It was then that the notion of ""state agent"" appeared. Iacobucci J went on to say:

""27 It is clear from Hebert, supra, that the purpose of the right to silence is to prevent the use of state power to subvert the right of an accused to choose whether or not to speak to the authorities. Where the informer who allegedly acted to subvert the right to silence of the accused is not obviously a state agent, the analysis will necessarily focus not only on the relationship between the informer and the accused, but also on the relationship between the informer and the state. The right to silence will only be infringed where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement, and where the informer was acting as an agent of the state at the time the accused made the statement. Accordingly, two distinct inquiries are required. First, as a threshold question, was the evidence obtained by an agent of the state? Second, was the evidence elicited? Only if the answer to both questions is in the affirmative will there be a violation of the right to silence in s 7.

(a) The Threshold Question

28 In every case where the right to silence is raised, the threshold question will be: was the person who allegedly subverted the right to silence an agent of the state? In answering this question one should remember that the purpose of the right to silence is to limit the use of the coercive power of the state to force an individual to incriminate himself or herself; it is not to prevent individuals from incriminating themselves per se. Accordingly, if the person to whom the impugned remarks is made is not an agent of the state, there will be no violation of the right to silence."" (italics added)

Iacobucci J went on to consider what constituted the recipient of confessional material ""an agent of the state"". He said:

""29 In some cases, it will be clear that the person to whom the statements were made was an agent of the state. For example, if the statements were made to a police officer or to a prison official, whether in uniform or in plainclothes, there could be no question that the statements were made to an agent of the state. In other cases, it will be less clear. Where the statements are made to an informer, as in the case at bar, it may be arguable whether or not the coercive power of the state was brought to bear on the suspect in obtaining the statement from him or her.

In determining whether or not the informer is a state agent, it is appropriate to focus on the effect of the relationship between the informer and the authorities on the particular exchange or contact with the accused. A relationship between the informer and the state is relevant for the purposes of s 7 only if it affects the circumstances surrounding the making of the impugned statement ... Only if the relationship between the informer and the state is such that the exchange between the informer and the accused is materially different from what it would have been had there been no such relationship should the informer be considered a state agent for the purposes of the exchange. I would accordingly adopt the following simple test: would the exchange between the accused and the informer have taken place, in the form and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or its agents?"" (italics added)

106He then went on to consider the concept of ""elicitation"" which he found difficult precisely to define, but identified a number of factors that influence the determination. He concluded the relevant question to be:

""37 ... considering all the circumstances of the exchange between the accused and the state agent, is there a causal link between the conduct of the state agent and the making of the statement by the accused?"" (italics added)

107He then isolated two groups of relevant factors. The first, he held:

""38 ... concerns the nature of the exchange between the accused and the state agent. Did the state agent actively seek out information such that the exchange could be characterized as akin to an interrogation, or did he or she conduct his or her part of the conversation as someone in the role the accused believed the informer to be playing would ordinarily have done? The focus should not be on the form of the conversation, but rather on whether the relevant parts of the conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation."" (italics added)

The second set of factors, he held:

""39 ... concerns the nature of the relationship between the state agent and the accused. Did the state agent exploit any special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement? Was there a relationship of trust between the state agent and the accused? Was the accused obligated or vulnerable to the state agent? Did the state agent manipulate the accused to bring about a mental state in which the accused was more likely to talk?"" (italics added)

Iacobucci J also considered that evidence of the instructions given to the state agent for the conduct of the conversation may be important.

108Taking into account all of those factors, Iacobucci J concluded that the friend was acting as a state agent, and did elicit the statements from the accused such that statements made by him were made in violation of his rights under s 7 of the Charter to choose to remain silent.

109As I have noted above, the Canadian cases are important because they were both referred to, with apparent approval, by various members of the High Court in Swaffield and Pavic. I shall state the facts in each of those cases as briefly as possible. Swaffield was a case under the Queensland Criminal Code. Swaffield was suspected of various offences, of which the most serious was arson. He declined to be interviewed. He was charged, but no evidence was offered and he was discharged. He remained a suspect. An undercover operation took place during which an undercover police officer engaged him in conversation. During the course of that conversation Swaffield made admissions of his involvement in the fire which had given rise to the charge of arson. 

110On his trial, the evidence was admitted, and Swaffield was convicted. The Court of Appeal (Qld) allowed the appeal and ordered an acquittal. The Crown appealed to the High Court. 

111Pavic was a Victorian case. Pavic was suspected of murder. He was taken into custody for questioning but declined to answer questions. He was released.

112Police then took a statement from a close friend of Pavic, which they considered provided them with enough evidence to charge him. They suggested that the friend, on behalf of police, speak with Pavic, while carrying a recording device. The friend did so and Pavic made admissions. The evidence was admitted, it played a substantial part in the Crown case, and Pavic was convicted. The appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed. Pavic further appealed to the High Court.

113In a joint judgment, Toohey, Gaudron and Gummow JJ noted that, historically, the approach of Australian courts had not been, as was the case in the Canadian cases, to address the issues by reference to the informed choice of the suspected person to speak. However, their Honours added:

""91 ... it is no great step to recognise, as the Canadian Supreme Court has done, an approach which looks to the accused's freedom to choose to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned. Where the freedom has been impugned the court has a discretion to reject the evidence. In deciding whether to exercise that discretion, which is a discretion to exclude not to admit, the court will look at all the circumstances. Those circumstances may point to unfairness to the accused if the confession is admitted. There may be no unfairness involved but the court may consider that, having regard to the means by which the confession was elicited, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable having regard to prevailing community standards. This invests a broad discretion in the court but it does not prevent the development of rules to meet particular situations.""

They then said:

""97 What if a test is applied by reference to Swaffield's right to choose whether or not to speak to the police? The application of such a test turns, at least so far as the Canadian authorities are concerned, on the extent to which any admission was elicited. It is clear from Hebert that the Canadian Supreme Court regards the use of a subterfuge to obtain a statement as likely to be in violation of the choice whether or not to speak but even then would treat a quite unelicited admission as not calling for the exercise of the discretion to exclude.""

114Their Honours held, as did Brennan CJ in a separate judgment, that Swaffield's admissions were elicited by the undercover police officer in clear breach of his right to choose whether or not to speak. They accordingly dismissed the Crown's appeal.

115Although the principles in relation to Pavic were not different, the result was - the evidence against Pavic was held to be admissible, and his appeal was dismissed.

116Kirby J, who dissented in the result with respect to Pavic, also adopted the approach taken by the Canadian Supreme Court (para [155]). He said:

""155 The test propounded is consistent with the general approach which our law has taken towards deception by law enforcement officials. Subterfuge, ruses and tricks may be lawfully employed by police, acting in the public interest ... There is nothing improper in these tactics where they are lawfully deployed in the endeavour to investigate crime so as to bring the guilty to justice. Nor is there anything wrong in the use of technology, such as telephonic interception and listening devices although this will commonly require statutory authority ... The critical question is not whether the accused has been tricked and secretly recorded. It is not even whether the trick has resulted in self-incrimination, electronically preserved to do great damage to the accused at the trial. It is whether the trick may be thought to involve such unfairness to the accused or otherwise to be so contrary to public policy that a court should exercise its discretion to exclude the evidence notwithstanding its high probative value. In the case of covertly obtained confessions, the line of forbidden conduct will be crossed if the confession may be said to have been elicited by police (or by a person acting as an agent of the police) in unfair derogation of the suspect's right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent. Or it will be crossed where police have exploited any special characteristics of the relationship between the suspect and their agent so as to extract a statement which would not otherwise have been made."" (italics added)

117Pavitt was another case in which allegations of sexual offences were made, and in which, at the instigation of police, the complainant telephoned the offender for the specific purpose of engaging him in conversation in which it was hoped that he would make admissions. The conversation was, as in the present case, recorded pursuant to a warrant issued under the Surveillance Devices Act. McColl JA and Latham J, in a joint judgment, examined and analysed in detail the relevant authorities.

118Their Honours, after extensive consideration, reduced the relevant propositions to nine, which they set out as follows:

""70 ...

(a) The underlying consideration in the admissibility of covertly recorded conversations is to look at the accused's freedom to choose to speak to the police and the extent to which that freedom has been impugned ...

(b) If that freedom is impugned, the court has a discretion to reject the evidence, the exercise of which will turn on all the circumstances which may point to unfairness to the accused if the confession is admitted ...

(c) Even if there is no unfairness the court may consider that, having regard to the means by which the confession was elicited, the evidence has been obtained at a price which is unacceptable having regard to prevailing community standards ... 

(d) The question whether the conversation was recorded in circumstances such that it might be characterised as either unfair and/or improper include whether the accused had previously indicated that he/she refused to speak to the police;

(e) The right to silence will only be infringed where it was the informer who caused the accused to make the statement, and where the informer was acting as an agent of the state at the time the accused made the statement. Accordingly, two distinct inquiries are required: 

(i) as a threshold question, was the evidence obtained by an agent of the state?

(ii) was the evidence elicited?

(f) A person is a state agent if the exchange between the accused and the informer would not have taken place, in the form and manner in which it did take place, but for the intervention of the state or its agents ...

(g) Absent eliciting behaviour on the part of the police, there is no violation of the accused's right to choose whether or not to speak to the police. If the suspect speaks, it is by his or her own choice, and he or she must be taken to have accepted the risk that the recipient may inform the police ... 

(h) Admissions will have been elicited if the relevant parts of the conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation and if the state agent exploited any special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement; evidence of the instructions given to the state agent for the conduct of the conversation may also be important ...

(i) The fact that the conversation was covertly recorded is not, of itself, unfair or improper, at least where the recording was lawful."" (internal citations omitted)

These were the propositions to which Graham ADCJ referred in the closing paragraph of the extract from his judgment above. McColl JA and Latham J went on to say:

""71 We would add that views may differ about whether a complainant is a state agent, even if the conversation is recorded in circumstances facilitated by the police ... For our part we would not readily apply the label of state agent to a complainant speaking to a suspect who had not been charged, nor refused to speak to police. Rather we would look at the whole relationship as revealed by the participants' past history and what is revealed by the actual conversation. It may be relevant to consider whether the police scripted the conversation."" (internal citation omitted)

119At [72] their Honours considered that conversations in such circumstances were more likely to be reliable as the suspect would have no occasion to boast or to ""big note him or herself"", and would be more likely to reject any false proposition put.

120While recognising that the conversation would ""most probably"" not have been recorded without the intervention of police, their Honours rejected the proposition that the complainant in that case was an agent of the State and went on to hold that, even if he were, he did not exploit any special characteristics of his relationship with the appellant. They did not consider that the conversation would, absent the intervention of police, have been materially different, noting that the appellant exhibited no unease in participating in the conversation and was relaxed throughout and was in a position to terminate the conversation at any time. There was no inequality in the conversation. They noted that, if anything, it was the complainant who appeared vulnerable, being in an increasingly emotional state during the conversation.

121They further rejected the notion that the conversation was ""the functional equivalent of an interrogation"", saying that the complainant had clearly formulated ideas of what he wanted to say to the appellant, and that the evidence did not support the proposition that police had scripted the complainant's part in the conversation. 

122They concluded that the appellant had made the admissions voluntarily in circumstances which did not cast doubt upon their reliability. They concluded that the circumstances in which the conversation took place were not such as to lead to the conclusion that its admission into evidence, or a conviction obtained in reliance upon it, was bought at a price that was unacceptable having regard to contemporary community standards.

123The conclusions of their Honours are, of course, specific to the facts of the case that was before them. It is for this Court to apply the principles set out in paragraph 70 to the facts of the present case. However, the facts in Pavitt bore a close resemblance to the present case with the exception that in Pavitt the telephone conversation was very lengthy and contained more damaging admissions than the conversation in the present case. The decision in Pavitt is a useful guide in the application of the principles stated.

124Like McColl JA and Latham J in Pavitt, I am satisfied that, in the present case, the complainant was not ""an agent of the State"", and it was erroneous so to categorise her. The evidence of Detective Egan-Hurst was that he believed that there would, in any event, have been contact between the complainant and the respondent and that a conversation concerning the events of 18 May would have taken place. Given their personal and professional relationship, this was a correct assessment. It was inevitable that the respondent would reply to the complainant as he did in the telephone call. He had already communicated with her, by text message, to similar effect.

125The exchange was therefore not materially different from what it would have been had there been no intervention by police (see Broyles, para 30). The intervention of the police did not bring about the respondent's admissions: their intervention was limited to the timing of the conversation, and the fact that it was recorded, so that it could be used for evidentiary purposes.

126Applying the test stated in the last sentence of paragraph 30 of Broyles (would the exchange have taken place in the form and manner it did, but for the intervention of the state or its agent?), the complainant was not an agent of the state. 

127Nor could it be said that the admission was ""elicited"". Again, applying the tests proposed in Broyles (paragraphs 37-40) the apology initially made by the respondent in the telephone conversation was made in response to the complainant's inquiry about why he had been attempting to contact her. At that stage, it could not be said that the complainant ""actively [sought] out information such that the exchange could be characterised as an interrogation"". Even the second apology in the conversation was made in response to the complainant pressing the respondent to explain why he had done what she asserts that he did. What that assertion was, was never spelled out. In no way could that be called ""the functional equivalent of an interrogation"".

128I am satisfied that the circumstances of the conversation did not amount to an unfair derogation of the respondent's right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent, and the finding that it was was erroneous. The respondent was able to terminate the conversation at any time. The complainant did not, prior to the respondent's first apology, make any direct or indirect accusations. She opened the conversation by asking the respondent why it was that he had been attempting to contact her. It was the respondent who introduced the subject of the events of the early morning of 18 May and apologised for them. It is also relevant to note that the apology he made in the conversation echoed the apology he had, in a completely unsolicited fashion, earlier made by text message. 

129It was also erroneous to hold that the police were exploiting some special characteristic of the relationship between the respondent and the complainant. There was no relationship of trust (in the sense that that expression was used in paragraph 39 of Broyles) between the complainant and the respondent. The respondent was not obligated or vulnerable to the complainant; and the complainant did not manipulate the respondent to bring about a mental state in which he was more likely to talk. 

130It was incorrect also to say that, while the conversation was not ""scripted"", the ""key question"" was conveyed to the complainant so that she was, in effect, asking what the police themselves would have wished to ask. All that Detective Egan-Hurst did was to suggest to the complainant a possible opening gambit, or introduction. That did not touch on the alleged offence at all - it was to ask why the respondent had been attempting to contact her.

131The evidence of Detective Egan-Hurst and the complainant shows that they had different understandings about the purpose of the call. Detective Egan-Hurst understood clearly that its purpose was to ""capture"" evidence in a permanent and objective form. The complainant understood that the purpose of the call was for her to obtain an explanation for the respondent's conduct.

132If the respondent's responses to the complainant are construed as admissions (as they are capable of being construed), they were not, within the meaning of s 90 of the Evidence Act, made in circumstances that rendered it unfair to use them in evidence. I am satisfied that the evidence ought not to have been excluded under s 90 of the Evidence Act. 

Section 137

133Section 137 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms:

""137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant."" 

134The section requires two separate assessments and a judgment: first, an assessment of the probative value of the evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown, second, an assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant (that might be caused by its admission), and, finally, a judgment as to whether any such danger outweighs the probative value of the evidence. If the result of the assessment process is that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant, the court is obliged to exclude the evidence. There is a danger of unfair prejudice if there is a real risk that the jury will make improper use of the evidence: R v BD (1997) 94 A Crim R 131.

135The probative value that the Crown sought to assign to the evidence of the telephone conversation is to be found in the two distinct passages in which the respondent apologised to the complainant. The first of these was made in response to the complainant's query about why the respondent had been attempting to contact her by text messages, and was otherwise unprompted by anything she said. It amounted to a clear apology, a suggestion of misunderstanding on his part, and a wish to put the episode in the past. The second followed her asking what ""compelled you to do something like that"", accusing him of breaking her trust, denying that she had given ""signals"", reminding him of her prior rejection of his advances, and, finally, saying ""... I don't know what part of no you don't get"". It again amounted to a clear apology; even more importantly, it contained heavy overtones of admissions of sexual contact (""Your leg, my arm, your leg against my arm""); most importantly, it contained an acknowledgment that the complainant had been asleep at the time.

136In the District Court, the Crown's position was that these were unequivocal acknowledgments of criminal wrongdoing. If that were accepted, then it can hardly be gainsaid that the probative value of the evidence is high.

137However, the position adopted on behalf of the respondent was that his answers to the complainant were not so clear cut, and were capable of a different interpretation, or, as it was put, ""competing inferences"", and that this diminished the probative value of the evidence (counsel did not specify what the ""competing inferences"" were).

138In considering the probative value of the evidence, the judge said:

""However, there is a real possibility that there is an alternative explanation, inconsistent with the guilt of the [respondent], which, in my view, significantly affects the probative value of the material. That is, of course, even assuming that what was said does amount to an admission. I am prepared to accept, for the purpose of this ruling, that there is sufficient material to give rise to an available inference of the type I have outlined but, if that is the case, then there is, in my view, a real possibility of an alternative explanation ... that is, an alternative inference inconsistent with the prosecution case and objectively plausible ...

In considering the alternative explanation which may be available here, it is not, of course, the task of this court to determine which is the more probable or correct inference to be drawn, that contended for by the Crown or the alternative inference available in the context of this case. What is relevant is the availability or presence of an inference which is a competing inference ... 

The alternative explanation is that what was said by the [respondent] is equally consistent with, or is at least plausibly consistent with, the [respondent] expressing a sense of guilt at having become involved in a consensual encounter in the aftermath of an evening of drinking and socialising, despite the relationship with the complainant previously having been one in which the complainant had drawn a line between their professional and social relationship, on the one hand, and any intimate relationship on the other. That possibility is enhanced (a) by the context of the conversations which had been had in the past between the complainant and the [respondent], referred to in her statement, (b) by the terms of the text message which had been sent on 30 May and, indeed, (c) what was said by the complainant at the bottom of page 2 of the transcript when, inter alia, she said 'I warned you before you know you were one of my closest friends'. That is an assertion which is consistent with the complainant's own statement that she had rejected any sexual advances on the part of the [respondent] and had insisted that they remain on friendly terms rather than on more intimate terms. If he had been 'warned' before, then that is an obvious explanation of the content of the warning.

The competing inferences, in other words, relate, on the one hand, to the possibility that the conduct of the [respondent] was criminal in the sense (in this instance) that there was a lack of consent or a knowledge of lack of consent, on the one hand, or of an acknowledgement of social or moral guilt, on the other. As adults, the conduct which is the subject of the charge here was not of itself illegal but obviously would be if the requirements of the criminal the law were met. However, even if not illegal, the conduct may have been regarded by one or both of the parties as unwise or as a source of subsequent regret on one or both sides. After all, there had been an apparently good working relationship and the conversation is at least plausibly consistent with disappointment that there had been some sexual encounter, which may have been perhaps a reluctant one but not necessarily one to which the complainant was not consenting or was one in which the [respondent] believed that she was consenting or had some grounds for believing that the encounter was consensual. After all, this was an event which occurred after a long night of celebration and where the parties had been socialising and drinking so that an apology, and even the accusation which was levelled about the breach of trust, would be consistent also with a consensual, but unwise and subsequently regretted, encounter between the [respondent] and the complainant.

In those circumstances, assuming that the material is otherwise admissible, for example assuming that what was said could amount to an admission of the type outlined by the Crown, the material is, in my view, almost intractably incapable of being dissected to determine whether the admissions could be reliably acted upon as admissions of criminality or aspects of criminality, on the one hand, or simply as admissions of moral or social impropriety, which could not be relevant to proof of the charge here. If the latter is an available inference, as I consider it is, then, while not falling into the same category as the situation of a person whose alternative explanation might involve admissions as a predilection for sexual encounters with high school teenagers, nonetheless there is a significant prejudicial effect where the alternative explanation itself reveals that there has been what could properly be regarded by the jury as, perhaps, the [respondent] taking advantage of a person with whom he was in a friendly and working relationship, to persuade that person to have a sexual encounter with him. That, in itself, would be prejudice of an unfair type. In other words, the application of s 137 of the Evidence Act would lead to a conclusion that the probative value of the alleged admissions here is weak, principally by reason of the existence of a plausible alternative explanation, whereas there is a significant danger of unfair prejudice to the [respondent]. While it is true that aspects of that explanation can be left to the jury with directions seeking to dispel any risk of that prejudice affecting the jury's deliberations, in my view there would be no direction which would be sufficient to dispel the risk that the jury might conflate the two types of guilt - criminal and moral guilt - and attribute to that conversation more weight than it would properly carry where the inferences are relatively finally balanced, the competing inference being a strong available and plausible alternative explanation for what was said in the course of the conversation."" (italics added)

139What his Honour found, in that passage, reduced to its basics, was:


the words spoken by the respondent in the conversation were capable of being construed as admissions or acknowledgments that he had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent (that is, of criminal misconduct);


the words spoken by the respondent in the conversation were also capable of being construed as admissions or acknowledgments of some lesser form of sexual or moral impropriety, not amounting to criminal misconduct, but nevertheless blameworthy;


the availability of competing inferences to be drawn from the words spoken by the respondent significantly diminished the probative value of the evidence;


the fact that the alternative explanation of ""moral or social impropriety"" created a significant risk of unfair prejudice, in that the jury would be likely to ""conflate"" criminal and moral guilt, and attribute to the conversation more weight than it could properly carry;


since the probative value of the evidence was weak (by reason of the availability of the competing inferences) it was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. 

140During the course of the passage extracted above, Graham ADCJ referred to, and purported to apply, the reasoning in R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121 (with particular reference to the judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J), and DSJ v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth); NS v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] NSWCCA 9; 215 A Crim R 349. It will be necessary to return to consider the principles for which these cases (and others) stand.

141From the extract above from the judgment, it can be seen that the essential reason for the rejection of the evidence was that his Honour perceived some significant ambiguity in what the respondent was recorded as saying. The ambiguity he perceived lay in the respondent's responses to the complainant - were they to be construed as admissions of guilt of criminal conduct, or could they properly be construed as acceptance of some kind of moral wrongdoing falling short of criminality? (This, no doubt, was the ""competing inference"" to which counsel somewhat obliquely referred.) The Crown contended for the former construction. His Honour considered that the possibility of an alternative explanation, that the respondent's apologies were prompted by a sense of non-criminal wrongdoing, was ""enhanced"" by (i) the evidence of the complainant's previous rejection of the respondent's advances; (ii) the terms of the respondent's text message (another apology) of 30 May; and (iii) that part of the conversation in which the complainant told the respondent that she had warned him before, and that he had been one of her closest friends.

142This, in his Honour's view, affected the probative value of the evidence, rendering it ""weak"". He perceived the potential prejudice to the respondent as lying in the competing explanation itself - in that, even though the competing explanation was not of criminal conduct, it was, nevertheless, of conduct that the jury might see as discreditable. He considered that, of itself, to be prejudice of an unfair type. 

The competing positions of the parties on appeal

143I will encapsulate the positions of the parties briefly. On behalf of the Crown it was argued that:


his Honour erred in his assessment of the probative value of the evidence by taking into account (and treating as determinative) the fact that there existed ""an alternative explanation"" for the admissions;


that the alternative explanation proposed by his Honour was simply not available on the evidence, and the three factors said to ""enhance"" the likelihood of the benign explanation did not do so;


that his Honour erred in concluding that the alternative explanation itself constituted unfair prejudice.

On behalf of the respondent it was contended that:


the findings were clearly open on the evidence;


his Honour did not treat the mere existence of an alternative construction of the apologies as determinative;


that, his Honour having concluded that the probative value of the evidence was weak, the further conclusion that it was outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the competing inference was also open to him.

Analysis

144Section 137 does not arise for consideration unless and until the evidence in question has been judged to be relevant. That is because, as mentioned above, s 56(2) provides that evidence that is not relevant is not admissible. Section 56(2) is absolute, allowing for no exceptions. By s 56(1), evidence that is relevant is admissible. Unlike s 56(2), s 56(1) is subject to exceptions specified elsewhere in the Evidence Act.

145Section 55 explains what is meant by ""evidence that is relevant"". It is: 

""... evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.""

Thus, before consideration is given to any of the exceptions recognised by s 56(1), the evidence has been held (or admitted) to have the capacity rationally to affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. 

146""Probative value"" is defined in the Dictionary as meaning: 

""the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.""

The exercise required by s 56(1) is a qualitative one: does the evidence have the quality of being capable of rationally affecting the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue? The exercise required in assessing probative value is a quantitative one: to what extent does the evidence have that quality?

147Section 137 may therefore properly be read as:

""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecution if the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.""

148A necessary first step in the assessment of the probative value of evidence is to identify any ""fact in issue"" the assessment of the probability of the existence of which is said to be affected by the evidence. The ultimate facts in issue in a criminal trial are the facts that constitute the elements of the offence charged. Often there will also be issues about facts relevant to those facts: Smith v The Queen [2001] HCA 50; 206 CLR 650 at [7]. The elements of an offence against s 61I of the Crimes Act are:


that the accused had sexual intercourse (in the manner alleged) with the complainant;


that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse;


that the accused knew that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse.

In a criminal proceeding, ""fact in issue"" is not necessarily to be equated with ""fact in dispute"". That is because, even if the accused person does not dispute the facts that support one or more of the elements of the offence, the obligation remains on the Crown to prove each element beyond reasonable doubt. Moreover, an accused person is not bound by any pre-trial pleadings. Accordingly, in this case, the Crown was obliged to prove each of the three elements that constitute an offence against s 61I. They are therefore facts in issue.

149The only assessment of probative value made by the judge in this case was that it was ""weak"" or ""extremely weak"". He reached that conclusion on the basis of what he perceived to be the existence of a ""plausible alternative explanation"" for what the respondent said. A little earlier, he had said that, in the light of the alternative explanation, the admissions made by the respondent ""could not be relevant to proof of the charge here"".

150What is absent from the assessment is any identification of the ""fact[s] in issue"" the probability of the existence of which was said to be affected by the evidence. The elements of the offence - that is, the ultimate facts in issue - for the purpose of this trial are set out above. The respondent's apologies are strongly suggestive of an acknowledgement that he had had sexual intercourse with the complainant. The evidence could therefore rationally affect the probability of the existence of the first of the ultimate facts in issue. It is not to the point that, by indicating, through his counsel, that the (disputed) issue in the trial would be consent, the respondent had impliedly admitted that sexual intercourse had occurred. First, as set out above, an accused is not bound by pre-trial pleadings. Second, also as mentioned above, whether the facts that support an element of an offence are or are not disputed, the obligation remains on the Crown to prove each element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. The respondent's acknowledgments - even if given the benign alternative interpretation - amounted to evidence strongly probative of the first element.

151The probative value of the evidence does not end there. The second element that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is the absence of consent by the complainant. This is the element, the judge was told, that would be most strongly in issue. Section 61HA(4)(b) of the Crimes Act expressly provides that a person does not consent to intercourse if he or she does not have the opportunity to do so because he or she is asleep. That last part of the respondent's conversation with the complainant in which he acknowledged that she might have been asleep goes powerfully to the question of consent. 

152Perhaps less powerfully, but still relevantly, that part of the conversation also goes to the third element, the respondent's knowledge that the complainant was not consenting to the intercourse.

153For these reasons alone, even if it were legitimate to take into account the existence of the alternative explanation for the respondent's apologies, the approach to the assessment of the probative value of the evidence was flawed, as was the assessment of its probative value as weak.

154More problematic is the reliance by his Honour on the existence of an ""alternative explanation"" or a ""competing inference"" in the assessment of the probative value of the evidence.

155I have no difficulty, in this case, in accepting that the words used by the respondent in response to the complainant are susceptible of the interpretation for which the Crown contends. For the purposes of this appeal, I am prepared to accept that the respondent's words are susceptible of an alternative, more benign, interpretation which falls short of an acknowledgement of wrongdoing that is criminal in character.

156I do have difficulty with the logic of the proposition that the existence of an alternative interpretation robs the evidence of the respondent's words of probative value, or diminishes its probative value. The probative value of evidence depends upon what the tribunal of fact draws from the evidence. If the jury accept the Crown interpretation, the probative value of the evidence will (as a matter of fact and reality) be high. 

157A number of provisions in the Evidence Act (s 97, s 98, s 101, s 103, s 135, s 137 and s 138) make the admissibility of evidence dependent upon an assessment, by the trial judge, of the probative value of the evidence. Two things may be said about the actual probative value to be assigned to any item of evidence. The first is that the actual probative value to be assigned to the evidence is in the province of the tribunal of fact - in most criminal trials, the jury. The second is that the actual probative value cannot be determined until all of the evidence in the trial is complete. By way of example, evidence of a positive identification of an accused person as the perpetrator of a crime may appear to have powerful probative value when it is admitted. Its actual probative value may diminish, even to the point of extinction, in the light of other evidence, whether given in cross-examination, or by other witnesses.

158The provisions which make admissibility of evidence dependent upon an assessment of its probative value are not, and cannot be, concerned, with the actual probative value of the evidence; they must be concerned with the potential probative value of the evidence on completion of the trial, as assessed by the trial judge at the time the admission of the evidence in question - what Spigelman CJ in Shamouil called the ""capability"" of the evidence to affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the fact in issue.

159The actual probative value of any item of evidence will often be determined by reference to the credibility or reliability of the witness through whom it is given. That is the simple case. In other cases, the actual probative value of the evidence may depend on what interpretation is placed upon it - or what inferences are drawn from it. The present is such a case. As I have noted above, there is no issue that the respondent spoke the words recorded. As I have also noted above, I accept that his answers to the complainant may legitimately be interpreted by the jury as unequivocal admissions of sexual intercourse with the complainant, in circumstances where she was asleep and therefore not in a position to consent. I also accept, for the purposes of the present ground of appeal, that those answers may be interpreted as an acknowledgement of sexual intercourse with the complainant, notwithstanding that she had, on previous occasions, given a clear rejection of the respondent's advances, but in circumstances that rendered the respondent's conduct morally, but not criminally, blameworthy. The assessment of the potential probative value of the evidence must disregard the more benign interpretation and focus on the interpretation most favourable to the party tendering the evidence. That alternative interpretation is, in my opinion, for the purpose of assessing the potential probative value of the evidence, irrelevant. What the court is concerned with at the stage of determining admissibility is its potential probative value.

160Where an item of evidence is capable of different interpretations, or is susceptible of ""competing inferences"", its actual probative value will depend upon what interpretation is placed on it, or what inferences are actually drawn from it. It is no part of the judge's function to make that assessment. The function of the judge is to assess the extent to which the evidence has the capacity to bear upon the proof of the fact or facts in issue. This was the approach taken by James J, with whom Rothman and Harrison JJ agreed, in R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142; his Honour said:

""38 It not infrequently happens that evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown in a criminal trial is open to more than one interpretation or is capable of giving rise to more than one inference. However, provided that the evidence is capable of bearing the interpretation or of giving rise to the interference (scil - inference) contended for by the Crown, the fact that the defence can suggest some other interpretation or inference which would be consistent with the innocence of the accused does not, of itself, show that any probative value the evidence has is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

39 It is part of the function of the jury as the judges of the facts to determine what interpretation should be given to evidence they accept and to determine what inferences should be drawn from evidence they accept. It is frequently part of the function of the jury to determine which, if any, of a number of competing inferences should be drawn.""

161Obviously, in determining the admissibility of evidence by reference to probative value, a trial judge is making the assessment on the basis of the information available at the time the question of admissibility is under consideration. In R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 and R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 I described the process as an exercise that is ""predictive and evaluative"". The predictive element is not a prediction of what the jury will make of that item of evidence on completion of the evidence in the trial; it is a prediction of the potential value of the evidence when the mosaic of evidence is complete.

162The exercise necessarily requires that the assessment of probative value, in that sense, be made on the basis that the evidence will be accepted as reliable and credible - that is, at its most favourable for the tendering party, or, as has been said, ""at its highest"" (for example, Shamouil at [87]). That is in accordance with a long line of authority.

163The correct approach to the assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 137 has been the subject of much judicial consideration. Debate has centred around whether, and if so, to what extent, a judge is entitled (or bound), in assessing probative value, to take into account the credibility, reliability or weight of the evidence in question. There are many statements, in a variety of contexts, to the effect that reliability, credibility, and weight are not relevant to that assessment.

164R v Carusi (1997) 92 A Crim R 52 was decided under the rules of evidence pre-dating the Evidence Act. Under the common law a trial judge had a discretion (contrasted with an obligation under s 137) to exclude evidence the probative value of which was outweighed by its prejudicial effect: R v Christie [1914] AC 545. The discretion came to be known as ""the Christie discretion"". Apart from the transformation of a discretion into an obligation, s 137 transplants that principle into statute. In Carusi, Hunt CJ at CL, with whom Newman and Ireland JJ agreed, said:

""It was for the jury, and not for the trial judge, to determine the factual issues at the trial ... The power of the trial judge to exclude evidence in accordance with the Christie discretion does not permit the judge, in assessing what its probative value is, to determine whether the jury should or should not accept the evidence of the witness upon which the Crown case depends. The trial judge can only exclude the evidence of such a witness where, taken at its highest, its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect; whereas this Court may use its supervisory powers to set aside a verdict where, the issue having been left to the jury, this Court is satisfied - on the whole of the evidence - that the jury ought nevertheless have had a reasonable doubt.""

165In R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52 the evidence under consideration was evidence that the appellant, who was charged with an offence of threatening to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon with intent to have sexual intercourse, had fled when he saw police arriving. The evidence was tendered as evidence demonstrating a consciousness of guilt. The appellant could only explain his flight by exposing his guilt of other offences of a not dissimilar kind and he gave evidence of the reasons for his flight on a voir dire. The trial judge admitted the evidence of flight tendered by the prosecution. In doing so, he made findings of fact, adverse to the appellant, about the explanation provided by him on the voir dire.

166With the concurrence of Ipp JA and Adams J, I said:

""43 ... I am satisfied that it is not the role of a trial judge in NSW, under the Evidence Act, to make a finding of fact about the actual reasons for flight where such evidence is given on behalf of the Crown. That remains the province of the jury. The role of the judge in NSW, at least post-1995, is merely to determine the relative probative value against the danger of unfair prejudice that might result. In saying this, I do not mean to lay down a blanket rule that, in considering evidence on a voir dire in which the issue is the admissibility of evidence having regard to s 137, there is never any room for findings concerning credibility. There will be occasions when an assessment of the credibility of the evidence will be inextricably entwined with the balancing process. That means that particular caution must be exercised to ensure that the balancing exercise is not confused with the assessment of credibility, a task committed to the jury ...""

Those remarks were not directed to the assessment of the probative value of the prosecution's evidence, which I had earlier (at [36]) found to be ""very high indeed"", but to the manner in which the trial judge had approached the explanation for his conduct given by the accused on the voir dire.

167That formulation was adopted in R v Singh-Bal (1997) 92 A Crim R 397 at 403 and R v Yates [2002] NSWCCA 520 at [255]-[256].

168Spigelman CJ, in Shamouil, took up the issue, in an appeal brought by the Crown under s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Procedure Act. The Chief Justice reviewed the authorities, including Cook, and said:

""64 To adopt any other approach would be to usurp for a trial judge critical aspects of the traditional role of a jury. In the case of evidence of critical significance, such a ruling by a trial judge would, in substance, be equivalent to directing a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the trial judge was of the view that a verdict of guilty would be unsafe and unsatisfactory. As the High Court said in that different, but not irrelevant, context in Doney v The Queen [[1990] HCA 51;] 171 CLR 207 at 215, this is not a permissible 'basis for enlarging the powers of a trial judge at the expense of the traditional jury function'. In my opinion, the same is true if a trial judge can determine the weight of evidence when applying s 137.""

169In R v Suman Sood [2007] NSWCCA 214, Latham J, with the concurrence of Ipp JA and Fullerton J, said:

""40 Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the respondent, it was no part of the trial judge's function in assessing probative value under s 137 to have regard to competing explanations for the respondent's conduct, other than that upon which the Crown relied, even assuming that an alternative explanation was given by the respondent on the voir dire."" 

170Thus, the position in NSW historically has been that in the assessment of probative value, a trial judge does not take into account questions of credibility, reliability, or weight of the evidence. It must be taken, for the purpose of that assessment, that the evidence will be accepted by the jury as reliable. It is, however, necessary to be clear about the context in which these statements have been made.

171If it remains the case that that is the correct approach, then it was an error for the trial judge to take into account the existence of an alternative explanation, or a competing inference.

172In Carusi the evidence in question was evidence of identification of the accused from a photo array by a witness. It was not in issue that the identification had been made; the issue was the reliability of the identification, having regard to well recognised dangers inherent in identification evidence.

173In Cook the evidence in question was the accused's account of the reasons for his flight from police. It was not, he said, consciousness of guilt of the offence charged - it was consciousness of guilt of other offences. The trial judge allowed the prosecution evidence to be given, because he disbelieved the evidence given by the accused. (The appeal was allowed and a new trial ordered.) 

174In Shamouil, the evidence was also identification evidence. The alleged victim of the offence had positively identified the accused, but later retracted the identification. The issue was the admission of evidence of the initial identification. As in Carusi, it was not in dispute that the alleged victim had made the identification. The challenge to the evidence was under s 137 - that danger of unfair prejudice caused by the evidence outweighed its probative value. The trial judge ruled that the evidence would be excluded. In doing so, he took into account ""the general unreliability of identification evidence"", and what he perceived as deficiencies in the credibility of the victim. This was held to be erroneous.

175In Sood, the evidence in question was evidence of concealment of documents relevant to a police search in a fraud investigation. There was no issue that the documents had been found in waste bins. The issue was what inferences could be drawn from that evidence.

176The position in Victoria is now different. In Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 328; 218 A Crim R 507 (at [63]), the Victorian Court of Appeal held that the decision in Shamouil was ""manifestly wrong"" (and that the decisions that preceded it, to similar effect, were also ""manifestly wrong""). That Court held that:

""In order to determine the capacity of the evidence rationally to affect the determination of a fact in issue, the judge is required to make some assessment of the weight that the jury could, acting reasonably, give to that evidence."" 

That prompted this Court to reconsider its position, which it did by a bench consisting of five judges, Basten JA, Hoeben CJ at CL, and Blanch and Price JJ and myself: R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121, to which I will come.

177A different approach to the assessment of probative value has been taken, in a different context, by this Court, constituted by five judges: DSJ v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth); NS v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2012] NSWCCA 9; 215 A Crim R 349. DSJ was a case in which the evidentiary issue concerned evidence tendered as coincidence evidence under s 98 of the Evidence Act. Section 98 is of general application, to both civil and criminal trials. Section 101 adds further considerations and constraints in relation to coincidence evidence tendered in criminal trials. It is important to note that the decision in DSJ concerned s 98, and not s 101.

178Section 98 requires the exclusion of evidence tendered as coincidence evidence unless (reasonable notice having been given): 

""... the court thinks that the evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value.""

In that context, Whealy JA said:

""78 In this appeal the Crown has conceded that, in performing the task under s 98, a trial Judge may, in an appropriate case, have regard to an alternative explanation arising on the evidence. The Crown, however, insisted that, in so doing, the trial judge is restricted to examining whether the Crown hypothesis has cogency, that is, whether the Crown evidence is capable of being regarded as significant in its ability to prove the Crown case. If the coincidence evidence, either by itself or having regard to other evidence in the Crown case, positively and forcefully suggested an explanation consistent with innocence, then the coincidence evidence could scarcely be regarded as important or of consequence in proving the fact or facts in issue. What is required is this: the trial judge must ask whether the possibility of such an alternative explanation substantially alters his (or her) view as to the significant capacity of the Crown evidence, if accepted, to establish the fact in issue. Does the alternative possibility, in the judge's view, rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity to prove the Crown's case? If it does not, the trial judge may safely conclude that the evidence has significant probative value.

79 In a practical sense, there are two avenues of approach to be taken. First, in examining the coincidence evidence (together with other material already in evidence or to be adduced) the trial judge is required to ask whether there emerges, from a consideration of all the Crown evidence, a possible explanation inconsistent with guilt. For regard to be had to the alternative explanation, it must be a real possibility, not a fanciful one. It must be a broad or overarching possibility, capable of being stated in general terms, even though it may derive from an individual piece or pieces of evidence or the evidence taken as a whole.

80 Secondly, the trial judge must ask whether that possibility substantially alters his (or her) view as to the otherwise significant capacity of the coincidence evidence to establish the fact or facts in issue. Of course, if the trial judge has already concluded that the coincidence evidence does not reach that level of significance in terms of its capacity, he will have rejected the evidence in terms of s 98. In that situation, the possibility of an alternative inference may, for the time being, be set to one side. Later in the trial, when the evidence has concluded, that possibility will become a matter for the jury to assess and determine when it comes to consider whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.

81 The Crown, in making its concession, however, stressed that at no stage in this process was the trial Judge required or entitled to assess the actual weight of any part of the evidence, or to make any actual assessment concerning the probabilities of any alternative theory. Nor was the trial judge required or entitled to make a comparison of the Crown theory and the probabilities of any alternative theory. This proposition appears consistent with established authority. Any attempt by the trial judge to anticipate the actual weight the jury would attach to the evidence is prohibited, as I have explained.""

179These paragraphs were expressly endorsed by the Chief Justice. In doing so, the Chief Justice said:

""10 However, as Whealy JA has pointed out (at [78]-[81]), the trial judge in forming a view as to whether the evidence has significant probative value must consider by reference to the evidence itself or other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party tendering it, whether there is a real possibility of an alternate explanation inconsistent with (in this case) the guilt of the party against whom it is tendered. This is because the availability of such an alternative hypothesis will be relevant to forming the view required by the section that the evidence has significant probative value. However, this does not involve either undertaking the fact-finding analysis suggested by senior counsel for DSJ or reaching a conclusion that the explanation for the coincidence proffered by the party seeking to tender the evidence was more probable than an alternative hypothesis. Each of these approaches go beyond what is required by the terms of s 98(1)(b) of the [Evidence] Act and would involve the judge usurping the fact-finding role of the jury.""

Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL and McCallum J all agreed with the reasons of Whealy JA.

180Although it may be that DSJ is not, strictly speaking, binding on this Court as presently constituted, it would be an extraordinary step to depart from the pronouncements of a five judge bench which included the three most senior members of the Court. For the purposes of determining the admission of evidence tendered as coincidence evidence, DSJ states the law for NSW.

181It does not necessarily follow that the identical approach must be taken with respect to contentious evidence where objection is taken under s 137. The two provisions have some marked differences.

182As I have said above, the s 137 exercise consists of three steps. The first is the quantitative assessment of the probative value of the evidence. The second is the assessment of the danger of unfair prejudice. The third is the judgment whether the latter outweighs the former. It is a balancing exercise.

183The exercise required by s 98 is different. Section 98, like s 137, does not arise for consideration unless the evidence has been determined to be relevant. Section 98 calls upon the court to consider, not whether the evidence has the capacity rationally to effect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue - that having already been determined - but to take the evidence, in conjunction with other evidence already adduced or to be adduced by the tendering party, and, in the light of all that evidence, to measure the significance of the (potential) probative value. It is in this respect that a possible alternative explanation becomes relevant. It is of significance that in para [78] Whealy JA referred to an alternative explanation ""arising on the evidence"". A possible ""alternative explanation arising on the evidence"" within s 98 is not the same as ""a competing inference"" to be drawn from the very evidence the admissibility of which is in question. Under s 98, the court looks at the whole of the case of the tendering party (so far as it is known) in order to assess the significance of the challenged evidence. Section 98 does not require the balancing of the (potential) probative value of the evidence as so measured against any other consideration. (In criminal proceedings, such a measure is required by s 101, but that is not presently material.)

184Accordingly, I am of the view that the manner in which this Court approached the assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 98 does not compel a similar approach in relation to s 137. 

R v XY [2012] NSWCCA 121

185In XY, two members of a five judge bench (Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J) applied the reasoning in DSJ to the assessment of probative value for the purposes of s 137.

186XY was a case that had significant parallels with the present. Allegations of sexual misconduct with a child of 8 years of age were made against XY. Nine years later, at the instigation of police, the complainant made a telephone call to XY. (In fact, two telephone calls, in quick succession, were made; that was because the first call disconnected.) The objective of the telephone calls was for the complainant to engage XY in conversation in the hope that he would make relevant admissions or say something incriminating. The telephone calls were recorded pursuant to a warrant issued under the Surveillance Devices Act.

187XY responded to the complainant, but in terms that, more so than in the present case, were equivocal. It was possible to interpret what he said as an acknowledgment of some sort of sexual activity with the complainant. There was also ample room for a different interpretation, one that did not involve admissions or acknowledgments of sexual wrongdoing with the complainant, but left open the possibility of an acknowledgment of sexual activity with a girl of high school age at a different time. There was room for doubt that XY was aware of the identity of the caller.

188As in the present case, objection was taken to the admission of the recording of the conversation under both s 90 and s 137 (and other provisions it is not necessary here to mention). What follows is concerned with the Court's approach to s 137. 

189The judgments in XY give little comfort to any seeking resolution of the conflict in the NSW authorities, represented by Shamouil, and the Victorian decision in Dupas. Although, at [65], Basten JA said:

""... there is no compelling reason to depart from the general approach accepted in Shamouil""

that was because, in his Honour's view, the differences between the two approaches were more apparent than real. At [72], his Honour expressed the view that ""no real risk of unfair prejudice arose""; this was largely because any adverse inferences that might be drawn from the alternative explanation could be readily eliminated by directions, upon which juries are presumed to act (see R v Lansdell (NSWCCA, 22 May 1995, unreported)). There was, therefore, in the view of Basten JA, ""no occasion to assess the 'probative value' of the evidence"". At [66], Basten JA said:

""The importance of Shamouil lies not in the precise language used (the judgment is not to be treated as a statute) but in the general principle it articulates. The operation of that principle may vary depending upon the circumstances of the case. In broad terms, the principle has three elements: 

(1) in determining inadmissibility under s 137, the judge should assess the evidence proffered by the prosecution on the basis of its capacity to advance the prosecution case;

(2) it follows from (1) that the judge should deal with the evidence on the basis of any inference or direct support for a fact in issue which would be available to a reasonable jury considering the proffered evidence, without speculating as to whether the jury would in fact accept the evidence and give it particular weight;

(3) it also follows from (1) that the judge should not make his or her own findings as to whether or not to accept the inference or give the evidence particular weight.""

At [67] Basten JA set out the alternative inferences available in that case, and, at [68], he held that determining which inferences should be accepted was ""quintessentially"" a function for the jury.

190Hoeben CJ at CL (at [86]) expressly adopted the views of Basten JA contained in [66]-[67], and agreed that, in assessing the probative value of prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, the Court should not consider issues of credibility, reliability or weight. However, Hoeben CJ at CL went on to say:

""88 ... When assessing the probative value of the prosecution evidence sought to be excluded, ie, its capacity to support the prosecution case, a court can take into account the fact of competing inferences which might be available on the evidence, as distinct from determining which inference or inferences should be or are most likely to be preferred ...""

191Blanch J also considered the existence of competing inferences to be relevant to the probative value of the evidence, although he added that such competing inferences must amount to a ""real possibility"" or be such as to ""rob the evidence of its otherwise cogent capacity"" ([204]). At [207] he held that:

""... the capacity of the evidence to prove guilt is compromised because of the competing inferences open when interpreting the conversations ...""

192Price J preferred the conclusions of the Victorian Court of Appeal in Dupas: [224]. 

193For my part, I adhered to the views I had previously expressed and considered that Shamouil represents the law in NSW. 

194Accordingly, by a majority (Basten JA, Hoeben CJ at CL and myself, Blanch J not expressly deciding, Price J contra) the Court decided that trial judges in NSW should continue to disregard questions of credibility, reliability and weight in dealing with the admission of evidence challenged under s 137. However, Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J further considered that the existence of ""competing inferences"" (or alternative interpretations) was relevant to the assessment of probative value.

195It was by reason of the existence of such ""competing inferences"" or ""alternative explanations"" that Graham ADCJ determined that the evidence ought to be excluded. This was a direct reference to the judgments of Hoeben CJ at CL and Blanch J. Whether that is correct is central to the resolution of this ground of appeal. 

196I am unable to accept that the existence of ""competing inferences"" available to be drawn from (or alternative interpretations of) the proposed prosecution evidence has any part to play in the assessment of probative value for the purpose of s 137 of the Evidence Act. That is because of the different exercise required by (for example) s 98, and s 137. Section 98 requires an assessment of the significance of the probative value of the evidence tendered as coincidence evidence in the context of the whole of the case of the tendering party. That is why, in DSJ, it was held that the existence of alternative explanations could have a bearing on the significance of the probative value of the evidence.

197Section 137 requires assessment of the probative value of the evidence without regard to other evidence in the Crown case (s 137 applies only to evidence tendered by the prosecution) but balanced against the danger of any unfair prejudice.

198In my opinion, the decision to exclude the evidence based on s 137 of the Evidence Act resulted from an incorrect approach to the task required by the section. The starting point of the assessment is to assume that the inferences most favourable to the Crown will be drawn, and to assess the potential probative value on that basis, without regard to the availability of any competing inference.

199The only potential unfair prejudice to the respondent identified by the judge was the possible ""conflation"" of an explanation for his conduct that, while not criminal, might be seen as discreditable with the explanation proposed by the Crown. The judge effectively discarded any possibility that directions to the jury could and would ameliorate any such prejudice. That, in my opinion, was an incorrect approach. The criminal justice system proceeds on the foundation that juries can and do abide by the directions they are given (Lansdell).

200The probative value of the evidence, which was significant in the respects I have outlined above, was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.

201The evidence should not have been excluded under s 137.

Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 5F(3A)

202I have concluded that the Director has made good his challenge to each of the rulings on evidence the subject of his Notice of Appeal. That is not the end of the matter. As indicated in the opening paragraphs of these reasons, pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act, in order to succeed on the appeal, it is necessary that the Director establish that either or both of those rulings ""substantially weakens the prosecution's case"". 

203If each, individually, has that quality, the issues raised by Nguyen do not arise for consideration. Similarly, if either, but not the other, has that quality, the issues raised by Nguyen do not arise for consideration. It is only if the conclusion is that either, taken alone, fails to reach that threshold, but, in combination with the other, would do so, that the correctness of Nguyen needs to be considered.

The telephone conversation

204It will be convenient to start with the evidence of the telephone conversation.

205Absent the evidence of what the respondent said in the conversation, the Crown case depends almost entirely upon the evidence of the complainant. I have set out above the manner in which the respondent's answers to the complainant in the conversation may be interpreted as admissions or acknowledgments of each of the elements necessary for the Crown case. Where a Crown case depends upon the otherwise uncorroborated evidence of a single witness, corroborative evidence may substantially enhance that case.

206In such cases, it has been customary for judges to direct juries that evidence of the single witness must be ""scrutinised with great care"" before it can found a conviction: R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12 at 19; and see XY at [127]-[131].

207It is true that s 294AA of the Criminal Procedure Act prohibits the giving of any warning to a jury of the danger of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of any complainant. That such a warning is not given by the judge does not mean that a jury would not take the view that, in the absence of some external evidence tending to enhance or corroborate the complainant's evidence, the heavy onus of proof imposed on the Crown had not been discharged.

208Thus, the evidence of what the respondent said to the complainant in the conversation, if interpreted as contended on behalf of the Crown it should be, is important and potentially weighty evidence in the Crown case. Its absence from the trial would substantially weaken the Crown case.

209Accordingly, there is jurisdiction in this Court to entertain the Crown appeal with respect to that ruling.

210In those circumstances, in respect of the first decision the subject of the Crown appeal, I would allow the appeal and set aside the ruling.

The sexual history evidence: s 293 Criminal Procedure Act 

211A far more complex question arises in relation to the evidence that comes within s 293(4)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Act.

212As mentioned above, the issue with which the trial judge dealt was an application by the respondent's legal representatives to cross-examine the complainant with respect to her general sexual availability. It may be assumed that, that leave having been given, it might extend to allowing Mr McManus to give evidence of his observations of the complainant's sexual interest in the stranger in the bar, with a view to laying a basis for a submission to the jury that the complainant, being prepared to agree to consensual sexual activity with one man, would also agree to consensual sexual activity with the respondent.

213The present question is whether the admission of evidence of that nature ""substantially weakens the prosecution's case"".

214Section 5F(3A) is not, as might at first be thought, limited to evidence tendered by the prosecution. If that had been the intention of the legislature, it could readily have framed the sub-section in that way. It may be equally damaging to the prosecution case erroneously to admit defence evidence, whether by cross-examination or through witnesses. There is no reason that such a ruling should or would not come within sub-s (3A), although, to the best of my knowledge, that has not previously been the subject of decision of this Court.

215Does the admission of evidence of the complainant's sexual interest in a man other than the respondent ""substantially weaken the prosecution's case""?

216After considerable hesitation, I have concluded that it does. Admission of that evidence would deflect the jury from a proper consideration of the true issues in the trial. It would permit a false issue to be raised - the inference proposed to be advanced that, because the complainant showed a sexual interest in the stranger, she would equally have been sexually interested in the respondent. By distracting the jury from its proper task, and raising a false issue, admission of the evidence would substantially weaken the prosecution case.

217I would therefore allow the appeal on this basis.

218The orders I propose are:

(i) Crown appeal allowed;

(ii) The ruling that evidence of the telephone conversation between the complainant and the respondent on 12 June 2012 be excluded is vacated;

(iii) The ruling that evidence of the complainant's prior sexual experience be admitted pursuant to s 293(4) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is vacated.

219R A HULME J: I agree with Simpson J.

220BARR AJ: I agree with Simpson J.

		07 January 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705659,R v Kennedy [2013] NSWSC 1940,"Judgment1On 30 July 2013 Adam John Kennedy (""the offender"") pleaded guilty to the murder, on 3 May 2012, of Debara Martin (""the deceased"").  The offender's trial had been listed to commence on 12 August 2013. 
2I heard evidence and submissions from the parties on 12, 13 and 17 December 2013.  
THE APPLICABLE MAXIMUM PENALTY3The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is one of life imprisonment (see Crimes Act 1900 NSW S. 19A).  A standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed for that offence pursuant to s. 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (""the Sentencing Act"").
4Section 61(1) of the Sentencing Act mandates the imposition of a life sentence for murder if I am satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of such a sentence.  The Crown has not sought the imposition of a life sentence in the present case, and I am satisfied that such a sentence is not appropriate.
5In determining the appropriate sentence, I am not required to assess whether, having regard to the standard non-parole period, the offence is in the middle range of objective seriousness, nor am I required to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120 at [25]).  The relevant statutory provisions contained in the Sentencing Act require an approach to sentencing in which all of the relevant factors are identified.  Having identified those factors, I must then reach a determination as to the appropriate sentence (see Muldrock (supra) at [26] citing Markarian v R (2005) 228 CLR 357).
6The standard non-parole period for the offence of murder requires that content be given to its specification as the non-parole period for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness.  It represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, without regard to the range of factors, both aggravating and mitigating, that bear relevantly on sentencing in an individual case (see Muldrock (supra) at [27] and [31]).
VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENTS7Victim impact statements were read to the court by: 
(i)Ann Martin, the deceased's mother; and 
(ii)Josephine Martin, the deceased's sister.
8A further victim impact statement was read to the court on behalf of the deceased's father, Roger Martin.
9Once again, I take this opportunity of expressing the court's sympathy to the members of the deceased's family.  It is to be hoped that the opportunity that each of them has been given to provide a statement to the court will assist their process of grieving in respect of the loss of their daughter and sister.  The authorities make clear the approach which is to be taken by a sentencing judge in relation to statements of that kind in a case such as the present (see for example R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76).

THE FACTS10The Crown tendered a statement of facts which, but for two issues arising from the medical evidence, were agreed.  I have dealt with those issues separately below.
11The deceased was 43 years old at the time of her death and lived with the applicant in Toormina, in northern New South Wales.  At the time of her death she had recently commenced work as a kitchen hand at a café in Coffs Harbour. She had previously worked as a sex worker and the offender had been one of her clients. 
12The deceased and the offender commenced a relationship in 2011.   That relationship was marked by volatility.  One particular source of argument appears to have been the deceased's decision to return to being a sex worker.  The deceased had complained to a number of friends and colleagues that the offender had been physically violent toward her in the months leading up to her death. In particular, she had complained that the offender had held a knife to her throat when he was drunk at the end of March 2012.  Shortly before her death, she had complained that the offender had hit her, and she was observed at that time to have a black eye and a swollen face.  Although she was encouraged to report the incident to the police, she did not to do so. 
13At about 11.30pm on 3 May 2012 the offender arrived at the home of his brother, Luke Kennedy, at Tewinga, a location approximately 38 km south of Toormina.  Prior to the offender's arrival, his brother had gone to bed.  Having woken to the sound of knocking and screaming, the offender's brother got out of bed and heard the offender saying:
""I've killed her ....I finally killed"".
14The offender's brother noted that the offender appeared to be heavily intoxicated, having seen him previously in that state.  He noticed that the offender was stumbling, and on a scale of 1 to 10 he formed the view that the offender was at level 10, or perhaps even 11.  
15The offender asked his brother to assist him in disposing of the deceased's body.  This request was refused, and the offender left the house.   
16Brendan Ware, a friend of the offender and his brother, was also staying at the house at Tewinga at that time.  He had been sleeping in a bedroom towards the rear of the house when the offender arrived.  Mr Ware heard a car approaching the house.  He initially stayed in bed but having heard yelling and screaming, he got up and went to the living room where he saw the offender.  Mr Ware described the offender as yelling and screaming, ""off his ..... head"", and saying things about killing or hurting someone in ""drunken rampage mumbles"".  According to Mr. Ware, the offender was known to make violent and intemperate statements when he was intoxicated, although Mr Ware stated that he had never seen the offender as drunk as he was on this occasion.  He thought that on a scale of 1 to 10 the offender was at 11.  
17The offender's behaviour caused Mr Ware to leave the house and hide in a nearby paddock.  It was not until he heard a car leave the area several hours later that he decided to return.  As he approached the inside of the house he saw a person's leg hanging over the sofa. He then ran away again and went to a friend's house. 
18Subsequently, the offender's brother saw the deceased lying on the sofa. He noticed blood dripping from her head, injuries to her face and a white substance that he thought was moisturiser on her head.  That same substance had been squirted around the house.  The offender's brother formed the view that the deceased was dead at that time.
19The offender's brother then collected some clothing and left the premises. As he left he noticed items of clothing on the ground near where he had seen the offender and the car earlier that night.  He drove to the Macksville Police Station at around 3.00am where he reported the incident. 
20Upon arrival at the premises at Tewinga, police found the deceased's body lying across the sofa. She was wearing underpants, a short black skirt, a pink bra, a singlet type top which had been pushed up revealing her stomach, and ankle length socks. She was not wearing shoes. A baseball bat was found underneath her body.
21The left side of the deceased's face was heavily bruised and swollen, and blood was draining from her mouth and nose. Her hair was blood soaked and a denture plate was tangled in her hair. She had blood on both hands, both arms, both feet and her right thigh.
22Drops of a white cream substance were on the deceased's face.  An empty 375ml tube of ""Palmolive Naturals Conditioner"" was resting near the deceased's left ear.  There was an oval pattern of white cream on the floor and another oval pattern of white cream on the bottom sheet of the bed located in the bedroom used by the offender's brother.  
23At about 2.25 am on the morning of 4 May 2012 police observed a vehicle being driven by the offender travelling at an excessive speed in a southerly direction along the Pacific Highway near Taree.  Police had earlier received reports of a similar vehicle swerving all over the road. When the police stopped the offender, he fled on foot.  He was pursued and apprehended.  Police observed that the offender's breath smelt strongly of alcohol, his speech was slurred, he was unsteady and he was only partially dressed.  
24The offender was taken to Taree police station and subjected to a breath analysis.  He told police he commenced drinking at a hotel at 12 pm on the previous day and had not consumed any food.  On analysis, the offender's blood alcohol concentration was 0.150 g/100ml.   There is pharmacological evidence, based partly on the offender's account of the amount of alcohol he had consumed, which establishes that the offender's blood alcohol concentration at 9.00 pm on the evening of 3 May 2012 would have been 0.239, and that it would have been 0.224 at 10.00 pm. 
25At the home shared by the offender and the deceased, police observed the following:   
a clear oily residue had been sprayed over the internal side of the front door;an empty Coca Cola bottle and an empty water bottle were found on the kitchen bench. The caps of the bottles were on the floor in the living room;the kitchen floor was wet and soil was scattered over the floor;there were numerous shoe impressions on the kitchen floor, all of one shoe type; handwriting and scribble in blue marker pen were on the front of the refrigerator door;a symbol which appeared to have been written in tomato sauce was on the inside of the refrigerator; soil and shoe impressions similar to those in the kitchen were located in the bathroom;a potted plant and soil had been tipped into and around the bowl of the vanity;a tube of toothpaste was also in the bowl and had been used to write the letters ""BW"" and ""AK"" on the vanity;the words ""On Dave"" appeared to have been written in purple soap on the sliding doors of the vanity;a pot containing soil was in the toilet bowl along with a can of air freshener. 
26The offender participated in an electronically recorded interview with police on 14 June 2012.  He told police that in the two to three week period leading up to the deceased's death he had been drinking every day and that on 3 May 2012 he had spent most of the day drinking whilst the deceased was at work.  He said that at about 5.00pm the deceased had arrived at the hotel looking for him, and that a short time after he returned to the premises at Toormina.  Upon arrival, the offender saw that his belongings had been packed up and were out the front of the house.
27According to the offender, the deceased had told him to ""get out"" and had complained about the fact that he had been supposed to take her out for dinner that night. The offender and the deceased argued, the deceased being upset about the offender's drinking, before things calmed down and the deceased agreed to let the offender stay.  
28The offender told police that the deceased decided to have a sleep, at which time he went and purchased a bottle of rum. He returned to the house and was having a drink when the deceased woke up. The deceased then started shouting at the offender and ordered him from the house saying:  
""Get out of the house before I fucking stab you""
29According to the offender, an altercation ensued in which the deceased squeezed his testicles, and in which he became fearful that the deceased was going to get a knife to stab him.  He asserted that it was in the course of this altercation that he commenced to hit the deceased.  He told police that having done so, he began to panic and then telephoned his father, telling him that he had done something ""really really stupid"".  According to the offender, he had decided to take the deceased to the hospital but he said that as he approached the turn off to the hospital, he became overwhelmed by the prospect of being arrested.  This appears to have stemmed from the fact that there were outstanding warrants for his arrest in relation to other offences, which he believed might result in his immediate incarceration.  He told police that he decided instead to drive to his brother's house, some 38km away, so that his brother could phone an ambulance.  It should be noted that there is no evidence to suggest that the offender asked his brother to call an ambulance, or that an ambulance was otherwise called.
30Both parties made submissions to me regarding the offender's account to police.  The Crown urged me to reject the offender's assertion that he was assaulted by the deceased by her grabbing his testicles and further submitted that I would reject the offender's assertion that he was fearful of the possibility that the deceased was intending to obtain a knife and inflict injury with it.  It was made clear on behalf of the offender that any previous suggestion of self defence was abandoned.  However, it was submitted that the opinion of Professor Lyons, which I have referred to further below, supported at least some aspects of the offender's account.
31The offender did not give evidence before me, and his account is therefore untested.  Although I am satisfied that there was some altercation between the offender and the deceased, the evidence is insufficient to enable me to reach any further conclusion about what occurred in the course of that altercation.  
The evidence of Professor Lyons and Professor Hilton32Professor Lyons conducted an autopsy of the deceased on 6 May 2012 and his report forms part of the material tendered by the Crown.  In terms of the deceased's injuries, Professor Lyons found:
(i)injuries to the ear, eye, and mouth; 
(ii)evidence of traumatic brain injury;
(iii)two injury patterns to the neck, namely an area of bruising and a patterned abrasion;
(iv)a fracture of the greater horn of the hyoid bone;
(v)multiple bruising to the arms and legs, and to a lesser extent the torso, all of which were of a fingerprint bruise type;
(vi)a pattern of bruising on the back of both hands, suggestive of a defence pattern of injuries;
(vii)fractures of the right 6th and 7th ribs, immediately adjacent to the sternum; 
(viii)bruising to the membrane connecting the small intestine to the abdominal cavity around the duodenum, suggestive of moderate to blunt force trauma to the abdomen; and 
(ix)bruising to the left breast, the top of the right foot and the outer left lower leg.  
33Initially, Professor Lyons thought that the injuries inflicted to the deceased's head region were most likely caused by an instrument such as the baseball bat found underneath the deceased's body, and were the result of at least three applications of such force.  He also thought that the deceased's death was caused by the combined effects of head injury and neck compression.   In response to these opinions, two reports of Professor Hilton were tendered in the case for the offender.  Whilst Professor Hilton stated that he was ""in substantial agreement"" with the opinions expressed by Professor Lyons, his reports raised two issues, namely:  
(i)whether an implement such as a baseball bat was used to inflict one or more of the injuries; and
(ii)whether, having inflicted injury to the deceased at their home, the offender inflicted further injury upon the deceased after that time and in particular, at or about the time that he arrived at his brother's premises.    
34It was initially proposed that both experts would be called to give oral evidence as to these issues but as events transpired this was not possible.  Arrangements were then made for the two experts to confer, which resulted in a further report from Professor Lyons being tendered by the Crown.  Professor Lyons stated that such report had been prepared with the ""substantial agreement"" of Professor Hilton, before expressing the following further opinions:  
(i)no baseball bat or similar implement was used in the assault upon the deceased;
(ii)the injuries to the face, head, neck, hyoid bone and ribs were generally consistent with having been caused by vigorous blows from one or both fists;
(iii)the abdominal injury was caused by a form of blunt force trauma, which could have resulted from simply the weight of the offender in moving himself into a position in which he was sitting on the deceased;
(iv)the bruises to the left thigh were unlikely to have been caused by the use of an implement and were consistent with being caused by a fist;
(v)the complex pattern of injuries was such that it was not possible to describe one particular event as the terminal event.
35Professor Lyons did make reference to the fact that some of the injuries could have been ""caused by a weapon in the sense of a shoe in stamping"".  However, both parties agreed that this was necessarily speculative and that I should proceed on what were, in effect, the joint opinions set out in [34](i) to (v) above.  
36Bearing all of these matters in mind, I am satisfied that the deceased's injuries, and her resultant death, were caused by multiple blows struck by the offender with his fists.
The offender's intention37The Crown submitted that there were a number of factors which supported a conclusion that the offender had acted with an intention to kill the deceased.  Those factors were said to include:
(i)the severity of the assault upon the deceased;
(ii)the statement made by the offender to his brother to the effect that he had ""finally killed"" the deceased; and
(iii)the request made by the offender to his brother for assistance in disposing of the deceased's body.  
38However, the Crown expressly acknowledged that it remained open to me to find that the offender acted with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm as opposed to an intention to kill.  In circumstances where the Crown bears the onus of satisfying me, beyond reasonable doubt, of any finding of fact against the offender, I am not satisfied that the offender acted with an intention to kill the deceased.  I have reached that conclusion for a number of reasons.
39Firstly, whilst the injuries sustained by the deceased were both significant and widespread, caution must be exercised in drawing an inference of intention from such evidence, particularly in circumstances where the offender was intoxicated (see Bellchambers v R [2008] NSWCCA 235 at [36] per Allsop P (as his Honour then was)).  
40Secondly, whilst I have had regard to the statements made by the offender to his brother, on the evidence before me the offender was still in an intoxicated state when those words were said.
41Finally, even if it is accepted that the offender was at one point intending to dispose of the deceased's body, and that he requested assistance from his brother in that regard, I do not consider that circumstance to be consistent only with an intention to kill the deceased.  It may, for example, have arisen as a result of the deceased being in a state of panic.   
42For all of these reasons, I find that in repeatedly punching the deceased, the offender acted with an intention to cause the deceased grievous bodily harm.  
The statutory aggravating factors43Two statutory aggravating factors were relied upon by the Crown, the first of which was that the offence was committed in the home of the deceased (see s. 21A(2)(eb) of the Sentencing Act).  Given that the premises in which the incident occurred were those of the both the offender and the deceased, it was submitted on the offender's behalf that s. 21A(2)(eb) had no application.    
44In R v Comert [2004] NSWCCA 125, a case of sexual assault committed by a husband upon his wife, the sentencing judge had concluded that the offending was aggravated by the fact that it had occurred in the victim's home.  Hidden and Hislop JJ said (at [29]):
""Reading the relevant part of the sentencing judge's remarks as a whole, there can be no doubt that her Honour did characterise, as an additional aggravating feature, the fact that the offence was committed in the complainant's home.  We are satisfied that, in so doing, her Honour fell into error.  No doubt, that would have been an aggravating feature if the offender had been an intruder.  However, we are unable to see how a sexual assault on a woman by her husband is rendered more serious because it was perpetrated in the matrimonial home.  This, of course, is not to deny the gravity of offences of violence, whether or not of a sexual nature, committed in a domestic setting"".
45That reasoning has been applied in several cases since that time (see for example EK v R [2010] NSWCCA 199; (2010) 79 NSWLR 740; Ingham v R  [2011] NSWCCA 88; R v BIP [2011] NSWCCA 224; DS v R [2012] NSWCCA 159; and Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11).     
46In Melbom v R [2013] NSWCCA 210 the applicant had been convicted of offences of reckless wounding and threatening to use an offensive weapon which had been committed in the home of the victims, who had previously invited the applicant to live with them.  R A Hulme J (with whom Simpson and Price JJ agreed) noted (at [44]) that the Crown had conceded the correctness of the earlier authorities cited in [45] above.  However his Honour appeared to express some doubt as to such correctness, observing (at [44]):
"" ..... the plain words of s. 21A(2)(eb) do not support the limitation that this Court has placed on their application. ..... It was never intended by Parliament that there should be the constraint upon their application that this Court has imposed"".  
47Simpson J (at [2]) shared the reservations expressed by R A Hulme J and thought that the time had arrived for a re-examination of those earlier decisions.  R A Hulme J ultimately concluded (at [51]) that the sentencing judge had not simply referred to the fact that the offending was aggravated by the fact that it occurred in the home occupied by the victims and the applicant.  His Honour added:
""Her approach would clearly have been contrary to authority if that was all that she had said"".
48More recently, in Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214, the Court of Criminal Appeal considered offences of aggravated sexual assault committed in the applicant's home in circumstances where the victim was an acquaintance of the applicant's girlfriend.  The sentencing judge had made reference to the place of the offending as an aggravating factor.  R A Hulme J (with whom Leeming JA and Button J agreed) having referred to the decisions cited in [45] above and the decision of Melbom, was not persuaded that the sentencing judge had erred in finding that the offending was aggravated by the fact that it had occurred in the applicant's home, because it was not that fact alone which had been taken into account (at [52]).  The additional factors which aggravated the offending included that:
(i)the victim was a guest;(ii)she had gone to bed with an 18 year old woman who had been her friend for six years;(iii)she had, as a result, an entitlement to a feeling of safety and security;(iv)unbeknown to her, the applicant had taken the place of her friend in the bed and had proceeded to sexually assault her.
49His Honour proceeded (at [53]) to draw a distinction between the facts in the case before him and those in Comert (an assault by a husband upon his wife in their home), EK (assaults by a father in the home in which he and the victim lived), Ingham (where the offender was a regular overnight visitor to the premises in which he sexually assaulted two complainants in his care) and BIP, DS and Essex (each of which concerned sexual assaults by men of children of their respective partners, committed in the home).   His Honour also concluded (at [55]) that even if the sentencing judge had erred in the manner for which the applicant contended, he had nevertheless been entitled to take into account the violation of the victim's expectation of safety and security as a factor which rendered the offending more serious. 
50The circumstances of the offending in Montero which led his Honour to reach his conclusions are quite different from the circumstances of the present offending, which are far closer to those considered in the earlier decisions to which his Honour referred.  Although doubts have been expressed about the correctness of those decisions, the occasion for reconsidering them has not yet arisen.  Accordingly, in the absence of any matter over and above the fact that the offending took place in the home occupied by the offender and the victim, I have reached the conclusion that s. 21A(2)(eb), on the present state of the authorities, has no application to the circumstances of the present case.
51The second statutory aggravating factor relied upon by the Crown arises from s. 21A(2)(j) of the Sentencing Act, namely that the offence was committed by the offender at a time when he was on conditional liberty.  There is no dispute that the offender was on bail for firearms offences at the relevant time.  I am satisfied that this aggravates the offending.  
Other aggravating factors52The Crown submitted that there were two other factors which aggravated the offending.  The first was the placing of cream to the face of the deceased which the Crown argued was a further act of aggression.  In the context of that submission, the Crown referred to the fact that the offender had done ""some bizarre things .... which remain unexplained"".   The placing of cream on the deceased certainly falls into the category to which the Crown referred but I am unable, without more, to categorise it as an act of aggression.
53The second matter was the request made by the offender, to his brother, for assistance in disposing of the deceased's body.  The general principle that the treatment of the body of a murder victim is capable of amounting to an aggravating factor has been extended to cases where such treatment does not involve any form of mutilation (see R v Goundar [2010] NSWSC 1170; R v Dong [2010] NSWSC 1242).  In the present case the offender's disposal of the deceased's body consisted of leaving the body at his brother's premises after his request for assistance was not met.  This aggravates the offending to some degree, although it must be recognised that such degree of aggravation is less than, for example, an instance in which a body is deposited in bushland (see Goundar).    
The offender's intoxication 54I have already made reference to the fact that the offender had been drinking heavily up to the time of the offending.  I am satisfied that he was grossly intoxicated when he killed the deceased.  The fact that the offender had been drinking heavily was not, on the evidence, out of the ordinary.  Significantly, he had been given the benefit of a bond under s. 9 of the Sentencing Act when sentenced in June 2008 for an offence of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence.  It was a condition of that bond that he obey all reasonable directions in relation to (inter alia) drug and alcohol rehabilitation.    The fact that the offender was intoxicated does not aggravate the offence, nor does it mitigate it.  I accept, as was submitted on behalf of the offender, that it may assist in providing an explanation for the offending (see Hasan v R [2010] VSCA 352; (2010) 31 VR 28; R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240).  
The objective seriousness of the offending 55The Crown submitted that I should find that the offending fell ""in the middle of the range of seriousness"" for offences of murder.  Counsel for the offender submitted that the offending should be regarded as ""less than mid range"".  The Court of Criminal Appeal has observed that a sentencing judge need not, and arguably should not, engage in the exercise of quantifying the distance between the offending before the court, and the conduct involved in a putative offence in the middle of the range (see PK v R [2012] NSWCCA 263 per McCallum J at [25] with whom Macfarlan JA and Price J agreed).  However, the assessment of objective seriousness of the offending nevertheless remains an important part of the sentencing process.
56Exactly what it was that motivated the offender to act in the manner in which he did remains unexplained.  Some of his actions were, as the Crown submitted, bizarre.  What is clear however, is that although there is no evidence to suggest that the offender's attack was pre-planned, it was nevertheless brutal and sustained.  It involved a high degree of violence with repeated use of the fists and resulted in a multitude of injuries being inflicted upon the deceased.  It follows that this was, on any view, an offence of significant objective seriousness.    
THE OFFENDER'S SUBJECTIVE CASEThe offender's background57The offender's father gave evidence before me.  A statement prepared by him was admitted without objection and he was cross-examined by the Crown.  The offender is now 26 years of age and was 24 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence.  His parents separated when he was 12, at which time he remained living with his mother although his father saw him regularly.  His father has since formed the view that the separation had a greater effect upon the offender than may have been appreciated at the time.
58The offender left school without completing Year 9 and was initially employed by his mother working in a nursery.  His mother then formed a new relationship and moved to Queensland.  The offender remained in NSW living what appears to have been a nomadic existence without a fixed address.  At the age of 19 he moved back to live with his father.  An attempt to attend TAFE for the purposes of obtaining his School Certificate was unsuccessful and he abandoned his studies.  He obtained employment as a process worker and later as a fork lift driver before problems emerged in relation to his being able to retain his employment.  This, it seems, was the first indication that the offender was drinking to excess.  He obtained an apprenticeship as a cabinet maker before returning to his previous job as a process worker but fell into a routine of spending the entirety of his wages on alcohol.  His difficulties with alcohol appear to have continued, largely unabated, since his late teens.
59The offender's father described the offender as ""beside himself"" and ""a visual and mental wreck"" when he first saw him following his arrest.  He also gave evidence of the remorse expressed by the offender to him on more than one occasion since that time.
Medical evidence60Tendered in the offender's case was a report of Anthony Diment, Consultant Psychologist, dated 3 December 2013.  The offender's history to Mr Diment as to his upbringing was generally consistent with the evidence of his father.  
61The history provided by the offender to Mr Diment also included an assertion that in his early 20s he had consulted a General Practitioner who ""thought he had psychiatric problems"" and who ""said (he) might have schizophrenia"".  The offender told Mr Diment that he felt ""bad"" about that suggestion and ceased attending the doctor.  No other medical evidence has been tendered to support these assertions.
62The offender also asserted that whilst in custody he had consulted a psychiatrist who ""said (he) had bipolar"" for which he was prescribed anti-depressant medication.  According to the offender, the side effects of that medication caused it to be replaced by a form of anti-convulsant medication which, according to Mr Diment, is also prescribed in cases of Bipolar Disorder.  No evidence from Justice Health was tendered in support of this history or treatment.
63Having conducted formal testing, Mr Diment concluded that the offender presented with DSM5 diagnostic criteria for the following:
(i)generalised anxiety disorder;(ii)panic disorder;(iii)persistent depressive disorder (moderate, chronic)(iv)substance-related and addictive disorder (alchohol/cannabis)
64Mr Diment also expressed the view that the offender exhibited criteria consistent with a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder.  He appears to have based this opinion, at least in part, upon the history provided to him by the offender and, in particular, upon the offender's assertion that he is currently taking prescribed medication which is used to treat that illness.  However, Mr Diment acknowledged that he would ""require further psychiatric/medical opinion"" in relation to this issue.    In circumstances where the offender's history to Mr Diment in respect of his medical history is not corroborated, and given the qualification expressed by Mr Diment, I am not satisfied that the offender suffers from Bipolar Disorder. 
65I accept Mr Diment's diagnoses of the conditions set out in [63] above.  Although it was not suggested that the offender's mental state was causally related to his commission of the offence, it was submitted on his behalf that the court should nevertheless have regard to such matters on sentence.  The Crown conceded that the offender's mental state was relevant in the overall assessment of his subjective case, but submitted that I would conclude that the source of the offender's current depression and anxiety was, in large measure, his present circumstances and, in particular, his incarceration.  In those circumstances, it was submitted that general deterrence remained an important consideration.
66Even where an offender's mental state is not causally connected to the commission of the relevant offence, it may remain the case that such condition renders the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence (see R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 per Allen J at 72).  However, that is not to say that evidence of a mental disability inevitably leads to the conclusion that general deterrence is of less significance.  In Engert (supra) Gleeson CJ said (at 68): 
""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the Court in the case of Veen (No 2). Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.
It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances. In every case, what is called for is the making of a discretionary decision in the light of the circumstances of the individual case, and in the light of the purposes to be served by the sentencing exercise"".

67The decision in Engert was referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v De La Rosa (2010) 79 NSWLR 1; [2010] NSWCCA 194 where his Honour (commencing at [177]) set out a number of principles relating to the sentencing of mentally ill offenders.  More recently, the decision in Engert was expressly applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Iskandar v R [2013] NSWCCA 235.  In that case, the Court determined that the sentencing judge had not erred in concluding that in the circumstances of that case general deterrence remained an important consideration notwithstanding the offender's mental illness.
68I am satisfied that general deterrence remains an important consideration in the present case, and that its importance is not lessened by the conditions diagnosed by Mr Diment.  There remains, in particular, a necessity to make it abundantly clear that the unprovoked perpetration of violence by persons who are grossly intoxicated has no place in the community.  That said, and although there is no evidence which would suggest that the offender's mental state renders his conditions of custody more onerous, I have taken that mental state into account in my overall assessment of his subjective case.  Mr Diment expressed the view that the offender's depression and anxiety (and, if it exists, his Bipolar condition) required treatment, and that the offender would benefit from programs designed to address issues of drug and alcohol abuse.  I have also taken these matters into account, along with the offender's reported expressions of willingness to undergo such treatment. 
The plea of guilty69The offender was first arraigned on 5 April 2013 at which time he entered a plea of not guilty.  The matter was then listed for trial commencing on 12 August 2013.  The matter came before the court again on 5 July 2013 at which time the trial date was confirmed.  There was no suggestion on that occasion that a plea of guilty might be entered.
70The matter first came before me on 23 July 2013 for the purposes of ascertaining (inter alia) the proposed length of the trial.  On that occasion, an indication was given that it was likely that the offender would plead guilty.  The matter was adjourned until 30 July 2013, at which time the plea of guilty was entered.  That was only two weeks prior to the proposed commencement of the trial.
71It was submitted on behalf of the offender that there had been indications prior to 23 July that the matter would not proceed to trial and that in these circumstances, the appropriate discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea was 20%.  The Crown's position was that what might be described as a vague indication of a plea was given shortly before the matter first came before me on 23 July.  However, the Crown pointed out that trial preparation continued until such time as the plea was entered on 30 July.  In these circumstances, the Crown submitted that the range of appropriate discount was between 12% and 15%.
72It is well established that the utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10% - 25% discount on sentence.  The primary consideration which determines where, within that range, a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea (see R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; [2000] NSWCCA 309 at 418, 419; [152], [154] and [160](iii) per Spigelman CJ).  A discount towards the bottom of the range is appropriate for late pleas unless there are particular benefits arising from the prospective length and complexity of the trial (Thomson at 418; [155]).  In circumstances where the offender's plea was entered virtually on the eve of an estimated three week trial, a suggested discount of 20% is, in my view, wholly inappropriate.  Bearing in mind that timing of the plea primarily determines where, within the range, a particular case falls, I take the view that the appropriate discount is one of 12.5%.     
Remorse73The actions of the offender in depositing the deceased's body at the home of his brother, after his request for assistance in disposing of the body was rejected, were not consistent with genuine remorse.  However, as I have noted, the offender's father gave evidence that from an early stage following his arrest, the offender expressed his remorse for the offending.  Those expressions have, according to the offender's father, continued.  I formed the view that the offender's father was a truthful witness and I have no reason to doubt his evidence.  I am satisfied that the applicant is remorseful and I take that into account as a mitigating factor.    
The offender's youth74The offender was aged 24 at the time of the offence.  It was submitted on his behalf that whilst he was ""not a child he nevertheless should be regarded as a youth and some allowance made in reduction of his sentence for the impulsiveness of his youth"".  I am unable to accept that submission.  Whilst an allowance can, in an appropriate case, be made for an offender's youth as opposed to just his or her biological age (see R v Hearne (2001) 124 A Crim R 451 at [25]) the offender in the present case was clearly an adult at the relevant time.  There is no evidence that immaturity, or for that matter impulsivity, played any part in his offending.  
The offender's criminal history75The offender has a criminal history dating back to 2005.  There are some offences of violence, and others which are obviously alcohol related.  In particular, and as previously noted, he was dealt with in 2008 on a charge of being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence and was given a bond under s. 9 of the Sentencing Act, which carried with it, in effect, a condition that he address his drug and alcohol addiction.  By virtue of his criminal history, the offender is not a person of prior good character and is not entitled to leniency on that basis.  
The offender's prospects of rehabilitation76As I have previously noted, Mr Diment thought that the offender required treatment to address his mental state, and thought that he would benefit from undertaking remedial programs.  He reported that the offender had expressed a willingness to undertake such treatment.  The offender's prospects of rehabilitation are necessarily dependent, at least in part, upon him successfully addressing his alcohol addiction.  Although he has expressed a willingness to undertake treatment, it is of concern that he has previously been given the benefit of a bond designed to address that very issue.  The commission of the present offence makes it clear that his efforts on that occasion fell short of what was required.  In these circumstances the offender's prospects of rehabilitation remain uncertain.  
The commencement date of the sentence77The offender was arrested on 4 May 2012 and was refused bail.  There were, at that time, warrants for his arrest in respect of other charges including escaping from lawful custody as well as firearms offences.  Following his arrest for the deceased's murder, he was sentenced in respect of those outstanding matters.  Those sentences expired on 3 December 2013.  In those circumstances, the Crown submitted that the sentence in respect of the present matter should commence on 4 December 2013.  It was submitted on behalf of the offender that if such a course were taken a finding of special circumstances should be made.
78In my view, there is no reason why the Crown's submission as to the starting date should not be accepted.  As to the submission made on behalf of the offender, circumstances which are not properly regarded as being ""special"" should not be elevated into that category (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704; [2001] NSWCCA 534 per Spigelman CJ at 719; [68]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [20]).  In order for special circumstances to be made out there must exist significant positive signs which show that if the offender is allowed a longer period on parole, rehabilitation is likely to be successful, and not merely a possibility (see R v Carter [2003] NSWCCA 243 at [20]).  I have already reached the conclusion that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are uncertain.  Accordingly, I do not find special circumstances.  The period in which the offender will be on parole will be significant in any event.  
79In sentencing the offender I have had regard to the provisions of s. 54B of the Sentencing Act as amended by Schedule 1[3] of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Non-parole Periods) Act NSW 2013 (""the Amendment Act"").  In particular:
(i)I have taken into account the applicable standard non-parole period as required by s. 54B(2); and
(ii)I have set out above my reasons for the sentence I propose to impose as required by s. 54B(3).
ORDERS80The offender is convicted.
81The offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 17 years and 6 months imprisonment, commencing on 4 December 2013 and ending on 3 June 2031, with an additional term of 5 years and 10 months imprisonment, commencing on 4 June 2031 and ending on 3 April 2037, a total sentence of 23 years and 4 months imprisonment.
82The offender will be eligible for parole on 4 June 2031.
83The total sentence will expire on 3 April 2037.

2705661,Marshall v Prescott (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1949,"Judgment
1On 31 May 2000 the late Neil Marshall was killed in an aircraft accident in the Spencer Gulf in South Australia.  At the time of his death Mr Marshall was in a de facto relationship with Ms Linda Carruthers.  However he was still legally married to the first plaintiff in these proceedings, Mrs Margaret Marshall.  They had one son, being the second plaintiff, Kim Marshall.  Mrs Marshall was the executrix of Mr Marshall's will.  She and her son were the only beneficiaries.
2Unfortunately Mr Marshall's death has led to a great deal of litigation none of which I suspect has been of much benefit to the plaintiffs (the ""Marshalls"").  In these proceedings they sue a solicitor based in South Australia, Mr Michael Prescott.  As I will explain, some time shortly after the accident Mr Prescott commenced to act on behalf of the families of some of the persons who had died in the accident, including Ms Carruthers.  In 2001 he contacted Mrs Marshall for the purpose of ascertaining whether she wished to join in litigation in the United States against entities associated with the manufacture and installation of the engine in the aircraft (""Lycoming"").  Mrs Marshall referred Mr Prescott to her solicitor, Mr Goldberg from Turner Freeman.  Thereafter Mr Prescott played a co-ordinating role on behalf of his own clients and the legal representatives of other families of victims of the crash in relation to, amongst other matters, the litigation in the United States.
3Mr Prescott's efforts led to success.  He made contact with a New York based firm, Kreindler & Kreindler (""Kreindlers"").  With its assistance, litigation funding was arranged and proceedings were commenced in Pennsylvania (the ""Pennsylvania proceedings"").  As noted below there was considerable debate about who retained Kreindlers and for whose benefit the Pennsylvania proceedings were conducted.  I do not consider it necessary to resolve that dispute.  There is also a dispute as to whether any duty owed by Mr Prescott to Mrs Marshall was qualified by the fact known to all that he was retained by Ms Carruthers.  I find that it was. 
4The Pennsylvania proceedings settled in principle in early 2003 and an agreed amount was allocated for distribution in respect of each deceased. Shortly afterwards Mr Goldberg wrote to Kreindlers demanding the unconditional release of those funds to Turner Freeman. Kreindlers resisted stating that it was concerned about a competing claim by Ms Carruthers. Eventually it provided the funds but only on condition that Mrs Marshall commence proceedings to vindicate her entitlement to the funds and they not be distributed without a court order. In the meantime Mr Prescott's retainer with Mrs Marshall was terminated.
5After receiving the funds Mrs Marshall commenced proceedings against Ms Carruthers concerning their respective entitlements to the settlement proceeds (the ""Marshall proceedings""). Mr Prescott acted for Ms Carruthers for a period.  He ceased to act in June 2005 although he continued to assist her after that time.  In November 2005 Mrs Marshall commenced proceedings against Mr Prescott (the ""Prescott proceedings"").  She obtained an interlocutory injunction against Mr Prescott preventing him from assisting Ms Carruthers.  Eventually she obtained final relief by consent to that effect and an order for the payment of her costs on  a party/party basis.  She also obtained consent orders in the Marshall proceedings which represented almost complete success. The end result was that she obtained the entirety of the settlement funds and an order for the payment of an agreed amount for party/party costs.
6Mrs Marshall sues Mr Prescott to recover the difference between the solicitor/client assessment of her costs of the Marshall proceedings and the Prescott proceedings and the amounts already recovered for costs pursuant to the orders just noted.  She and Kim Marshall also seek exemplary and punitive damages. They allege that certain conduct by Mr Prescott and others which was alleged to be in breach of various legal duties he is said to have owed to them led to Kreindlers imposing the conditions that it did on the release of the settlement funds which in turn precipitated the Marshall proceedings and then the Prescott proceedings. They also allege that the conduct of Mr Prescott in acting for Ms Carruthers in the Marshall proceedings and then providing her informal assistance was in breach of various legal duties owed by him.
7For the reasons that follow, the Marshalls' case must fail.  This is principally so because, as framed, the case against Mr Prescott failed to have proper regard to the authorities binding on this Court at first instance which hold that any fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott to the Marshalls ceased on the termination of his retainer in May 2003.  The case pleaded in the Further Amended Statement of Claim (""FASOC"") only involved a very narrow set of allegations against Mr Prescott in respect of his conduct before the retainer was terminated.  None of them was established as a matter of fact.
8The balance of the case concerned Mr Prescott's conduct after the termination of his retainer.  It is very unwise for a solicitor who is retained by multiple clients even on a limited basis to later act for one of those clients in a dispute between them.  Such conduct will often lead to the solicitor being injuncted from acting, as Mr Prescott was in this case.  Nevertheless the only relevant legal obligation owed by Mr Prescott to Mrs Marshall after the termination of his retainer that supported a claim for damages was his ongoing obligation of confidence.  The Marshalls have failed to establish that the pleaded breaches of this obligation were made out.
9The balance of this judgment is structured as follows:[10] to [32]:Mr Prescott's retainer[33] to [43]: The Pennsylvania Proceedings[44] to [50]: The settlement of the Pennsylvania proceedings[51] to [70]: The termination of Mr Prescott's retainer[71] to [86]: The release of the funds and the commencement of the Marshall proceedings[87] to [93]: The Prescott proceedings[94] to [97]: The resolution of the Prescott Proceedings and the Marshall proceedings[98] to [100]:The solicitor/client costs incurred by Mrs Marshall[101] to [107]: Kreindlers' retainer and the complaint[108] to [133]:The fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott to the plaintiffs[134] to [141]:Res judicata and issue estoppels relied on by the plaintiffs[142] to [192]: Breach of Confidence[143] to [149]: -  Background[150] to [156]: -  Principles[157] to [162]: -  All the information obtained by Mr Prescott[163] to [191 ] :-  Schedule A information[192]:-  Conclusion[193] to [197]:The pleaded case[198] to [217]:The (so called) Prescott's First Marshall Misconduct[218] to [228]:The (so called) Prescott's Second Marshall Misconduct [229] to [236]:The (so called) Prescott's Third Marshall Misconduct [237]:The (so called) Prescott's Fourth Marshall Misconduct [238] to [253]:Mr Prescott's estoppel defences[254]:Proportionate liability[255] to [256]:Causation and quantum[257]: Orders
Mr Prescott's retainer
10Mrs Marshall and the late Mr Marshall were married in 1967.  Kim Marshall was born in 1980. In December 1992 he executed his last will naming Mrs Marshall as the executrix.  At some point the marriage broke down.  In 1995 Mr Marshall commenced a de facto relationship with Ms Carruthers.  In 1996 Mr and Mrs Marshall effected a property settlement but they did not divorce.
11As noted, on 31 May 2000 Mr Marshall was killed in an aircraft accident in the Spencer Gulf.  Seven other persons on the plane were killed.
12On 9 November 2000 probate of  Mr Marshall's will was granted to Mrs Marshall.
13In December 2000 Ms Carruthers commenced proceedings under the Family Provision Act 1982 (the ""FPA proceedings"").
14At some point in this period Ms Carruthers retained Mr Prescott to act on her behalf in any claim for compensation arising out of the accident.  Mr Prescott also received instructions to act on behalf of the families of some of the other persons killed in the accident and was in contact with the legal representatives of the remainder.
15In May 2001 Mr Prescott telephoned Mrs Marshall.  According to Mrs Marshall he stated:
""I am acting for Linda Carruthers and families of victims of the crash, looking at bringing an action today or tomorrow in the United States in respect of all the victims of the crash. Is Kim interested in participating?""
Mrs Marshall replied:  ""I am Neil's wife and Kim's mother.  Kim is not here.""
Mr Prescott then stated:  ""I don't know anything about you.""
Mrs Marshall then referred Mr Prescott to  her solicitors, Turner Freeman.  If it was not otherwise obvious, Mrs Marshall accepted in her oral evidence that she knew that Mr Prescott acted for Ms Carruthers. 
16This conversation appears to have led to a conversation between Mr Goldberg and Mr Prescott on the morning of 29 May 2001.  Mr Prescott did not give evidence in these proceedings.  Mr Goldberg did but he did not address this conversation.  In any event, later that day Mr Goldberg wrote to Mr Prescott referring to their conversation, confirming that Turner Freeman acted for Kim Marshall and Margaret Marshall, providing certain details such as their address and occupation, and stating ""they instruct you to arrange for Roger Clark, lawyer in the USA to issue a complaint/court process in California (or Florida or anywhere he sees fit) to preserve their rights arising out of the crash in which Neil Marshall died"".  Mr Clark was an aviation law specialist based in California.
17On 31 May 2001 Mr Prescott wrote to Turner Freeman outlining the result of his work to that point in identifying potential causes of action that could be pursued in the USA against the manufacturer of the aircraft's engine, the forum in which to sue and the potential sources of litigation funding.  It is clear that the letter was a standard one sent to all the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.  At the conclusion of the letter Mr Prescott listed the names of each deceased, their dependants and legal representatives ""[i]n order that everyone is aware as to the potential parties and their representation"".  In respect of Mr Marshall he stated:
""Deceased:  Neil MarshallKim Neil Marshall (son)Linda Hope Carruthers (de facto)Represented by:  Michael Prescott at Prescotts
Margaret Lesley MarshallRepresented by:  Turner Freeman, Sydney.""
18On 14 June 2001 Mr Goldberg wrote to Mr Prescott, acknowledging receipt of his letter but asking him to note that Turner Freeman acted for Kim Marshall as well as Mrs Marshall.  He noted that ""[w]e obviously have no difficulty with you acting as overall representative in terms of liaising with Roger Clark on behalf of our clients"".
19On 26 July 2001 a judge of the (then) Compensation Court of New South Wales awarded Ms Carruthers $200,000.00 based on her being a dependant on Mr Marshall.  Nothing was awarded to Mrs Marshall or Kim Marshall.  (Mr Marshall's death arose out of his travelling in the course of his work as a trade union organiser.)
20On 3 August 2001 Macready AsJ made orders in  the FPA proceedings.  His Honour awarded Ms Carruthers a half interest in Mr Marshall's property at Newtown on certain conditions, as well as certain items of personalty with Kim Marshall to receive a legacy out of the estate. 
21Mr Prescott pursued litigation funding from Insolvency Litigation Fund Pty Ltd (""ILF"") for him and counsel retained by him, Mr Greenwell, to travel to the USA and investigate the claim.  ILF appears to be an entity associated with the Insolvency Management Fund (""IMF""), an Australian based litigation funder. On 21 November 2001 Mrs Marshall signed the funding agreement with ILF on her own behalf and on behalf of Kim Marshall. Paragraph D of the recitals to this funding agreement records that the ""Appointor"", namely Mrs Marshall, claims to be entitled to be paid money from certain entities arising from the aeroplane crash.
22Clause 5.3 provided that the ""Lawyers"", being Mr Prescott and Mr Greenwell, were retained by the Appointor but would be paid directly by ILF.  Otherwise the agreement made provision for the Appointor to nominate ILF as debt collector to recover loss arising out of the accident and conferred on ILF rights to receive reports and information from the ""Lawyers"" and Kreindlers.  (It thus appears that contact had been made with Kreindlers by this time.)  Clause 9.1 granted ILF first right to recover the investigation costs, the costs of funding any litigation and 20% of any settlement received on or before 30 June 2002, and 30% of any settlement received after.  As explained below, these fee arrangements were subsequently amended.
23On 7 February 2002 Mr Prescott sent a detailed letter to all of the representatives, including Mr Goldberg, updating them on the outcome of their research into liability, the appropriate forum and the obtaining of litigation funding.  He  referred to discussions he had with Kreindlers who was said to be ""very keen to run this action in the United States"".  Kreindlers was said to regard the case as having great  merit but be concerned about whether the United States was the appropriate forum. His letter advised that he had been ""looking at an agreement with the Americans [ie Kreindlers] at 30% of the damages recovered"" as well as an agreement with the ""Australian funder"", IMF, under which a further 30% would be taken.  Despite this he outlined how both had agreed to each take a 20% share of any verdict.  Mr Prescott also advised that the proceedings ""will be run not as a class action but rather on an individual basis"" with a ""separation of claims on behalf of the passengers as opposed to both the airline and the pilot's family"".  He concluded by emphasising the importance of finalising the various agreements. 
24On 22 February 2002 Mrs Marshall's appeal against Macready AsJ's judgment was upheld (Marshall v Carruthers; Marshall v Marshall [2002] NSWCA 47).  Hodgson JA (with whom Young CJ in Eq and Palmer J agreed) found that Ms Carruthers had failed to establish that the ""provision for her was inadequate for her proper maintenance"" (at [67]).  In the judgment, his Honour referred to Ms Carruthers as Mr Marshall's ""de facto wife"".
25On 20 March 2002 Mr Prescott circulated an email to the various representatives stating that he and Mr Green had been ""able to arrange funding for the US claim through ILF in Sydney"".  The proposed contingency fee was reduced to one third of the total verdict excluding out of pocket expenses so that ""[n]et recovery is the gross settlement less out of pocket expenses"".  The contingency fee was proposed to be split between ILF and Kreindlers, with one third to be paid to the former and two thirds to the latter.  He stressed the urgency for the signing of the retainer agreements for both ILF and Kreindlers and added:
""Firstly, the US agreement is to be signed by one person on behalf of all plaintiffs claiming under a deceased. I am advised that this person must be the executor or administrator of the estate. In the [United States] they are known as 'estate representatives'. These people sign on behalf of all plaintiffs even if they did not have any entitlement under the will or the Act.
The ILF require that each potential adult plaintiff sign and if they have plaintiff dependants, then on their behalf also.""  (emphasis added)
26On 21 March 2002 Mr Prescott and Mr Goldberg exchanged emails in relation to the execution of Kreindlers' retainer agreement.  On that day Mrs Marshall signed its retainer.  Underneath her signature appeared the words ""In respect of the death of Neil Marshall"" and against the phrase ""Full Name of signatory"" she was described as ""(Executor/Personal Representative)"".
27On the same day each of Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall separately signed a revised funding agreement with ILF.  This agreement was similar to the previous one although it contemplated that proceedings would be commenced.  Paragraph H of the recitals to the agreement records  that the ""Appointor"" had appointed Kreindlers to conduct proceedings in the USA on the basis that Kreindlers fund all costs and disbursements other than those expressly agreed to be paid by ILF.
28Clause 5.3 again provided that the ""Lawyers"" (ie Mr Prescott and Mr Greenwell) would be retained by the ""Appointor"" and be paid directly by ILF.  Clause 10 dealt with the procedure to be adopted if a settlement was proposed.  ILF's fees were revised so that after repayment of investigation and funding costs, it was to receive 11.111% of any settlement or judgment achieved in proceedings in the United States, and 35% of any settlement or judgment achieved from any proceedings that might be conducted in Australia.
29The next day Mr Goldberg wrote to Mr Prescott enclosing the signed agreements. In relation to Kreindlers' retainer agreement, Mr Goldberg stated:
""[We enclose the] Kreindler and Kreindler retainer agreement signed by Margaret Marshall. As we understand it, this agreement is signed on behalf of Kim Marshall and Linda Carruthers, correct us if we are wrong."" (emphasis added)
30In her affidavit Mrs Marshall stated that she executed, inter alia, this agreement ""on my own behalf and on behalf of Kim"".  In cross examination Mr Goldberg stated that before Mrs Marshall signed Kreindlers' retainer agreement he told her that she would be signing on behalf of Kim Marshall and Ms Carruthers.  Mrs Marshall stated that she could not remember being told that but when shown Mr Goldberg's letter was prepared to accept that ""he did tell me"".  I am satisfied that she was told. 
31At this point it is only necessary to note that, irrespective of whether this letter had the effect of making Ms Carruthers a party to the retainer agreement with Kreindlers, at the very least it reflects a common position between Mr Prescott and Mr Goldberg (and Mrs Marshall, Kim Marshall and Ms Carruthers) that Kreindlers was engaged to work to further the interests of all the claimants and potential claimants claiming through the late Mr Marshall, namely Mrs Marshall, Kim Marshall and Ms Carruthers.
32On or about 8 April 2002 Ms Carruthers also signed the revised funding agreement with ILF.  It was in the same terms as the agreement signed by Mrs Marshall, but this time defined Ms Carruthers as the ""Appointor"".  Thus the recitals recorded that she ""claim[ed] to be entitled"" to be paid money by certain entities as a result of the crash, and that she had appointed Kreindlers to conduct proceedings in the United States.  It also includes clause 5.3 pursuant to which she appointed Mr Prescott and Mr Greenwell.
The Pennsylvania Proceedings
33On 29 May 2002 the Pennsylvania proceedings were commenced in the United States District Court Middle District of Pennsylvania.  Lycoming was the defendant.  The plaintiffs are described in the complaint as ""Margaret Lesley Marshall and Kim Neil Marshall, individually and as Executors and Personal Representatives of the Estate of Neil Marshall, Deceased"".  The complaint included the following paragraphs:
""2. Plaintiffs MARGARET LESLEY MARSHALL and KIM NEIL MARSHALL have been or will be appointed Executors and Personal Representatives of the Estate of Neil Marshall (the 'Estate') and they bring this lawsuit in said capacity on behalf of the Estate and surviving family members of Neil Marshall.

As a result of the foregoing, the plaintiffs MARGARET LESLEY MARSHALL and KIM NEIL MARSHALL, the decedent's survivors and the Estate of Neil Marshall are entitled to recover the full wrongful death and survival compensatory damages, including damages for loss of the decedent's earnings, loss of support, loss of services, loss of prospective inheritance and future accumulations, loss of protection, care, counsel, society and companionship, loss of parental training, education, care and guidance, loss of consortium, the decedent's mental and physical pain and suffering and fear of impending death, burial and funeral expenses, punitive damages and other damages for economic and intangible losses as may be permitted by Pennsylvania law.""  (emphasis added)
The complaint concluded with the following recitation:
""Wherefore, plaintiffs MARGARET LESLEY MARSHALL and KIM NEIL MARSHALL, as Executors and Personal Representatives of the Estate of Neil Marshall, deceased, and on behalf of all heirs and next of kin of Neil Marshall, deceased, demands judgment against defendants ...""  (emphasis added)
34On their face the emphasised portions of these parts of the pleading are capable of referring to Ms Carruthers. In December 2006 Mr Goldberg obtained an opinion from a law firm in Pennsylvania which in part addressed this.  I discuss this below (at [93] and [107]).
35On 21 June 2002 Mr Prescott sent a copy of the pleadings filed in Pennsylvania to Mr Goldberg.
36On 25 July 2002 Mr Goldberg sent an email to Mr Green at Kreindlers which was copied to Mr Prescott.  He stated, inter alia:
""I now understand that you would like us to provide you with more information as to the assessment of damages.  I can only do that in respect of Kim and Margaret, but not Linda.  Michael Prescott and I have an agreement that I will send material to you directly.  By way of background, I advise that my clients and Linda have been involved as opposing parties in various actions in Court here over the estate of Neil Marshall, and their relationship is not good.""  (emphasis added)
37Mr Goldberg also queried paragraph 20 of the complaint  and the manner in which damages were calculated and recovered.  He stated, inter alia:
""There is no guidance on this provided in the statement of claim/ complaint other than paragraph 20.  I would point out that my two clients and Linda Carruthers are adults and in New South Wales where I practice law, damages are not awarded to adults in respect of many of the losses that are set out in paragraph 20 of the complaint.  How will the US Court calculate damages for 'loss of services' and 'loss of parental support'?"" (emphasis added)
38Mr Goldberg sent a further email on 29 July 2002 which was apparently in response to an email from Mr Green at Kreindlers that was not tendered.  The opening part of the e-mail is of particular significance.  Mr Goldberg stated:
""As I have previously advised you, all matters relating to damages in respect of Kim Marshall and Margaret Marshall ... have to be dealt with directly with me, and not Prescotts.  We do not and cannot act for Linda Carruthers. I have discussed these issues with Michael Prescott and as I understand it, he and his client agree with this approach.""  (emphasis added)
39Mr Goldberg then posed a number of detailed questions for Mr Green about the manner of assessment of damages in respect of the proceedings commenced in Pennsylvania.  The closing part of the e-mail stated:
""I look forward to your detailed and complete response.  Please note that the response should be forwarded to me only at first instance and not forwarded to Prescotts.  These inquiries are made in my capacity as solicitor for the Marshalls and for the Estate in whose interests we understand you act. I am anxious to avoid conflicts of interest.""  (emphasis added)
40On 30 July 2002 Mr Green responded.  He expressed concern about the delays in obtaining information.  He provided a short summary response to Mr Goldberg's questions addressing the position if the matter was covered by US law as follows:
""The action[s] in the US have been, and had to be, brought by the personal representative of the decedent's estate, but are brought on behalf of the estate and the decedent's survivors. If the court applies US law, each dependant survivor will obtain an award for loss of support and an award will be made to the estate for the decedent's pre-death pain and suffering. If there are no dependent survivors, an estate accumulations award will be made to the estate and will go to the estate beneficiaries.  The award for pain and suffering would not be a 'personal' recovery as I understand your question.""
41Mr Goldberg responded on 31 July 2002 raising the existence of a possible conflict of interest on the part of Kreindlers for the first time stating, inter alia: ""[i]n my opinion there are potential problems in you acting for Carruthers and for my clients.  Their respective interests are not the same and part of the problem in supplying the information you want is caused by their conflicts"".
42On 1 August 2002 Mr Green responded by rejecting the existence of any conflict. He stated that ""I have been retained by each decedent's estate and my only role is to maximise the recovery for each decedent's estate"". He stated that his role was that he would ""not be involved with any intra or inter-family disputes and the distribution of the monies is a separate issue"".
43The debate continued in an exchange of emails on 5 August 2012. Mr Goldberg advised that his client had ""an objection to you communicating with Carruthers in any way or even acting in her interests"".  He reminded  them that the Court of Appeal found that Ms Carruthers had no interest in the estate.  Mr Green responded that his firm only acted for the estate and that to the extent there was a dispute between those who claimed to have an interest in the estate then Kreindlers ""cannot become involved"" and added ""[i]f Linda Carruthers was not dependent on the decedent and doesn't have an interest in the estate, then there won't be any dispute"".  He reminded Mr Goldberg that this was a debate for a later time as they had to overcome a motion to dismiss the proceedings on a forum non conveniens basis and, if so, then prove liability.
The settlement of the Pennsylvania  proceedings
44On 11 February 2003 Mr Bowman, the IMF representative, circulated an email advising the various representatives that a meeting on that day had been arranged between [him] and Mr Green and representatives of Lycoming.  He advised that it was anticipated that the discussions would cover the potential for settlement and noted that:
""Before any offer of settlement can be properly assessed, each Plaintiff will need to know what their share of the settlement amount will be. The plaintiffs have agreed to be bound by an advice from Justin as to how much each plaintiff is likely to receive in the US should the cases be successful. Each Plaintiff will then receive its proportionate share of the settlement sum.""
45This prompted a further request from Mr Goldberg to Mr Green about the manner in which damages would be calculated.  On 13 February 2003 Mr Green responded.  His email set out three caveats.  First, there was likely to be a significant contest as to whether the damages were governed by US law or Australian law.  Second, the quantum of damages would ultimately be determined by a jury and thus there was no ""formula"" to be applied.  Third, any estimate of damages had to reflect the risk of losing the forum non conveniens argument or failing to establish liability.  Mr Green's email then addressed the method of calculating damages if ""US law"" was applicable.  He did not state whether there were differences between the various states or if any particular considerations applied to cases litigated in Pennsylvania.  His advice confirmed that the calculation of the amount payable in respect of each deceased was determined principally, and perhaps solely, by reference to the deceased's earning capacity and imputed pain and suffering as opposed to, by way of example, determining an amount of loss per dependant.
46Mr Green sent a further email to Mr Goldberg on 15 February 2003 stating as follows:
""I can only say what the law is here in the United States.  Wrongful death damages are not estate assets - they are paid to the survivors and do not pass through the estate.  The persons entitled to the damages are identified in the intestate law - spouse, children and maybe parents typically (parents are generally cut out if there are children).  Wrongful death damages are awarded based upon the survivors' loss.
Damages awarded to compensate for the pain and suffering of the decedent are estate assets and go through the estate.  If there is a settlement, we generally ask the Court to award very little for pain and suffering - in the U.S. wrongful death damages are not taxed, but estate assets are subject to estate tax.
If we obtain a settlement, the proceeds will likely be distributed in accordance with Australian law since the estates are all in Australia.
Hope that this answers your questions.""
47On 19 February 2003 Mr Greenwell sent an email to the various representatives attaching a document which provided a breakdown of the percentage of any total settlement that was payable to ""each Plaintiff"".
48Sometime around 21 February 2003 and at the time the motion to dismiss was due to be heard an in-principle settlement of the Pennsylvanian proceedings was reached.  Lycoming agreed to pay US $5.5 million in total.
49On 26 February 2003 Mr Goldberg sent a detailed letter posing a series of questions to Mr Green concerning the quantification of damage, the apportionment of amounts for economic loss and pain and suffering, and the taxation treatment of the amounts paid.  He advised Mr Green that it was ""important that we obtain answers to [the questions] given that there have been substantial disputes in the past in respect of distributions of money flowing to the estate of [the] late Neil Marshall which has resulted in two sets of Court proceedings in New South Wales so far"".
50On 14 March 2003 a meeting was held at Mr Greenwell's chambers in Adelaide.  A number of the legal representatives of the families attended including Mr Brett Allen from Turner Freeman.  Mr Allen made a file note of the meeting which he sent to Mr Goldberg on 17 March 2006.  Mr Allen's note records a discussion concerning the cost and logistics of effecting the settlement.  The note also included the following:
""Michael Prescott raises the potential issue of Marshall and Carruthers' competing claims.  Michael Prescott says that 100% of the amount recovered on behalf of Marshall should go to the estate and be held in trust pending agreement between Mrs Marshall and Ms Carruthers.
Michael Prescott told BMA that Michael would not be instructed to act for Carruthers in any dispute with Mrs Marshall.""
The termination of Mr Prescott's retainer
51On 8 April 2003 Mr Greenwell sent a letter to Mr Goldberg attaching a copy of the final agreed percentage allocations in respect of each deceased. The nominated percentage in respect of Mr Marshall was 8.75%.
52On the same day Mr Goldberg wrote an emphatic letter to Kreindlers.  It constituted a demand that Kreindlers forward the entire net amount of the settlement proceeds that concerned Mr Marshall to Turner Freeman.  To support this demand it set out three assertions under the headings ""Proposition 1"", ""Proposition 2"" and ""Proposition 3"".  Proposition 1 was that Kreindlers and Turner Freeman acted for the same clients, namely Kim Marshall and Mrs Marshall individually and Mrs Marshall in Mrs Marshall's capacity as executor of Mr Marshall's estate.  Later in the letter it was asserted that the ""only retainer"" Kreindlers had was with Mrs Marshall (ie it did not extend to Ms Carruthers).  The letter enclosed Kreindlers' retainer agreement but did not enclose a copy of Mr Goldberg's letter of 22 March 2002.  The second proposition was that the only persons who either had a ""legal interest"" or were entitled beneficially to a share in the proceeds were Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall. This was said to follow from the terms of the court process filed in the Pennsylvanian proceedings that are extracted above.
53The third proposition in Mr Goldberg's letter was said to be as follows:
""Any failure on the part of Kreindler & Kreindler or Turner Freeman to ensure that the settlement amount is distributed in accordance with the explicit instructions of the Marshalls will involve a breach of the professional obligations of those attorneys to their mutual clients.""
54Mr Green responded by letter dated the same day and apparently received by facsimile by Turner Freeman on 9 April 2003. In view of how Mrs Marshall's case was put it is necessary to set out the text of the response:
""This responds to your facsimile of April 8, 2003.  We represent the Marshall estate[s] in this matter and cannot become involved in a dispute between individual estates or wrongful death distributees.  The representatives of the Marshall estate[s] owe a fiduciary duty to ensure that the settlement is distributed equitably to all persons entitled to receive the proceeds under Australian law.  If a potential claimant is cut off, that claimant may sue the estate representative and the estate[s] lawyers for breach of their fiduciary duty.  Distributing the settlement proceeds without dealing with these issues is contrary to your clients' interests.
Your letter is not clear.  You need to clearly inform me of the dispute between potential settlement distributees.  What is the problem?
Unless an agreement can be reached, we will have to hold the settlement until a court of competent jurisdiction, most likely in Australia, rules on the proper settlement distributees.""  (emphasis added)
55On 9 April 2003 Mr Goldberg wrote to Mr Greenwell terminating his retainer on behalf of Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall.  The next day he wrote to Mr Green reiterating his request for Kreindlers to account to them for the total amount of the net settlement referable to Mr Marshall. He pointed out that the relevant ""Australian law"" as referred to by Mr Green was the law of New South Wales and the only persons with any rights to claim against the estate of the deceased person under that law were Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall.
56It seems that one letter to Mr Green on 10 April 2003 was not enough. Mr Goldberg wrote again to him on that day. He complained about the adequacy of Mr Green's response and asserted that Ms Carruthers was a mere spectator to the Pennsylvania proceedings.
57Mr Green emailed his response to Mr Goldberg almost immediately at 5.50am on 11 April 2003.  Not surprisingly he described Mr Goldberg's recent communications as ""unfair"".  His response included the following:
""Third, you are wrong about the law, at least here in the United States.  Because Mrs. Marshall has brought the action on behalf of the Marshall estate, she has a fiduciary duty to distribute the settlement proceeds to those persons who are entitled to receive the money.  Only the estate personal representative has standing to bring the lawsuit here in the U.S., so even if a third party is entitled to settlement proceeds they have no standing to sue.  For example, if a widow is appointed and sues on behalf of her late husband's estate, she brings the action on her own behalf and on the behalf of everyone who is entitled to receive wrongful death damages.
We have to come up with a plan that will not put the Marshalls at risk.  Usually, the best course is to have the third party agree to the distribution, even if they do not receive anything. Is that possible?  If not, a court of competent jurisdiction would have to rule on the distribution.  That Court would have to be in Australia.  If you are correct that Australian law would provide the full recovery to the Marshalls, it should be no problem getting a Court to order that distribution.
I suggest that we get an agreement that the entire net settlement be paid to Mrs. Marshall as estate representative and that settlement will be held in an interest bearing account until you get court approval to distribute it only to the Marshalls.
Pass this e-mail on to Mrs. Marshall and Kim Marshall. Please contact my office so that we can set up a telephone conference with the Marshalls at their first convenience so that we can deal with this problem.""  (emphasis added)
58Mr Goldberg sent a letter to Mr Green on the same day.  He referred to the ""frustration and anger"" that he and his clients apparently felt.  He rejected Mr Green's proposals in strident language and rejected any suggestion that Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall were at risk.  He told Mr Green to carry out his clients' instructions and that if they did not receive an ""unequivocal acknowledgement"" of them the Marshalls would terminate Kreindlers' retainer.
59On 13 April 2003 Mr Greenwell sent an email to Mr Green.  He attached a copy of the letter from Mr Goldberg dated 22 March 2002.  This email is a critical part of one of the central allegations against Mr Prescott and it is necessary to set it out in full:
""Further to our telephone conversation on Friday night (local time) I indicated to you that Prescott had today sent me a letter from Turner Freeman dated 22nd March 2002, which I pass on to you for your attention.  It's clear from that letter that Goldberg returned the signed Kreindler and Kreindler retainer agreement, executed by Margaret Marshall, on behalf of Kim Marshall and Linda Carruthers.  At least at that stage, it would appear, that both Mr Goldberg and his client were aware that Margaret Marshall was the nominee for the estate of Mr Marshall and that apart from any interest that she may or may not have they recognise that there are at least 2 other persons, Kim Marshall and Linda Carruthers, who also have an interest.  She is a fiduciary with respect to those interests.""
60On 15 April 2003 a four page letter was sent by Kreindlers to Mr Goldberg. It was signed by Mr Francis G. Fleming.  Mr Fleming advised that he was ""the oldest and most experienced lawyer"" at the firm who had worked on the case.  Mr Fleming passed over what he described as the ""offensive remarks"" in Mr Goldberg's letter and simply noted that the ""tone and character"" of Mr Goldberg's letter were not helpful.  He then addressed the respective positions of Mr Goldberg's clients and Ms Carruthers in respect of the proceeds of the settlement.  His conclusion was that ""[u]nder Pennsylvanian law, since Ms Carruthers has been recognized by an Australian Court as the de facto spouse, she would have a claim to the wrongful death recovery [component of the claim] assuming that Australian law treats de facto spouses as de jure spouses in these types of actions"".  He suggested that the best means of resolving the matter was by agreement or suggested that a third party custodian might be utilised.  He also offered to obtain a further opinion from Mr Cliff Rieders who was the local counsel engaged in Pennsylvania.  Consistent with the position taken by Mr Green the previous year, Mr Fleming described Kreindlers' role in the following terms:
""Our professional responsibilities are to maximize the recovery from Lycoming, but once that is done we can take no part in a dispute on allocation.""  
61Mr Green followed up this letter with an email. In his email he denied having any communications with ""counsel for Ms Carruthers"", which was presumably a reference to Mr Prescott, ""regarding the settlement"".  It was contended that this statement was false given the e-mail of 13 April 2003 (see [59]).  It is not necessary for me to determine that question.  Mr Green said that he had ""only stated that all those legally entitled to the settlement proceeds must agree to the distribution"". 
62Mr Goldberg wrote to Mr Fleming on 24 April 2003 rejecting his advice but indicating that he would take up the matter with Mr Rieders.  On the same day he sent a five page letter posing 24 questions for Mr Rieders.
63On 25 April 2003 Mr Green sent Mr Greenwell an email which was copied to Mr Bowman.  There is no evidence that it was sent to Mr Prescott although it was submitted that Mr Greenwell was Mr Prescott's ""agent"" for that purpose.  As the email was alleged to have conspiratorial overtones it is appropriate to set it out in full:
""Please keep this confidential:  I have been contacted by a lawyer here in the U.S. that was contacted by the solicitor for Carruthers.  Luckily he works for a firm that knows our reputation and gave me the courtesy of calling before doing anything else.  Apparently Carruthers wanted to know what could be done in the U.S. to prevent all of the Marshall settlement being paid to Mrs. Marshall and Kim.  I told him that I wasn't able to speak with him in substance, but that filing anything would be untimely since Marshall has not signed the release yet.
By separate e-mail I am going to send you the draft releases.  I will be working on finalizing the releases and sending them down to you to have executed.  It is very important that Marshall executes the release.""
64On the same day Mr Green sent Mr Goldberg a draft release for execution in relation to the settlement.
65On 28 April 2003 Mr Bowman prepared a letter for sending to Mr Goldberg which he ultimately did not send.  Like Kreindlers, Mr Bowman was proposing to point out that he, and inferentially IMF, had no interest in who was entitled to so much of the proceeds of the settlement as concerned Mr Marshall.  His letter was annotated with the following:
""Not sent.  Justin Green is to address Turner Freeman's concerns. Justin says - under Pennsylvanian law - dependent (ie Kim) would get pain and suffering award [and] wife would get balance - Mrs Marshall would get it ([because Mr Marshall] is still married to her) but Justin says [Australian] law as to who is the wife would apply - would be that Ms Carruthers [because] she is the defacto would be treated as the wife."" 
66The plaintiffs' written submissions in reply dated 19 August 2013 (at [5]) assert that this file note is evidence ""that Mr Green never believed, on the available evidence, that Carruthers had any entitlement whatsoever under Pennsylvania law"", and that he ""well knew her to be persona non grata under Pennsylvania law"".  I do not agree.  Instead it recorded Mr Green's opinion that the interaction of so much of Australian law that might recognise as Mr Marshall's de facto spouse with Pennsylvanian law might lead to Ms Carruthers having an entitlement in respect of the settlement funds.
67On 16 May 2003 Mr Rieders wrote to Mr Goldberg in response to the letter of 24 May 2013 which Mr Rieders had received on 30 April 2013.  Amongst other matters he explained that in Pennsylvania the right to sue for the benefit of the estate is held by the personal representative of the estate ""for the benefit of the spouse, children or parties"" and that the ""[p]roceeds are distributed according to the rules of intestacy, regardless of the existence of a will"".  However it was clear that Mr Rieders regarded the rights to the proceeds as being governed by Australian law which he stated he would not comment upon.  He also pointed out that the fact that Ms Carruthers was not named as a party to the proceedings ""in her own name [was] not determinative"" in that a ""potential beneficiary of wrongful death proceeds does not need to be a party in her own name in order to have the right to participate in the recovery"".
68Also on 16 May 2003 a solicitor acting on behalf of Ms Carruthers from Teece, Hodgson & Ward, Mr Neal, emailed Mr Green.  He attached the letter of 22 March 2002 and stated that ""reflect[ed] the representative nature of [Kreindlers'] retainer"".  He asked Mr Green to hold the proceeds in escrow.  Mr Green immediately sent Mr Neal's e-mail to Mr Goldberg under cover of an e-mail stating:
""I just received the following email.  Please provide your input on how I should respond to the email and explain your letter which Mr Neal attached to the email.""
69On the morning of 22 May 2003 Sydney time, Mr Goldberg had a telephone conference with Messrs Green and Fleming at the chambers of Mr C.J. Bevan of Counsel.  Messrs Green and Fleming told him that the funds would not be released unless Mr Goldberg gave an undertaking on behalf of the Marshalls to seek a ruling from the ""Australian Court supervising the Estate"" as to the entitlements of Mrs Marshall and Ms Carruthers. 
70On 23 May 2003 Mr Goldberg wrote to Mr Prescott complaining that he had improperly provided Mr Neal with the letter of 22 March 2002. He asserted that his conduct involved a ""breach of client/legal professional privilege"".  He was asked to advise within seven days why Mrs Marshall should not be entitled to various forms of relief against him.  Although the letter did not expressly say so, it was common ground between the parties that this letter terminated Mr Prescott's retainer.
The release of the funds and the commencement of the Marshall proceedings
71Thereafter Mr Goldberg and Mr Green corresponded in relation to the release sought by Lycoming as a condition of the settlement.  One issue that arose concerned a clause of the release pursuant to which Mr Goldberg agreed to indemnify Lycoming in respect of claims made by third parties, including workers' compensation insurers.  In Mr Marshall's case there was a potential for such a claim in that, as noted, the GIO had paid out $200,000.00 to Ms Carruthers (see [19] above).
72Eventually on 13 June 2003 Mrs Marshall signed a Deed of Release.  On 25 June 2003 Mr Goldberg wrote to Kreindlers providing three undertakings required by Kreindlers before the proceeds of the settlement were released, namely undertakings not to release the funds without an order of this Court (other than to pay IMF's fees), to receive the funds on behalf of the estate of the late Mr Marshall and to serve all Court processes on Ms Carruthers by way of personal service.
73Over the next few weeks the funds were received by Turner Freeman with various fees paid to IMF.  In the end result an amount of AUD$420,115.57 was retained.
74On 17 July 2003 Mr Prescott wrote to Mr Goldberg  requesting, inter alia, that he retain the funds pending determination or agreement as to the respective entitlements and confirmation that Mr Goldberg's clients would  make application to this Court.  Mr Goldberg responded  the next day disputing various matters, but confirming those two.
75By October 2003 proceedings had not been commenced.  On 24 October 2003 Mr Prescott wrote to Mr Goldberg querying, inter alia, whether litigation had been or would be commenced and sought to have the settlement proceeds placed in an interest bearing joint account rather than a non-interest bearing account. 
76Mr Goldberg responded on 4 November 2003.  One matter he raised was the inappropriateness of Mr Prescott continuing to act when his firm had previously acted as ""the former estate solicitors in the US proceedings"".
77By this time the GIO had learned of the possibility of recovery.  It wrote letters to each of Mr Prescott and Mr Goldberg asserting its right to be  repaid out of the proceedings of the settlement of the Pennsylvania proceedings.  Mr Goldberg emphatically rejected the suggestion. However in a letter dated 25 November 2003  Mr Prescott stated that there was a comity of interest between his client and the GIO.  He suggested that the GIO fund and indemnify his client.
78On 30 April 2004 Mrs Marshall commenced the Marshall proceedings by filing a statement of claim in the Equity Division of this Court.  Ms Carruthers was named as a defendant.  Mrs Marshall sought declaratory relief to the effect that she was entitled to the entire net proceeds of settlement of the Pennsylvania proceedings retained by Turner Freeman.
79Mr Prescott continued to press the GIO for funding.  On 30 July 2004 he advised the GIO's solicitors that, having regard to her previous experience, his client would not under any ""circumstances run any action to challenge [Mrs Marshall's] summons on her own account"".  On 4 August 2004 the GIO solicitors advised Mr Prescott that they would agree to fund his appearance at the first return date of the proceedings.  There was a great deal of correspondence between Mr Prescott and the GIO's solicitors from this point through to 2005.  It suffices to state that from late 2004 to June 2005 the GIO funded Mr Prescott to act for Ms Carruthers on an interim basis (defined in the FASOC as the ""GIO interim litigation funding agreement"").
80On 15 October 2004 a defence and a cross claim were filed on behalf of Ms Carruthers.  Prescotts were the solicitors on the record.  Teece Hodgson & Ward were retained as their agents.  The cross claim sought a declaration to the effect that Ms Carruthers was entitled to the entirety of the amount retained by Turner Freeman.
81From this point into 2005 Mr Prescott continued to correspond with the GIO's solicitors in an effort to finalise a funding agreement.  On or around 9 June 2005 Ms Carruthers and the GIO entered into an agreement pursuant to which the latter agreed to fund the former's costs and disbursements in relation to the Marshall proceedings, and indemnify her against any adverse costs order or agreement to pay Mrs Marshall's costs (the ""GIO Final Litigation Funding Agreement"").  Paragraph F of the recitals to the agreement records that Ms Carruthers did not wish to defend the proceedings or pursue her cross claim without funding from the GIO.
82In the meantime, on 8 June 2005 Mr Prescott wrote to Mr Rieders seeking his opinion on various questions of law said to be relevant to Ms Carruthers' defence of the Marshall proceedings.  On 13 June 2005 Mr Rieders provided a short response.  He suggested that they hire an expert in Pennsylvania law and noted that he could not give any legal advice in ""connection with the Whyalla Airlines Crash"".
83On 10 June 2005 Teece Hodgson & Ward wrote to Mr Prescott on behalf of Ms Carruthers terminating his retainer.  The letter suggested that this had occurred because he was perceived to be ""a material witness"". Mr Prescott was asked to provide the materials in his possession including the contact details for Mr Rieders.
84Mr Prescott responded on 21 June 2005. In his letter he stated that, based on his discussions with the GIO's solicitors, ""a continued role [was] intended"" for him notwithstanding the termination of his retainer.  To that end he continued to correspond with Mr Rieders in an endeavour to obtain a suitable expert in Pennsylvanian law.  He discussed the provision of answers to particulars from solicitors from Teece Hodgson & Ward and corresponded with the GIO's solicitors in relation to the progress of the proceedings.
85On 21 October 2005 an attorney practising in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Cynthia Person, provided an opinion to the effect that the finding in the FPA proceedings that Ms Carruthers was the de facto spouse of Mr Marshall meant that, under the law of Pennsylvania, Ms Carruthers was entitled to half of the net proceeds of the settlement.
86There was other correspondence in the period after 8 June 2005 which was said by Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall to constitute a breach of confidence by Mr Prescott.  I address this below.
The Prescott Proceedings
87On 31 October 2005 a notice of motion was filed on behalf of Ms Carruthers in the Marshall proceedings which sought an extension of time to comply with earlier orders of the Court.  In support of the motion a solicitor from Teece Hodgson & Ward filed an affidavit.  It seems that the affidavit revealed the ongoing assistance being provided to Ms Carruthers by Mr Greenwell and Mr Prescott.  On 4 November 2005 Turner Freeman wrote to each of them referring to the previous retainer from Mrs Marshall and demanding they each provide a detailed undertaking to the Court to, inter alia, not act against her interest  or assist others to do so. They threatened to take proceedings if their demand was not complied with.
88Mr Prescott responded in  a letter dated 8 November 2005.  He denied that he ever acted for Mrs Marshall and stated that his ""role was no more than that of the co-ordinator of the various plaintiff solicitors acting for the various families in the crash"".  He addressed other matters raised by Mr Goldberg and refused to provide any undertaking. 
89On 9 November 2005 Mrs Marshall commenced the Prescott proceedings by filing a summons in the Equity Division of this Court.  She named each of Mr Prescott and Mr Greenwell as defendants.  The summons sought final and interlocutory injunctions restraining them from, inter alia, acting against the interests of Mrs Marshall, including by way of providing assistance to Ms Carruthers or her solicitors in the Marshall proceedings. 
90The application for interlocutory orders was returnable on 16 November 2005.  On that day Mr Greenwell proffered various undertakings to the Court.  The proceedings against him were dismissed by consent.  In the case of Mr Prescott,  Barrett J made interlocutory orders by consent to the effect of that sought in the summons (the ""Interlocutory Orders""). Mrs Marshall proffered the usual undertaking as to damages.
91As by then it had become apparent that, at its highest, Ms Carruthers could only claim half of the net proceeds of the settlement, Turner Freeman gave notice that it proposed to distribute half of the amount that it was holding. On 8 March 2006 Windeyer J dismissed an application by Ms Carruthers to restrain that from occurring.  Mrs Marshall's evidence was that the monies were released and applied for the payment of legal costs.
92Mrs Marshall then moved to strike out Ms Carruthers' defence and cross claim.  On 8 August 2006 Macready AsJ struck out certain parts of those pleadings and gave her liberty to replead.  However his Honour did not enter judgment against her, finding that there was a ""real controversy which should go to trial"".
93In December 2006 Tuner Freeman obtained a rival opinion from an attorney in Pennsylvania, Lynn Evans.  Ms Evans addressed a number of questions including who was entitled to share in the proceeds of the settlement monies.  Ms Evans concluded that Ms Carruthers was not so entitled.  Ms Evans was also asked whether ""Linda Hope Carruthers [was] named or referred to, directly or indirectly in the [complaint] as a party to or a beneficiary of the Pennsylvania proceedings?""  Ms Evans noted those parts of the complaint that I have extracted above which refer to ""surviving family members"" and ""next of kin"" and continued:
""In Pennsylvania, there is no statutory definition of 'family members'.  However, the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code does provide a rule of interpretation for wills which construes such terms as 'family', 'heirs' and 'next of kin.'  20 Pa.C.S.A. 2514(4)
2514.  Rules of Interpretation
In the absence of a contrary intent appearing therein, wills shall be construed as to real and personal estate in accordance with the following rules:
(4)  Meaning of 'heirs' and 'next of kin', etc.;  time of ascertaining class, - A devise or bequest of real or personal estate whether directly or in trust, to the testator's or another designated person's 'heirs' or 'next of kin' or 'relatives' or 'family' or to 'the persons thereunto entitled under the intestate laws' or to persons described by words of similar import, shall mean those persons, including the spouse, who would take under the intestate laws if the testator or other designated person were to die intestate at the time when such class is to be ascertained ...
Under the foregoing rule of interpretation, the 'family members,' 'heirs' and 'next of kin' of Neil Marshall are his surviving spouse and his child.  As discussed hereinabove at Paragraph 111(A)(1), under Pennsylvania law, Mr. Marshall's spouse was Margaret Lesley Marshall, and his sole child was Kim Neil Marshall.  There is no provision for any person equivalent to a de facto spouse in this rule of interpretation.  Therefore, Ms. Carruthers is not named or referred to as a party to or beneficiary of the Pennsylvania proceedings.""
The resolution of the Prescott Proceedings and the Marshall Proceedings
94On 28 February 2007 final orders were made by Macready AsJ by consent in the Prescott proceedings (the ""Consent Orders"").  The first order made was a declaration (the ""Consent Declaration"") which provided:
""1.  The first defendant was retained to act as a solicitor for the plaintiff, Kim Neil Marshall and the estate of the late Neil Marshall, on or about 29 May 2001 until about May 2003 in the following matters or proceedings, and to act for them in the various capacities referred to below (hereafter which are referred to collectively as 'the first defendant's retainer'), and in the case of sub-paragraph (e) below, he was retained to so act in addition to the firms of Turner Freeman, Lawyers, of Sydney, Kreindler & Kreindler, Attorneys, of New York and Rieders Travis Humphrey Harris Waters & Waffenschmidt, Attorneys, of Williamsport, Pennsylvania, namely:
(a) for the plaintiff in her own right or as executrix of the estate of the late Neil Marshall or in respect of her son, Kim Neil Marshall;
(b) for the plaintiff on behalf of her son, Kim Neil Marshall, in respect of which she acted as his agent to retain and instruct the first defendant;
(c) for Kim Neil Marshall thereafter on his own behalf;
(d) in the investigation of the plaintiff's legal rights in Australia and the United States of America (whether) arising out of the Whyalla Airline Plane crash on 31 May 2000 ('the Whyalla Airlines plane crash investigation');
(e) in relation to the conduct of proceedings Complaint no. 4: CV02-918 filed on 29 May 2002 at Williamsport (Docket of Judge Muir) in the US District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania ('the Pennsylvania Proceedings');
(f) in relation to the conduct of an inquest into the death of the late Neil Marshall in the Coroner's Court of Adelaide ('the Coroner's Court proceedings');
(g) in relation to the conduct of proceedings in the District Court of South Australia pursuant to the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act, 1959 (Cth) and the Civil Aviation (Carriers Liability) Act, 1962 (SA) ('the South Australian proceedings'),
(all of which are hereafter collectively referred to as 'the former proceedings').""  (emphasis in original)
95Orders 2(a), (b) and (c) of the Consent Orders permanently restrained Mr Prescott from accepting a retainer to act against Mrs Marshall, accepting a retainer to assist or otherwise assisting Ms Carruthers and ""waiving or otherwise communicating ... the terms of any confidential communication which he has had with [Mrs Marshall]"" in respect of his retainer respectively.  Order 2(d) restrained him permanently from ""otherwise breaching any obligation of confidence which he owes to [Mrs Marshall] in respect of [his] retainer, the [Pennsylvania proceedings] or the [Prescott proceedings]"".  Order 3 restrained him from communicating with various entities such as Teece Hodgson & Ward or Kreindlers about his retainer, the Pennsylvania proceedings or the Prescott proceedings.  Order 4 required him to deliver up various documents.
96Order 8 of the Consent Orders required Mr Prescott to pay Mrs Marshall's costs ""of and incidental to this proceeding, insofar as they related to claims for relief made against [Mr Prescott] (whether wholly or partly), up to and including the date of [the] orders, as agreed or assessed"".  An annotation to the orders recorded an agreement between the parties that Mrs Marshall would not make any application for any further order as to costs of the proceedings against Mr Prescott, adding that such further costs were ""incurred of an incidental to the determination of the issues remaining for determination as between the plaintiff and the intervenor which are referred to in order 7 above"".  This appears to relate to the costs being incurred in a privilege dispute between Mrs Marshall and Ms Carruthers which had spilled over into the Prescott proceedings.  This annotation recorded an agreement by Mrs Marshall to not seek any further costs from Mr Prescott incurred after the orders in relation to her ongoing dispute with Ms Carruthers.  It is not necessary to consider this further.  Although it was contended on behalf of Mr Prescott that Order 8 precluded recovery of part of the damages sought by Mrs Marshall, it was not contended that the annotation to that order had that effect.  The amount of party/party costs that Mr Prescott was ordered to pay in the Prescott proceedings was $114,156.15.
97On 23 July 2008 the Marshall proceedings were resolved by the entry of final orders also by consent.  As noted, half of the amount retained by Turner Freeman had previously been distributed.  These orders included a declaration  to the effect that Mrs Marshall was entitled  to the remainder and Ms Carruthers was not.  They also included orders requiring Ms Carruthers to pay Mrs Marshall's costs of the proceedings on a party/party basis.  The enforcement of that order was expressed to be discharged if the amount of $150,000.00 was paid on behalf of Ms Carruthers.  
The solicitor/client costs incurred by Mrs Marshall
98Mrs Marshall retained a very experienced solicitor and costs assessor, Gordon Salier, to report on the ""amount of costs recoverable on a solicitor/ client basis in respect of the work done"" for each of the Prescott proceedings and the Marshall proceedings. Mr Salier worked from a comprehensive bill prepared in each matter by a costs consultant, Chris Davitt. In the Prescott proceedings Mr Salier assessed them at $239,775.72.  As noted they were assessed on a party/party basis as $114,156.14 and that amount was paid on behalf of Mr Prescott.  The difference is $125,619.58.
99In the Marshall proceedings Mr Salier assessed the costs payable on a solicitor/client basis in the amount of $334,565.88.  As noted an amount of $150,000.00 was paid on account of her costs on behalf of Ms Carruthers.  The difference is $184,565.88.
100In his report Mr Salier identified a difficulty in assessing the costs in that he did not have any objections from Mr Prescott, although he stated he had regard to the objections lodged on behalf of Mr Prescott during the assessment of the costs on a party/party basis.  He did not have any such objections with the Marshall proceedings. In cross examination Mr Salier accepted that this was an ""inherently awkward task"" but he nevertheless attempted to adopt a ""devil's advocate"" role.  Even allowing for this limitation I accept Mr Salier's assessments as representing a fair and reasonable assessment of the costs incurred by Mrs Marsall in both sets of proceedings.
Kreindlers retainer and the complaint 
101At this point it is appropriate to note two matters that were the subject of various submissions which I do not consider are necessary to resolve.
102First, the parties devoted a considerable amount of energy to establishing whether or not Ms Carruthers had a retainer with Kreindlers. As best as I can ascertain the perceived significance of that circumstance was that it was thought to be relevant to the analysis of whether or not Kreindlers' insistence upon Mr Goldberg providing undertakings as a condition of his receiving the proceeds of the net settlement was a consequence of any conduct on the part of Mr Prescott.  Some of the submissions appeared to treat this issue as having significance to the scope of Mr Prescott's retainer and any fiduciary duty he owed to Mrs Marshall (and Kim Marshall), as well as relevant to the respective entitlements to the confidential information in the possession of Mr Prescott.
103I will address these latter issues but I do not accept that it is necessary for me to determine whether Ms Carruthers had a retainer with Kreindlers.  Kreindlers' retainer was governed by the law of New York (Fleming v Marshall [2011] NSWCA 86; 279 ALR 737 at [81] per Macfarlan JA, Spigelman CJ and Sackville AJA agreeing).  Both the ILF funding agreement executed by Ms Carruthers and Mr Goldberg's letter of 22 March 2002 appear to provide some support for the contention that Ms Carruthers retained Kreindlers, although it is not clear whether and, if so, when those documents were provided to Kreindlers.  Even if Ms Carruthers did not directly retain Kreindlers, then it may be that under the laws and customs regulating its conduct Kreindlers either owed her some form of duty or perhaps only a duty to Mrs Marshall not to allow her to be placed at risk of breaching any fiduciary duty she might owe to someone such as Ms Carruthers, notwithstanding Mr Goldberg's offensive letters demanding that it forward the money unconditionally.
104For present purposes it is only necessary for the Court to address what Kreindlers appears to have regarded as its obligations which I do below at [209]ff.  Otherwise I have already addressed at [31] the significance of the letter of 22 March 2002 which passed between Mr Goldberg and Mr Prescott.  It is further considered below (at  [118]).  What is critical to determining this case is what were the arrangements between Mrs Marshall and Mr Goldberg on the one hand and Mr Prescott and Ms Carruthers on the other.  Ultimately it was Mr Prescott's retainer and duty that were at issue in this proceedings, not Kreindlers'.
105A second and related issue was whether the complaint filed in the Pennsylvania proceedings meant that the proceedings were filed on behalf of Ms Carruthers.  In cross examination Mr Goldberg was asked and answered as follows:
""Q.  You understood that the effect of the words in your letter of 22 March 2002 where you said, 'This agreement is signed on behalf of Kim Marshall and Linda Carruthers', was that a retainer ... being effected with Kreindler and Kreindler by Margaret Marshall on behalf of Linda Carruthers, correct? A.  Yes, I think so."" 
106However Mr Goldberg said that he came to the belief that this view was wrong because ""[i]t became apparent after the complaint was filed that I may well have been wrong and I spent quite a bit of time after that sorting that out"".  This appears to be a reference to the terms of complaint subsequently filed in Pennsylvania.  As best as I can ascertain Mr Goldberg asserted that he construed the complaint as not embracing Ms Carruthers as a potential claimant.  It was suggested to Mr Goldberg in cross examination that this was a contrivance that he made up a number of years later.  I do not consider it necessary to determine whether he did genuinely form this opinion during the period 2002 to 2003, although I note that at no point prior to his letter of 8 April 2003 did he take up this particular aspect of his concerns about the complaint with Mr Green or explain to anyone that he provided his letter of 22 March 2002 because he had in some way been misled.
107As the emphasised portions from the court process filed in the Pennsylvanian proceedings make clear (see [33]), on its face the pleaded claim was certainly capable of including Ms Carruthers.  Prima facie she falls with the descriptions  ""surviving family member"", ""the decedent's survivors"" and ""next of kin"".  The subsequent advice obtained from Ms Evans rejects this.  I find that opinion unconvincing as it uses the interpretation rules appropriate for wills whereas the complaint is a  pleading.  In any event this is all irrelevant.  The advices that Mr Green provided to Mr Goldberg during 2002 and 2003 make it clear that he considered it at least arguable that Ms Carruthers may have had some entitlement.  The terms of the complaint did not appear and would not have appeared to him (or Mr Prescott) to be inconsistent with Ms Carruthers ultimately recovering.  Mr Green, however, made it clear that he would not enter the fray on that issue, but instead only saw his firm's role as being to maximise the amount recovered.
The fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott to the plaintiffs
108Before addressing the pleaded case, it is necessary to address three related topics, namely:  (i) the duration and scope of any fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott to Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall;  (ii) the effect of any estoppels created by the Consent Orders;  and (iii) the allegation that Mr Prescott breached an obligation of confidence after the termination of his retainer.
109What was the duration of any fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott to Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall?  The Consent Declaration records that the period of Mr Prescott's retainer to act on behalf of Mrs Marshall was from ""on or about 29 May 2001 until about 23 May 2003"".  As noted it was common ground that it was terminated by Mr Goldberg's letter to Mr Prescott of 23 May 2003.  The authorities binding on this Court at first instance are clear in holding that the ""fiduciary relationship which subsists between solicitor and client comes to an end with the termination of the retainer"" (Prince Jefri Bolkiah v KPMG (a Firm) [1999] 2 WLR 215 at 225 per Lord Millet;  Beach Petroleum NL v Abbott Tout Russell Kennedy [1999] NSWCA 408; 48 NSWLR 1 at [205]).  Further, any contractual duty of loyalty also comes to an end at that point (Kallinicos v Hunt [2005] NSWSC 1181; 64 NSWLR 561 at [76]).  Ultimately in the plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 (at [47]) Counsel for the Marshalls, Mr Bevan, conceded that this was the effect of the authorities, although he sought to preserve his clients' position by formally submitting that they were wrongly decided in this respect.
110This conclusion has a significant impact on Mrs Marshall's case.  I address the specific allegations made in the FASOC against Mr Prescott below.  As will become clear, a significant number of them are predicated on the existence of an ongoing duty of loyalty by Mr Prescott in the period after the termination of his retainer.  As a consequence they must be rejected.
111However the authorities also recognise that ""after termination or conclusion of a retainer, [a solicitor] has an ongoing duty to preserve the confidentiality of confidential information disclosed by a former client"" (Cooper v Winter [2013] NSWCA 261 at [97]; Kallinicos at [76]).  Ultimately Mr Bevan's submissions concerning Mr Prescott's conduct after 23 May 2003 were principally directed to establishing that he breached this obligation.  I address the suggested misuse of confidential information by Mr Prescott below. 
112What was the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott to Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall during the period of his retainer?  In the defendant's submissions dated 15 August 2013, counsel for Mr Prescott, Mr J.C. Kelly SC, identified the following passage from Beach Petroleum as having particular significance:
""[188]  Even in the case of a solicitor client relationship, long accepted as a status based fiduciary relationship, the duty is not derived from the status. As in all such cases, the duty is derived from what the solicitor undertakes, or is deemed to have undertaken, to do in the particular circumstances. Not every aspect of a solicitor client relationship is fiduciary. Conduct which may fall within the fiduciary component of the relationship of solicitor and client in one case, may not fall within the fiduciary component in another.
[189]  The relationship of solicitor and client has at its core an element of confidence and influence which equity will preserve and protect. Nevertheless, the confidence and influence are not always so pervasive as to require equitable intervention in every facet of the relationship.
[190]  The primary thrust of Beach's submissions was to challenge the conclusions of Rolfe J that there was no relevant retainer and hence no conflict between the duty ATRK owed to Beach and the duty they owed to other companies in the group which retained them in all or any of the relevant transactions. In so far as this Court accepts that any retainer was broader than that found by his Honour, it will be necessary for this Court to identify the scope of the retainer in order to determine the scope of the fiduciary duty.
...
[194]  The existence and scope of the duty may derive from a course of dealing. In a passage frequently cited with approval from Birtchnell v The Equity Trustees, Executors and Agency Co Ltd [1929] HCA 24; (1929) 42 CLR 384, a partnership dispute, Dixon J, as his Honour then was, said at 408:
'The subject matter over which the fiduciary obligations extend is determined by the character of the venture or undertaking for which partnership exists; and this is to be ascertained, not merely from the express agreement of the parties, whether embodied in written instruments or not, but also from the course of dealing actually pursued by the firm.'""(emphasis added)
113The above passages from Beach Petroleum warrant a consideration of the ""course of dealing"" in the period around the time of his retention between Mr Prescott and Mrs Marshall and Mr Goldberg in acting on her behalf and on behalf of Kim Marshall to determine the scope of the fiduciary duty.  Mr Bevan pointed to the terms of the Consent Declaration as exhaustively defining the scope of Mr Prescott's retainer and any fiduciary duty he owed.  While I accept that it is necessary to consider the Consent Declaration closely and not proceed inconsistently with it, as I will explain, it does not purport to exhaustively describe Mr Prescott's retainer, and it is not determinative of the scope and content of any fiduciary duty he owed.
114The first three sub-paragraphs of the Consent Declaration record ""for"" whom Mr Prescott acted, namely Mrs Marshall in her own right, or as executrix of the estate, Mrs Marshall on behalf of her son and Kim Marshall.  Subparagraphs (d) to (g) then specify the matters in respect of which Mr Prescott was retained, namely ""in  the investigation of"" Mrs Marshall's and Kim Marshall's legal rights arising out of the ""Whyalla Airlines plane crash investigation"", and ""in relation to the conduct"" of ""the Pennsylvania proceedings"", the ""Coroner's Court proceedings"" and the ""South Australian proceedings"". 
115Nowhere in the Consent Declaration is it stated that Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall were the only persons who retained Mr Prescott in relation to the subject matters listed in subparagraphs (d) to (g).  Thus a consideration of the circumstance known to all that Mr Prescott was also retained by Ms Carruthers in relation to at least the subject matter listed in subparagraph (e) is not precluded by the terms of the Consent Declaration.
116In the plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 Mr Bevan contended that the Consent Declaration records that Mr Prescott was retained to, inter alia, ""conduct"" the Pennsylvania proceedings (at [65]).  This misstates the declaration. As noted it only refers to him being retained ""in relation to the conduct"" of the Pennsylvania proceedings.  In fact the declaration does not purport to specify precisely what Mr Prescott ""under[took] or is deemed to have undertaken"" (Beach Petroleum at [188]) when retained ""in relation to the conduct of"" the proceedings nominated in subparagraphs (e) to (g).  Nor does it purport to state exhaustively what the ""course of dealing"" between Mr Prescott and his ""clients"" was in relation to those matters (Beach Petroleum at [194]).
117The defendant's written submissions dated 15 August 2013 pointed to a number of circumstances as bearing upon what Mr Prescott undertook and the relevant ""course of dealings"" (Beach Petroleum at [194]).  These were said to be significant to any assessment of the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott.
118The first has already been noted, namely that it was known by all that Mr Prescott was retained by Ms Carruthers.  Mr Prescott announced that he acted for Ms Carruthers at the outset in his first telephone call with Mrs Marshall (see [15]).  It was restated in his letter of 31 May 2001 (see [17]) and Mr Goldberg was clearly aware of that at the time he wrote his letter of 22 March 2002 to Mr Prescott (see [29]).  Ms Carruthers was the ""client"" of Mr Prescott that Mr Goldberg was referring to in his email of 29 July 2002 (see [38]).  Neither Mr Goldberg nor Mrs Marshall were ever advised that Mr Prescott had ceased to act for Ms Carruthers.  Further, in stating that he was acting for Ms Carruthers, Mr Prescott clearly identified her as a person who  wished to assert a claim or at least a potential claim for compensation in respect of Mr Marshall's death.  Any doubt about this was dispelled by his letter of 31 May 2001.
119Second, it was known that there was a history of litigious disputation between Ms Carruthers and Mrs Marshall.  Mr Goldberg referred to this in his email to Mr Green of 25 July 2002 (see [36]).
120Third, Mr Prescott's role vis-à-vis Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall ""in relation to the conduct"" of the various proceedings was restricted to a co-ordination and reporting role, bearing in mind that Mr Goldberg acted for them directly.  Thus for example in his letter of 14 June 2001 Mr Goldberg referred to Mr Prescott as the ""overall representative"" (see [18]). Mr Prescott's letters to the various legal representatives noted at [17] were consistent with that.  Mr Goldberg never sought Mr Prescott's advice on any matter specific to his clients' position in the same way that he directed requests to Mr Green at Kreindlers.
121Fourth, there were specific constraints placed on Mr Prescott's ""retainer"" for Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall.  In particular he was excluded from receiving personal information of theirs that might be relevant to any future disputation between Ms Carruthers and them.  This was the clear import of the agreement between Mr Goldberg and Mr Prescott about the means by which Mr Goldberg would communicate directly with Kreindlers, as referred to in Mr Goldberg's emails of 25 July 2002 and 29 July 2002 ([36] and [39]).
122As at 2001 to 2002 it was understood by all that Mr Prescott acted for Ms Carruthers and Mr Goldberg acted for Mrs Marshall and her son.   From the outset both Mr Prescott and Mr Goldberg were aware or should have been that, failing agreement, there was a strong likelihood that there would be disputation between their respective clients about the distribution of any proceeds of any judgment or settlement that might be obtained in the Pennsylvania proceedings.  However in the meantime there needed to be co-operation to pursue those proceedings to maximise the prospects of obtaining a recovery.  Mr Prescott accepted a limited a retainer on behalf of Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall to pursue the proceedings while still being retained by Ms Carruthers.
123To that end Mr Prescott was retained by Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall in the period from May 2001 to May 2003 ""in relation to the conduct"" of the four proceedings noted in subparagraphs (d) to (g) of the Consent Declaration.  However the retainer had significant qualifications bearing in mind that it was accepted and known to all that Mr Prescott was also retained by another person who would or at least might make a competing claim to theirs, namely Ms Carruthers.  Thus his role ""in relation to the conduct"" of those matters was restricted to a co-ordinating and reporting role and limitations were placed on the information that was imparted to him.
124I accept that Mr Prescott owed a fiduciary duty to Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall prior to the termination of his retainer but the scope of that duty was informed by the limited role that he assumed on their behalf.  In this limited role there was trust and confidence reposed in him.  Further this duty was qualified by the known circumstance that Mr Prescott acted for Ms Carruthers, who was, at the very least, a potentially competing claimant (see Kelly v Cooper [1993] AC 205).  In light of how the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty prior to the termination of Mr Prescott's retainer were pleaded it is not necessary to determine whether his duty precluded him from taking steps to preserve Ms Carruthers' position at a point where a conflict emerged between her and the Marshalls over their respective entitlement to share in the net proceeds of any settlement or judgment.
125A number of matters were submitted by Mr Bevan which were said to address both the scope of any fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott to the Marshalls and the allegations of breach of this duty.  I address the pleaded allegations of breach below.  However at this point I will address those aspects of these submissions which also appear to bear upon the scope of the duty.
126First, in the plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 and under the heading ""[n]ature of Mr Prescott's fiduciary duties"", Mr Bevan contended (at [49]), inter alia, that:
""When the retainer of Mr Prescott began in 2002 he believed that that [sic] the plaintiffs and Carruthers alike would be entitled to share any damages recovered in the US (although, at that stage, Pennsylvania had not yet been chosen as the appropriate forum in the US).  He so advised Mr Goldberg and Mrs Marshall relied on that advice in believing that she was suing for the joint benefit of herself, Kim Marshall and Carruthers.""  (emphasis added)
127The footnotes to the first passage do not provide any evidentiary reference that is capable of supporting the contention that Mr Prescott ""so advised"" Mr Goldberg.  Otherwise the significance of this submission to ascertaining the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott is not made clear in the balance of the submissions.  However it replicates a theme of Mr Bevan's submissions that the conduct of Mr Prescott somehow falsely induced Mr Goldberg to respond as he did in his letter of 22 March 2002.  In a similar vein, in one of his affidavits Mr Goldberg stated he replied in the terms he did in his letter of 22 March 2002 because he believed at that time that Mr Prescott had ""obtained reliable advice from [Kreindlers] about the status of [Mrs Marshall] as the claimant (plaintiff) in the Pennsylvania proceedings as representativ[e] of other persons"".  He added that his ""discovery of the true position ... occurred long after I had placed this implicit reliance on [Mr Prescott]"".  I admitted this evidence but restricted its use under s 136 of the Evidence Act 1995 to only proving Mr Goldberg's state of mind.  In the end result, there was nothing in the materials that was capable of supporting Mr Goldberg's assertion that Mr Prescott expressly or implicitly suggested he had such advice.
128Second, the plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 contended that the exchange of emails that occurred about the retainer on 20 and 22 March 2002 merely represented an exchange over a procedural matter (at [61]).  Mr Bevan submitted it was not capable of supporting a conclusion that there was any ""informed consent [on the part Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall] to a conflict of interest"" on the part of Mr Prescott in holding two retainers.  Against this (at [52]) were the contentions asserting it was common ground that Ms Carruthers had no interest in Mr Marshall's estate under Australian law, and pointing to Mr Prescott's statement in his email of 20 March 2002 that the estate representative should sign ""on behalf of all plaintiffs [claiming under a deceased] even if they did not have any entitlement under the will or the Act"".  These contentions are difficult to reconcile with the submission noted above and Mr Goldberg's evidence that Kreindlers' retainer was signed by Mrs Marshall based on some false belief induced by Mr Prescott that Ms Carruthers had a substantive claim. In any event both sets of contentions are irrelevant.
129In Beach Petroleum at [466] the Court of Appeal approved the following passage from the judgment of Millet LJ in Bristol & West Building Society v Mothew [1998] Ch 1 at 18 to 19:
""A fiduciary who acts for two principals with potentially conflicting interests without the informed consent of both is in breach of the obligation of undivided loyalty; he puts himself in a position where his duty to one principal may conflict with his duty to the other: see Clark Boyce v Mouat [1994] 1 AC 428 and the cases there cited. This is sometimes described as 'the double employment rule'. Breach of the rule automatically constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty. But this is not something of which the society can complain. It knew that the defendant was acting for the purchasers when it instructed him. Indeed, that was the very reason why it chose the defendant to act for it. The potential conflict was of the society's own making: see Finn, Fiduciary Obligations, p254 and Kelly v Cooper [1993] AC 205.
It was submitted on behalf of the society that this is irrelevant because the defendant misled the society. It did not know of the arrangements which the purchasers had made with their bank, and so could not be said to be 'fully informed' for the purpose of absolving the defendant from the operation of the double employment rule. The submission is misconceived. The society knew all the facts relevant to its choice of solicitor. Its decision to forward the cheque for the mortgage advance to the defendant and to instruct him to proceed was based on false information, but its earlier decision to employ the defendant despite the potentially conflicting interest of his other clients was a fully informed decision.""  (emphasis added)
130Thus in Beach Petroleum the Court concluded (at [467]):
""So too here. Beach, through its directors, knew that ATRK were acting for other companies within the group on the various transactions. Indeed, they had quite deliberately given instructions on behalf of those other companies to ATRK. If there was any conflict, it was of their own making and a decision which was made by them with knowledge of all the facts relevant to the choice of solicitor. It was a fully informed decision.""
131From the outset Mrs Marshall and Mr Goldberg knew that Mr Prescott acted for Ms Carruthers.  They knew that Ms Carruthers was claiming to be entitled to recover compensation in respect of the death of Mr Marshall via the Pennsylvania proceedings, and they knew that there was a significant potential or even likelihood that any claim she might make would be on the estate or would otherwise compete with their own interests.  To protect against this they put in place the arrangements that Mr Goldberg referred to in his emails of 25 and 29 July 2002.   Yet they had good reason to join with her in the interim to maximise the recovery of funds in respect of Mr Marshall's death.  To paraphrase Millet LJ  in Bristol & West Building Society, they knew all the facts relevant to their choice to retain Mr Prescott.
132Third, a related and more confusing contention made on behalf of the plaintiffs is that the contention that the fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott was qualified in the way that I have found ""fails to address the doctrinal effect of the Marshalls' belated discovery in late March/early April 2003 that their interests and those of Carruthers never were coincident because Mr Goldberg realised that Carruthers probably had no 'potential' US rights at all"" (plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 at [62]).
133The above analysis does not address this alleged ""doctrinal effect"" because there was none.  The finding I have made addressed the position in the period 2001 to 2002 when Mr Prescott's retainer was formed.  Mr Goldberg may have formed the conclusion that Ms Carruthers did not have a genuine claim in early 2003 but that is irrelevant.  Until that point the parties had conducted the matter on the basis that she may have a claim but that issue would only be determined if and when it was known that there was something to claim upon in the form of a judgment or settlement.  As either actual or potential claimants and regardless of their feelings for each other or the respective strengths of their competing claims, all of Mrs Marshall, Kim Marshall and Ms Carruthers had a common interest in maximising the amount recovered in respect of the death of Mr Marshall.  It was that common objective that Mr Prescott and Mr Goldberg agreed to co-operate to pursue.  Otherwise, there is no basis in the evidence for concluding that Mr Prescott and Mr Green acted upon any basis other than it was reasonably arguable that Ms Carruthers had a genuine claim.
Res judicata and issue estoppels relied on by the plaintiffs
134The Marshalls' submissions contended that the Consent Orders and Interlocutory Orders invoke the principle of res judicata in a manner that is of assistance to them.  They otherwise seek to seek to isolate and rely upon various issue estoppels that are said to arise out of Consent Orders and Interlocutory Orders.  To the extent that these submissions address the effect of the Consent Declaration, I have already addressed its effect.  Otherwise I note that no issue was taken on behalf of Mr Prescott that Kim Marshall was not a party to the proceedings that led to those orders.  (Presumably this was so on the basis that he in effect claims through Mrs Marshall.)
135The principle of res judicata is of no assistance to the Marshalls.  This principle operates so that ""where an action has been brought and judgment has been entered in that action, no other proceedings can thereafter be maintained on the same cause of action"" (Jackson v Goldsmith (1950) 81 CLR 446 and 466 per Fullagar J;  Port of Melbourne Authority v Anshun Pty Ltd [1981] HCA 45; 147 CLR 589 at 597).  A judgment or order by consent is a res judicata (Chamberlain v Deputy Commissioner of Taxation [1988] HCA 21; 164 CLR 502 at 508, Isaacs v Ocean Accident & Guarantee Corporation Ltd (1958) SR (NSW) 69 at 75 per Street CJ and Roper CJ in Eq;  Nau v Kemp & Associates Pty Ltd [2010] NSWCA 164; 77 NSWLR 687 per McColl JA at [64]).  It is as effective as one pronounced after a hearing in merging the cause of action sued on in the judgment.  However the fact that ""a judgment is entered by consent may on occasion make it hard to say what was necessarily decided by the judgment"" (Chamberlain at 508). Thus in this case it is not possible to conclude that anything was necessarily decided by the Consent Orders other than existence of the retainer, which has already been addressed.  Orders 2 and 3 of the Consent Orders resolved the entitlement of Mrs Marshall to obtain injunctive relief in respect of apprehended future conduct of Mr Prescott. That is completely different to the causes of action sued upon in these proceedings.
136The Marshalls' reliance on the doctrine of issue estoppel does not assist them either.  Whereas the rule as to res judicata is engaged whenever a party attempts to litigate a cause of action sued on in earlier proceedings that has merged into a judgment, issue estoppel arises where a party sues on some other cause of action but alleges or denies the existence of a matter necessarily decided by the prior judgment or order (Anshun at 597, citing Blair v Curran (1939) 62 CLR 464 at 532). Although a judgment or order by consent may give rise to issue estoppels, the question of the extent to which it may do so is not settled (K.R. Handley, Spencer Bower and Handley: Res Judicata, 4th Ed (2009) at p 20).  As Street CJ and Roper CJ in Eq stated in Isaacs, ""[i]t is clear that the mere fact that the judgment is by consent does not detract from its conclusive effect upon the issues determined by it"" (at 75).  A judgment, whether by consent or not, operates by way of estoppel only in relation to those matters which are necessarily decided by it (id).  The observation in Chamberlain (at 508) noted above as to the difficulty in determining what Consent Orders have decided applies equally to issue estoppel as it does to res judicata.
137To determine what issues a judgment has necessarily decided and whether any issue estoppel arises, the court will ""closely examine all such evidence, if any, as is available and admissible, and, by the aid of such materials, will ascertain whether any and what adjudication of matters in dispute was expressed, or necessarily involved, in the actual decision assented to"" (Isaacs at 75, cited in Nau v Kemp at [65] per McColl JA; Rogers v R  [1994] HCA 42; 181 CLR 251 at 263 per Brennan J).  This will involve a consideration of the record of proceedings, including any terms of settlement (Isaacs at 75; Glazier v Australian Men's Health (No 2) [2001] NSWSC 6 at [73] per Austin J, reversed on other grounds in Meehan v Glazier Holdings Pty Ltd [2002] NSWCA 22; 54 NSWLR 146). However, in circumstances where neither the record nor any other objective background material sheds further light on the matters in dispute, ""[i]t is not appropriate to look behind the orders and construct a chain of implied consents to various parts of [the other party's case]"" (Glazier at [73]).
138With orders 2 and 3 of the Consent Orders, nothing in the materials extraneous to the orders provides any assistance in determining whether any issue of fact or law helpful to the Marshalls was necessarily determined by those orders.  It was contended that the restraints imposed by the injunctions that form part of the Consent Orders recognise ""the [continuing] fiduciary nature of Mr Prescott's duties to [Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall]"" (plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 at [70]).  I reject this contention.  In Kallinicos (at 581 to 582) Brereton J explained that the jurisdiction to restrain a solicitor acting against a former client is not based on the existence of any continuing duty of loyalty but can be invoked either because of a threatened breach of the ongoing obligation to respect confidential information or because the overall ""interests of justice"" require it (or both).   It follows that I do not accept that the Consent Orders create an issue estoppel to the effect that there is any ongoing fiduciary duty as they were capable of being justified on the bases identified by Brereton J.
139Similarly it was contended that orders 2(a) to (d) in the Consent Orders create an issue estoppel to the effect that Mr Prescott was ""in breach of his post-retainer fiduciary duty to maintain the confidence in the confidential information of Mrs Marshall which came into his possession during the conduct of the Pennsylvania proceeding"" (plaintiffs' written submissions in reply dated 19 August 2013 at [23]).  I reject this contention. An injunction may issue even if there is only demonstrated a ""real and sensible possibility"" of the misuse of confidential information (Worth Recycling Pty Ltd v Waste Recycling & Processing Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 354 at [42] per Hodgson JA, with whom Spigelman CJ and Campbell JA agreed).  It follows that the granting of such an injunction does not of itself establish that there has been a breach of the obligation of confidence.  In fact the orders do not even assist in resolving whether there was such an obligation much less what the scope of that obligation was.  Order 2(c) merely referred to ""any confidential communications"" and 2(d) referred to ""any obligation of confidence"".
140Further, even if the Consent Orders necessarily decided that Mr Prescott had breached his obligation of confidence to Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall, then it would not assist them.  In that event there would still be no means by which the Court could be satisfied that such a breach was the same as one or more of the breaches of confidence pleaded in the FASOC.
141Finally, the suggestion that the interlocutory orders gave rise to a res judicata or issue estoppel is without substance.  Only a final order can have that effect (Maurice Blackburn Cashman v Brown [2011] HCA 22; 242 CLR 647 at [40];  Kuligowski v Metrobus [2004] HCA 34; 220 CLR 363 at 371).
Breach of Confidence
142As noted, the Marshalls allege Mr Prescott misused confidential information when he acted for and then later assisted Ms Carruthers in the Marshall proceedings. Although at this point I address the parties' respective submissions concerning the identification and alleged misuse of the relevant confidential material, later in the judgment I will address the pleaded allegations of a breach by Mr Prescott of his ongoing duty of confidence.
Background
143As hinted at earlier, the complaint that, after the termination of his retainer by Mrs Marshall and throughout the period he was acting for and then assisting Ms Carruthers in the Marshall proceedings, Mr Prescott thereby breached an equitable duty of confidence he owed to the Marshalls assumed greater importance with each iteration of the written submissions. In the plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 it was only mentioned as an adjunct to the assertion that he owed a fiduciary duty after the termination of his retainer (see for example [70]).  There was no attempt to identify or define the ""confidential information"" he was said to possess.
144In the defendant's written submissions dated 15 August 2013, Mr Kelly SC submitted (at [64]) that, consistent with the above authorities, after Mr Prescott's retainer terminated his only surviving duty, fiduciary or otherwise, was to ""preserve the confidentiality of information imparted during its subsistence"".  He further submitted that obligation was in this case robbed of any content because all that information was the ""joint confidential information"" of both the Marshalls and Ms Carruthers.  Mr Kelly SC identified instances of such information that may have been or were imparted to Mr Prescott as information concerning ""the potential settlement sum"", the ""quality of the evidence"", and the ""risks associated with the forum non [conveniens] application"".
145In the plaintiffs' written submissions in reply dated 19 August 2013 there was a limited attempt to define the confidential information.  At paragraph 30 Mr Bevan responded to Mr Kelly SC's contention that information was jointly owned by asserting that ""[a]ll the confidential information arising from the Pennsylvania proceedings"" was exclusively that of Mrs Marshall. However the only indication as to what that confidential information might be was in footnote 46 to those submissions which stated that the ""confidential information is either referred to in, or located at"".  Thereafter he set out approximately seventeen references to the pages of the tender bundle but not their content.
146The application to amend that I determined in Marshall (No 2) then intervened.  After publishing that judgment submissions were filed on behalf of Mr Prescott by junior counsel, Mr McManus, on 23 September 2013 which addressed each of the documents identified in footnote 46. 
147The last word on the topic was in the plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013.  In those submissions Mr Bevan contended for the first time that ""all information coming into the hands of Mr Prescott between the start of his retainer ... until its termination ... was confidential to Mrs Marshall ... and Kim [Marshall] ... only"" (at [35]).  (The plaintiffs' written submissions in reply dated 19 August 2013 had only referred to ""all the confidential information arising from the Pennsylvania proceedings"", which only begged the question as to what that was.)  Having made that submission the plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 also contended:
""""The suggestion that the plaintiffs have not demonstrated what the confidential information was or how it was misused ... is incorrect ... For the sake of completeness, and to remove any doubt about the issue, the information in question, its confidential nature, grounds for its confidential quality, and its sources are summarised in the tabular schedule which is annexure A to this outline for ease of reference (Schedule A).""
148Schedule A lists eight documents, six of which are letters from Mr Prescott. They represent a subset of the documents listed in footnote 46 of the plaintiffs' written submissions in reply dated 19 August 2013.  As I understand this submission these documents are said to identify the confidential information but are not meant to be an exhaustive statement of the occasions on which it was said to be disclosed.  Instead, as I understood the submission, it was contended that this was information that Mr Prescott possessed and which after his retainer from the Marshalls was terminated he brought to bear in acting and then later assisting Ms Carruthers.
149However this still leaves the apparent inconsistency in the two means by which the confidential information was identified in the plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 noted at [147].  I will treat them as alternative formulations.
Principles
150In Coco v AN Clark (Engineers) Ltd [1969] RPC 41 at 47, Megarry J specified the following conditions for the existence of an action for breach of an equitable obligation of confidence arising independent of contract:
""First, the information itself ... must 'have the necessary quality of confidence about it.' Secondly, that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence. Thirdly, there must be an unauthorised use of that information to the detriment of the party communicating it.""
151This formulation was adopted by Mason J in Commonwealth v John Fairfax & Sons Ltd (1980) 147 CLR 39 at 51, and Gleeson CJ in Australian Broadcasting Corporation v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 63; 208 CLR 199 at [30].  It was adopted by Barrett JA (with whom Meagher and Ward JJA agreed) in Streetscape Projects (Australia) Pty Ltd v City of Sydney [2013] NSWCA 2; 295 ALR 760 at [157]  and is binding on me, subject to the qualification that it is uncertain whether proof of detriment is an element of the cause of action (see Del Casale v Artedomus (Aust) Pty Ltd [2007] NSWCA 172 at [105] per Campbell JA, with whom McColl JA agreed, and the cases cited therein; and Smith Kline & French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Secretary, Department of Community Services and Health (1990) 22 FCR 73 (""Smith Kline & French (No 1)"") at 112 per Gummow J).
152In Streetscape at [158] Barrett JA noted that two propositions were implicit in these conditions, namely that the ""particular information is specifically identified"" and the ""confidential nature of the identified information is established"".  In respect of the former ""[p]recise delineation is necessary"" (at [159];  see also Smith Kline & French (No 1) at 87 and O'Brien v Komesaroff [1982] HCA 33; 150 CLR 310 at 327 to 328 per Mason J, with whom the other members of the Court agreed).  Otherwise Streetscape treated these conditions as also governing the elements that must be shown to obtain equitable damages for breach of confidence.
153In relation to the first requirement noted in [150], information has been said to have the ""necessary quality of confidence"" where it is not ""public property and public knowledge"" or, if it has been ""constructed solely from materials in the public domain"", in circumstances where the ""skill and ingenuity of the human brain"" have been applied (Del Casale at [103], citing Coco at 47).
154In relation to the second requirement, solicitors have a duty to keep the confidences of their clients (Baker v Campbell [1983] HCA 39; 153 CLR 52 at 65).  This obligation extends to any confidential information obtained during the period of the retainer relating to the client's affairs, whether this information is obtained directly from the client or from third parties (Gurry on Breach of Confidence, 2nd Ed (2012) at p 400).
155With the third element, it is important to note that it does not involve a strict prohibition on disclosure but instead a restriction on the ""misuse"" of the information. Thus in Smith Kline & French Laboratories (Aust) Ltd v Secretary, Department of Community Services & Health (1991) 28 FCR 291 (""Smith Kline & French (No 2)"") at 304 the Full Court of the Federal Court stated:
""To avoid taking unfair advantage of information does not necessarily mean that the confidee must not use it except for the confider's limited purpose. Whether one adopts the 'reasonable man' test suggested by Megarry J (in Coco v A.N.  Clark] or some other, there can be no breach of the equitable obligation unless the court concludes that a confidence reposed has been abused, that unconscientious use has been made of the information.""
156Thus their Honours stated that at least in cases where the interests of the confider and confidee are ""quite different, and known to be so"" (at 303) then the confider's purpose of disclosure will not be determinative.
All the information obtained by Mr Prescott
157As noted, the wide formulation of the confidential information exclusive to Mrs Marshall said to have been possessed by Mr Prescott was that ""all information coming into the hands of Mr Prescott between the start of his retainer ... until its termination ... was confidential to Mrs Marshall ... and Kim [Marshall]"".  Given the manner in which their case was prepared, the Marshalls were effectively forced to adopt this formulation.   The difficulty for them in relying on a case that isolated particular items or categories of confidential information is that, even allowing for a potentially wider test of causation in equity than in common law, their evidence and submissions did not enable any assessment of how the alleged misuse of any particular item, or even limited category, of confidential information by Mr Prescott was productive of any loss or damage they claim to have suffered.
158The obvious problem with this wider formulation is that it clearly embraces information that was not confidential to anyone. Thus to the extent that Mr Prescott acquired any knowledge of, say, the law of Pennsylvania, then that knowledge was not confidential information (O'Brien v Komesaroff  at 327 per Mason J). Further, to the extent that it is said to embrace the personal background to the disputes between the Marshalls and Ms Carruthers including the terms of Mr Marshall's will, that was all extensively canvassed in the judgments of Macready AsJ and the Court of Appeal in the FPA proceedings and the proceedings in the Compensation Court.  Thus in the end result this wide formulation is ""so general that [I cannot be satisfied] ... that [this information] was ... imparted in circumstances which gave rise to an obligation of confidence and that it does not include material which is common knowledge"" (O'Brien v Komesaroff id).  For this reason the wider formulation of the confidential information said to have been misused by Mr Prescott should be rejected.  It simply fails to conform with the long established requirement for precision in its formulation.  I address the point made by Mr Kelly SC that the confidential information that was imparted to Mr Prescott was ""joint confidential information"" below at [164]ff.
159At this point it is appropriate to address Mr Bevan's submissions concerning the judgment of Gummow J in National Mutual Holdings Pty Ltd v Sentry Corporation (1989) 22 FCR 209.  The plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 rely almost exclusively upon that judgment and appear to seek to invoke it to support this wider formulation of the confidential information said to have been misused by Mr Prescott. Mr Bevan noted that in Sentry at 230 Gummow J referred to an article by Professor Finn which advocated either a rebuttable or irrebuttable presumption to the effect that ""a prior retainer has resulted in the acquisition by the lawyer of confidential information so that he cannot act in the same or in a substantially related matter for an interest adverse to his former client unless the former client consents or unless the Court is satisfied that no confidential communication of possible relevance to that matter were in fact made"".  Mr Bevan submitted that his Honour ""appears to have accepted that a rebuttable presumption arises in Australia to that effect"".  Thus Mr Bevan contended that Mr Prescott bore the onus of proving that the information was not confidential (plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 at [39]).
160These submissions are misconceived.  First Gummow J did not accept that Professor Finn definitively stated the applicable law in Australia.  In Sentry his Honour was dealing with an application to injunct a party from pursuing proceedings commenced in New York to restrain Australian based solicitors from acting for a client in litigation in Australia.  One contention made in support of allowing the proceedings to continue in New York was that the law of New York was more stringent in addressing the circumstances in which a court would restrain a client's former solicitor from acting for the client's opponent in litigation and thus if the client was restrained from pursuing the New York proceedings a legitimate advantage accruing to them would be lost (Sentry at 228).  Based on Professor Finn's article, which was said to be consistent with the position in New York, Gummow J only found that there was a ""real possibility"" that the law in Australia is ""no less stringent"" than what was said to be the law in New York (at 230).  Clearly this was not a finding that Professor Finn's view represented the law.  In any event, the suggestion that there is a shifting onus of proof has since been rejected (Worth Recycling at [42] per Hodgson JA, with whom Spigelman CJ and Campbell JA agreed).
161Second, both the analysis of Professor Finn and the judgment in Sentry proceeded on a basis, since invalidated in this State, that the former solicitor's fiduciary duty continued to subsist after the retainer was terminated (Sentry at 233).  Thus in Beach Petroleum at [205] the Court of Appeal cited a passage from Prince Jefri to the effect that the solicitor's fiduciary duty ceased on the termination of the retainer and then added ""(Compare National Mutual Holdings v Sentry Corporation (1989) 22 FCR 209)"".
162Third, Mr Bevan's reliance on Sentry overlooks the fact that his clients are not seeking an injunction against a former solicitor.  At [43] of the plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 Mr Bevan invoked Gummow J's discussion in Sentry of various cases which appear to establish a reasonably low threshold to obtain injunctive relief (such as Mills v Day Dawn Block Gold Mining Co Ltd (1882) 1 QLJ 62).  Mr Bevan appeared to suggest that a similar low threshold was applicable in this case.  The currently prevailing jurisprudential basis for injuncting a client's former solicitor from acting against them was stated by Brereton J in Kallinicos, which has already been noted.  However this is not an application for an injunction.  Instead the Marshalls seek damages for breach of an equitable obligation.  The Marshalls must prove each element of that claim which I have already identified.  In doing so the continuous stream of judicial statements requiring the identification of the relevant confidential information with particularity apply with full force.
Schedule A information
163Next it is necessary to address the particular items of information described in Schedule A and which are said to have the necessary quality of confidentiality. Before doing so it is appropriate to address Mr Kelly SC's submission that I have noted above (at [144]) to the effect that any confidential information imparted to Mr Prescott during the subsistence of his retainer was jointly owned by the Marshalls and Ms Carruthers.
164Critical to addressing this contention is to consider the circumstances in which any such information was imparted to or received by Mr Prescott. I have already discussed those circumstances in addressing the scope of the fiduciary duty owed by Mr Prescott during the course of his retainer by Mrs Marshall.  The critical matters to note are that (i) it was known and accepted by all that Mr Prescott also acted for Ms Carruthers; (ii) Ms Carruthers at the very least was a potential competing claimant upon any funds obtained as compensation in respect of Mr Marshall's death; (iii) Mr Prescott only undertook a co-ordinating and reporting role in respect of the Marshalls;  (iv) there were agreed restrictions excluding Mr Prescott from accessing communications from Mr Goldberg in which he may have imparted personal information of the Marshalls and sought advice on quantum (see [118] to [121]); and (v) these matters came about from dealings between Mr Prescott and a solicitor acting on behalf of Mrs Marshall (and Kim Marshall), namely Mr Goldberg. Mr Prescott's retainer from both the Marshalls and Ms Carruthers was directed to the common objective of maximising the amount recovered in respect of the death of Mr Marshall (see [122] and [133]).
165These considerations warrant a partial acceptance of Mr Kelly SC's submission. To the extent that Mr Prescott received information which reflected the common objective of his respective retainers then it was the information of both the Marshalls and Ms Carruthers.  The categories of information identified by Mr Kelly SC's submission are examples of this (see [144]).  In terms of the elements of an action for breach of confidence noted in [150] it means that any disclosure of these categories of information by him in the course of disputation between the Marshalls and Ms Carruthers did not represent a ""misuse"" of the information. It would not constitute the ""taking of [unfair] advantage"" (Smith Kline & French (No 2)) for him to deploy information that his client, Ms Carruthers, was entitled to use.  This is so either because it was her information which she was free to use as she wished or at the very least it was free to be used in a dispute between her and the Marshalls.  There was no suggestion that Mrs Marshall was not free to use whatever information she had obtained about the Pennsylvania proceedings in her case against Ms Carruthers.  If the material obtained by Mr Prescott was not common to both Mrs Marshall and Ms Carruthers then why have a separate agreement excluding Mr Prescott from receiving the correspondence between Kreindlers and Mr Goldberg concerning quantum?  The position would be different if Mr Prescott had disclosed this information to third parties (see Murray v Yorkshire Fund Managers Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 951 at 957).
166However, I cannot accept the entirety of Mr Kelly SC's submission principally because, consistent with the authorities, there must be a close consideration of the particular information in question.  One category of information that was exclusively confidential to Mrs Marshall was the communications that passed between Mr Goldberg and Kreindlers in respect of which it was agreed that Mr Prescott would be excluded from.  Ms Carruthers had no interest in that information.  If Mr Prescott came into possession of that information then it would be unfair for him to deploy that material on Ms Carruthers' behalf.
167Against that background it is necessary to consider the individual items in Schedule A.
168The first item in Schedule A was a letter that Mr Prescott sent to Mr Reiders on 8 June 2005 noted above at [82].  In the letter Mr Prescott stated that he had been referred to Mr Reiders by Mr Green.  He set out the background to the dispute.  He sought his assistance in ""clarifying the position under the relevant Court rules involving claims being made through a deceased person"" and asked five questions for which he sought Mr Reiders' response. 
169Schedule A asserts that the confidential nature of the information is the ""subject matter of the US proceedings, relationships between the parties, analysis of the competing claims on the Marshall estate funds [and the] terms of [the] will of Neil Marshall"". 
170The terms of Mr Marshall's will that are referred to in the letter are referred to in the Court of Appeal's judgment in the FPA proceedings (Marshall v Carruthers [2002] NSWCA 47 at [7]).  Mr Prescott's analysis of the claims derived from applying his understanding of the law to the facts as found is also not Mrs Marshall's information.  I infer that it was undertaken after his retainer from Mrs Marshall was terminated.  Certainly the contrary has not been shown. Otherwise to the extent that the letter recites aspects of the background to the dispute which had not been publicly disclosed, it was certainly not the exclusive confidential information of the Marshalls.  Its deployment on behalf of Ms Carruthers was not an unfair or unconscientious use.
171The second item listed in Schedule A was a letter from Mr Prescott to the GIO's solicitors, Turks Legal, dated 2 August 2005.  Mr Prescott referred to the time he had spent with counsel and Teece Hodgson & Ward addressing a request for particulars.  In relation to discovery Mr Prescott stated:
""I can foresee however that the pleadings will be resolved in the not too distant future and in particular once we have gained information in relation to US Law from the United States. The issue then of discovery becomes very important indeed and from the point of view of Mrs Carruthers and your client it is fundamental. There is no doubt, and David Greenwell despite his current illness, has confirmed that there is a lot of very powerful documentation located in the files of Kreindler & Kreindler. The issue is making sure we can get hold of that documentation in a very short time ...
I think it is hard to overstress the importance of ensuring that there is a thorough examination of their file and extraction of as many of the relevant documents as possible. This is because I am fully aware of the fact that there are is a great deal of correspondence ... between Turner Freeman and Kreindler & Kreindler. It is important to note that at all times Turner Freeman refused to allow the writer to have any involvement in the quantum aspects. I am equally aware that they wrote to Kreindler & Kreindler seeking full details as to how precisely ... American law worked in relation to the assessment of damages.  Equally I am aware that there is some correspondence  between them  in respect of a refusal of Turner Freeman to pay the funds to Ms Carruthers pursuant to their recommendations.""
172Schedule A asserts that this letter reveals that Mr Prescott had an ""[a]wareness of the contents of the Kreindler[s] file in respect of conduct of the Pennsylvania proceedings for the Marshalls"" and the ""application of US law on the assessment of damages to known facts of the Marshall estate"".  In relation to the latter aspect there is nothing in the letter that reveals he was in possession of knowledge of US law on the assessment of damages to known facts, but even if he was it would not be confidential.
173The position with the former is less clear. It is likely that Mr Prescott was frank in this letter.  It is highly improbable when he wrote it that he ever contemplated it would be the subject of external scrutiny by reason of the loss or waiver of legal professional privilege. Consistent with what was agreed between Mr Prescott and Mr Goldberg, this letter suggests that during the course of his retainer Mr Prescott did not receive copies of the correspondence passing between Mr Goldberg and Mr Green concerning quantum or the refusal of Kreindlers to unconditionally provide the settlement moneys as demanded by Mr Goldberg.  However he clearly became aware that there was such correspondence and of the topics which it covered, namely the details of US law and the stand off  over the disbursement of funds.
174Mr Bevan's submission on this topic amounts to a contention that knowledge of the fact that there was correspondence on the topic of entitlements under US law and disbursement of funds was confidential to Mrs Marshall to the exclusion of Ms Carruthers.  I do not agree.  Such knowledge is really no different to supposition from the accepted fact that Mr Prescott was during his retainer excluded from receiving that material and was aware of the demarcation.
175The third item is a letter from Mr Prescott to the GIO's solicitors dated 4 August 2005.  His letter recounts that he had contacted lawyers at Kreindlers but they (wisely) stated they would not assist with the provision of information  without authority from Mrs Marshall.  Schedule A describes the confidential nature of the information in this letter as being an ""[a]wareness of the contents of the Kreindler[s] file in respect of their conduct of the Pennsylvania proceeding[s] for the Marshalls"".  The letter does not reveal that.  At most it reveals an awareness that they had a file.  That was not confidential information and it was certainly not confidential to the exclusion of Ms Carruthers.
176The fourth item in Schedule A is a letter from Mr Prescott to Teece Hodgson & Ward dated 11 August 2005 which was copied to the GIO's solicitors.  Mr Prescott recounts a conversation with Mr Greenwell who was then in hospital.  Mr Prescott recorded:
""Of interest are his comments in relation to the documentation in the United States and, of course, I am referring to the Kriendler & Kriendler [sic] file.  Firstly he indicates that he is aware of the fact that there is correspondence between Kriendler & Kriendler [sic] and Turner Freeman which directly relates to the issue of the dispensation of the settlement funds.
From discussions that he has had with Mr Green it becomes clear that that correspondence was to the effect that the monies gained through the deceased Marshall did not flow from the information and dependency of Mrs Marshall except possibly to a very small degree.  As such they did not believe that the funds should be dispensed to Mrs Marshall but should have been dispensed in accordance with their entitlements.  It is evident that they did their very best to prevent the funds being moved to the Turner Freeman Trust Account as they felt there was a potential to deprive [Ms] Carruthers of her just entitlements.
Mr Greenwell also indicated that in his view and on the basis of his knowledge of Kriendler & Kriendler [sic] they are firstly not interested in our domestic dispute and, secondly, and as you would expect, do not have a great deal of understanding of the Australian legal system.""  (emphasis added)
177Schedule A describes the nature of the confidential information referred to in this letter as the ""[c]ontents of discussions with Justin Green; awareness of the contents of the Kreindler[s] file in respect of their conduct of the Pennsylvania proceeding[s] for the Marshalls; the manner of determination of the claim by [the] Marshalls and negotiation of its settlement with [Lycoming] and others in the US"".
178The latter aspects of this description are not touched upon in this letter, but the former are.  The letter confirms that, prior to speaking to Mr Greenwell, Mr Prescott was not aware of the contents of the correspondence between Mr Goldberg and Kreindlers.  However, Mr Greenwell appears to have been aware of the contents of the correspondence concerning the dispute over the dissemination of the settlement funds and passed that knowledge on to Mr Prescott.  The contents of that correspondence, which Mr Prescott was excluded from, were confidential to Mrs Marshall.
179Thus, prima facie, it appears that Mr Prescott has at this time acquired information which he knew or should have known was information that was exclusively confidential to Mrs Marshall, and then disclosed it to the GIO's solicitors and Teece Hodgson & Ward.  It appears to have been the very class of information which he was deliberately excluded from receiving.
180The fifth item is a letter from Mr Prescott to the GIO's solicitors dated 15 August 2005.  In the letter Mr Prescott comments on what appears to be a request for him to produce documents in response to a discovery request and inquires about being paid for providing ""assistance"".  In one part he states, inter alia, ""... I have already gained a disc dealing with the emails between Mr Greenwell and [Kreindlers].  I have to say that there are an awful lot of them and it will take some time to go through them"".
181Schedule A described the contents of the disc as containing ""all available confidential information relating to the conduct of the claim by the Marshall estate against [Lycoming] and others in Pennsylvania held in electronic format"".
182The disc was not tendered.  The only evidence of its contents is the description that it contains the emails between Mr Greenwell and Kreindlers.  I do not infer that it contained the letters passing between Mr Goldberg and Kreindlers.  I accept that it may contain information about the proceedings generally, but I am not able to be satisfied that, in receiving this disc, Mr Prescott acquired information that was confidential to Mrs Marshall to the exclusion of Ms Carruthers.
183The sixth item in Schedule A is a letter from Mr Prescott to Mr Greenwell dated 8 September 2005. Mr Prescott wrote to Mr Greenwell enclosing a draft affidavit for his consideration, the terms of which are unknown.  In one part of the letter he stated ""... I attach details of I Audio NP3/MPG Player that I referred to you when I visited you in the [hospital]"".
184Schedule A  asserts that the contents of the ""diskette"" as referred to in this extract from Mr Prescott's letter contain ""all available confidential information relating to the conduct of the claim by the Marshall estate against [Lycoming] and others in Pennsylvania held in electronic format"".
185There is no evidence that this letter refers to any diskette, if that is meant to be a different disc to the one referred to in the letter of 15 August 2005. The phrase ""I Audio NP3/MPG Player"" was not explained but it appears to be a reference to software designed to play audio or video files.  I am not satisfied that anything in this letter suggests or refers to some category of confidential information that Mr Prescott had acquired that was confidential to Mrs Marshall to the exclusion of Ms Carruthers.
186The seventh item in Schedule A was paragraphs 1 to 20 of the affidavit of Janette Kveytel sworn 31 October 2005.  Ms Kveytel was a solicitor employed by Teece Hodgson & Ward. She swore this affidavit in support of the notice of motion seeking an extension of time for Ms Carruthers to comply with the Court's timetable in the Marshall proceedings (see [87]).  Paragraphs 3 to 7 of the affidavit set out the background to the proceedings.  These are said to be based on information provided by Mr Prescott and Mr Greenwell.  Paragraphs 8 to 11 described various difficulties the deponent had encountered in obtaining assistance from Mr Greenwell. Paragraph 12 recorded that Mr Prescott had undertaken to make contact with attorneys in the USA to obtain an opinion on the law of Pennsylvania. Paragraphs 13 to 20 annexed correspondence between Mr Prescott and Mr Reiders and other lawyers in the USA. 
187Schedule A describes the contents of this affidavit as being based on ""instructions provided by Mr Prescott to Ms Kveytel which recount the facts and circumstances of the Pennsylvania proceeding[s] and the importance of the requirement to obtain more information from Mr Prescott for the success of the Carruthers' claim"".  In essence this is a reference to the common background to the Pennsylvania proceedings.  I am not satisfied that anything in this part of the affidavit suggests or refers to some category of confidential information that Mr Prescott had acquired that was confidential to Mrs Marshall to the exclusion of Ms Carruthers.
188The eighth item in Schedule A  is a letter from Mr Goldberg to Mr Prescott dated 14 November 2005.  It was sent just prior to the return of the notice of motion that led to the making of the Interlocutory Orders on 16 November 2005 (see [90]).  It was sent in response to a letter from Mr Prescott also dated 14 November 2005.  In that letter Mr Prescott had debated various matters with Mr Goldberg.  He had referred to the execution of a funding agreement with ILF by Ms Carruthers and enclosed a letter from Mr Goldberg to Mr Bowman dated 10 April 2003.  In his response of the same day Mr Goldberg referred to three ILF funding agreements executed by his clients, namely two by Mrs Marshall and one by Kim Marshall (see [21] and [27]).  Mr Goldberg also complained about Mr Prescott being in possession of his letter to Mr Bowman.  One part of the plaintiffs' final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 contends that Mr Goldberg complained ""bitterly"" about the misuse of these agreements by Mr Prescott ([44(g)]).  Mr Goldberg made no such complaint.
189Schedule A asserts that the confidential information referred to in this exchange was the three ILF funding agreements executed by the Marshalls and the letter of 10 April 2003. 
190In relation to the ILF funding agreements, the submission is misconceived as there is not a hint of any use or deployment of them by Mr Prescott.  It is Mr Goldberg who refers to them not Mr Prescott.
191In relation to the letter that Mr Goldberg sent to Mr Bowman dated 10 April 2003, I infer that Mr Prescott obtained that letter from Mr Greenwell shortly after being served with the notice of motion seeking to restrain him from acting in the Prescott proceeding. If he had it earlier I expect he would have referred to it in the correspondence referred to above.  The sending of that letter back to Mr Goldberg was not an abuse of any confidence given that Mr Goldberg acted for Mrs Marshall and Mr Prescott was seeking to respond to allegations that had been made against him.
Conclusion 
192Except in one limited respect, I am satisfied that the Marshalls have failed to establish that Mr Prescott misused any of their confidential information.  The only limited respect concerns his conduct in receiving from Mr Greenwell and then passing onto Teece Hodgson & Ward the contents of the communications between Mr Goldberg and Kreindlers in early 2003 concerning the distribution of the proceeds of the settlement.  With respect to this conduct I am not prepared to make a definitive finding that this involved a misuse of the Marshalls' confidential information because, as explained at [233] to [235] below, such an allegation was not part of the pleaded case and in those circumstances it would be unfair to Mr Prescott to do so.
The pleaded case
193During the course of the hearing, it was submitted on behalf of Mr Prescott that the Marshalls' written and oral submissions made allegations that went outside the pleaded case in a number of respects.  Eventually this led to an application to further amend the statement of claim being made on behalf of the Marshalls after oral submissions had concluded.  I determined that application and only allowed some of the amendments sought.  I made orders allowing for further written submissions on certain limited issues (Marshall v Prescott (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1254).
194In Marshall v Prescott (No 2) at [22], I reiterated that this case would be determined on the pleadings.  While this is, or should be, axiomatic in any litigation, it is particularly apposite to this case involving as it does events that occurred a long time ago and the making of serious allegations.  To that end I will address the specific allegations made by the pleadings below.  To the extent that the submissions made on behalf of the Marshalls allege matters against Mr Prescott that are said to give rise to a liability on his part which are not pleaded, I will ignore them (see for example [59], [71], [73], [74], [75], [96] to [97] of the plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013).
195The structure of the FASOC was that at various points certain matters were defined as constituting some form of misconduct by Mr Prescott, eg the ""Prescott's first Marshall misconduct"". Each identified form of misconduct was later alleged to be actionable in various ways such as by a tortious conspiracy, a breach of a term of his retainer, a breach of the fiduciary duty it was said he owed to Mrs Marshall or the Marshalls, negligence, etc.  To address the pleaded case it is necessary for this judgment to adopt the same nomenclature but nevertheless I consider this to be a regrettable form of pleading.  It defines certain matters involving Mr Prescott as ""misconduct"" so that the suggestion he engaged in misconduct is assumed rather than justified. It means that a judgment such as this which is published and text searchable will have numerous references to Mr Prescott and ""misconduct"" even though I reject all of the pleaded causes of action against him.
196This problem with the FASOC is exemplified by [87] which pleads:
""It was necessary for [Mrs Marshall] to bring the Prescotts proceedings because of the need to ensure the success of the Carruthers proceedings for the benefit of the [Marshalls] to restrain Prescott from assisting Carruthers in her defence and cross-claim in the Carruthers proceedings to the detriment of the [Marshalls] (Prescotts' fourth Marshall misconduct).""  (emphasis in original)
197Another part of the pleading already accuses Mr Prescott of misconduct in assisting Ms Carruthers in her defence and cross claim.  Thus, properly analysed, this paragraph does not allege any ""conduct"" by Mr Prescott, much less anything that could amount to ""misconduct"" by him, yet the label ""Prescott's fourth Marshall misconduct"" remains.
The (so called) Prescott's First Marshall Misconduct
198The only sensible means of describing this allegation is to set out the relevant parts of the FASOC that describe the Prescott first Marshall misconduct in full:
""34.  On 25 April 2003, after receiving further notice of a claim on the net settlement amount by Carruthers from two sources, namely, from David Greenwell, and from Prescotts, Kreindler and Kreindler entered into a confidential understanding, arrangement or agreement with those legal representatives of Carruthers having the following terms:
(a) Kreindler and Kreindler promised to keep secret from the plaintiffs the fact of the making of the Carruthers' claim until Kreindler and Kreindler had procured the plaintiffs' execution of the release documents required by Lycoming on behalf of the Pennsylvania defendants as a term of payment of any gross settlement amount under the in-principle compromise to the plaintiffs;
(b) Kreindler and Kreindler also agreed to facilitate or otherwise assist Carruthers' legal representatives to make a claim on her behalf on the net settlement amount after it was paid to a third party stakeholder in Australia on behalf of the [Marshalls] and Carruthers by undertaking the conduct referred to in paragraph (a) above together with a process of advising Carruthers' legal representatives in Australia on the law in Pennsylvania under which the legal entitlement to damages for wrongful death and survival actions would be determined (the Kreindlers' confidential arrangement).
PARTICULARS...
35. When David Greenwell (Greenwell) made the Kreindlers' confidential arrangement he did so:
(a) on behalf of the defendant for the ultimate benefit of his other client, Carruthers;
(b) on instructions from, and as the duly authorised agent of, the defendant;
(c) in breach of the terms of the defendant's retainer from the plaintiff (both express and implied);
(d) in breach of the defendant's duty of care to the plaintiffs as their solicitor;
(e) in breach of the defendant's fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs as their solicitor.
36.  In making the Kreindlers' confidential arrangement through the agency of Greenwell the defendant committed a conspiracy with Kreindler and Kreindler to:
(a) commit an unlawful act or acts, being the various breaches of duty pleaded in the immediately preceding paragraph, with the intention of harming the plaintiff's legitimate financial interests;  or
(b) perform a lawful act or acts, being the various breaches of duty pleaded in the immediately preceding paragraph, which had the predominate purpose of harming the plaintiff's legitimate financial interests,
and in both cases that conduct caused the plaintiffs to suffer loss and damage (Prescott's conspiracy conduct).
37.  The making of the Kreindlers' confidential arrangement on 25 April 2003 constituted breaches of various duties owed by Prescott to the plaintiffs (Prescott's initial breaches of duty), in addition to the Prescotts conspiracy conduct, namely:
(a) a breach of the terms of the Prescotts retainer (express and implied);
(b) a breach of the duty of care owed by Prescott to the plaintiffs as their solicitor under his retainer;
(c) a breach of the fiduciary duty owed by Prescott to the plaintiffs as their attorneys under their retainer of him,
and Prescotts' [sic] initial breaches of duty and Prescotts' [sic] conspiracy conduct are collectively referred to as 'Prescott's first Marshall misconduct'.""  (emphasis in original)
199Paragraph 34 identifies certain conduct said to be the ""Kreindlers' confidential arrangement"".  It is not clear whether Mr Prescott is one of the ""legal representatives of Carruthers"" referred to.  Paragraph 36 alleges that the Kreindlers' confidential arrangement was made ""through the agency of Greenwell"".  The allegation that Mr Greenwell was Mr Prescott's ""agent"" was not elaborated upon other than the assertions in paragraph 35. The proposition that merely because Mr Prescott had briefed Mr Greenwell then any acts or knowledge of Mr Greenwell are imputed to Mr Prescott especially for the purpose of forming a tortious conspiracy is not one that I accept, although I will assume it in the Marshalls' favour.
200There are only three items of evidence that point to any possible conduct by Mr Prescott in the period embraced by this part of the pleading, whether undertaken via Mr Greenwell or in his own right.  The first is the email from Mr Greenwell to Mr Green of 13 April 2003 noted in [59] above.  The email confirms that Mr Prescott had provided Mr Greenwell with a copy of Mr Goldberg's letter of 22 March 2002.  I infer that he did so because he was aware that Mr Goldberg on behalf of Mr Marshall was seeking to have the entirety of the net proceeds of the settlement released to his clients to the exclusion of Ms Carruthers and, in doing so, was asserting that Kreindlers owed no duty to Ms Carruthers.  To that end Mr Prescott via Mr Greenwell was seeking to preserve Ms Carruthers' position. 
201The second potential item of evidence is the email from Mr Green to Mr Greenwell which was copied to Mr Bowman on 25 April 2013 (see [63]). There is no evidence that that email was sent to Mr Prescott and the exchanges in 2005 discussed above suggest it was not.  It refers to a lawyer in the United States having been contacted by ""the solicitor for Carruthers"" who ""wanted to know what could be done in the U.S. to prevent all of the Marshall settlement being paid to Mrs Marshall and Kim [Marshall]"".  It seems unlikely that the ""solicitor for Carruthers"" being referred to is Mr Prescott as Mr Green would simply refer to him by his name given that Messrs Green, Greenwell and Bowman all knew him.  It is more likely that that solicitor was someone from the firm Teece Hodgson & Ward, but I infer any contact by anyone from that firm was done with at least Mr Prescott's knowledge and most probably his encouragement.
202However there is no evidence that either Mr Greenwell or Mr Prescott joined in Mr Green's request to ""keep this confidential"" and I am certainly not satisfied that Mr Prescott did.  Not only is there is no evidence from which that could be inferred, there is a significant piece of evidence strongly suggesting against it, namely the third item of evidence which was the letter from Teece Hodgson & Ward to Kreindlers on 16 May 2003 requesting that it not disseminate the proceeds of the settlement to Mrs Marshall (see [68]).  Again I infer that this was sent with the knowledge of Mr Prescott and he would have been aware that it was likely to be passed onto Turner Freeman, as it duly was.
203One aspect of paragraph 34(a) of the FASOC is the assertion that somehow there was some secrecy about ""the fact of the making of the Carruthers' claim"" pending the execution of a release by Mrs Marshall (and the funds being secured).  This contention has no substance.  Mrs Marshall was not sent the Deed of Release until some time around 23 May 2003 but, as just noted, by 16 May 2003 Teece Hodgson & Ward had expressly stated that Ms Carruthers would make some form of claim on the settlement monies and this was passed onto Mr Goldberg.  Further, Mr Greenwell and Mr Prescott had informed Mr Allen from Turner Freeman's Adelaide office of that in late February 2003.  In cross examination Mr Goldberg accepted that he knew a claim was being asserted on Ms Carruthers' behalf although he did not consider it was genuine.
204In any event, as I have stated it should have been obvious to Mrs Marshall that Ms Carruthers was always a claimant or potential claimant on any funds obtained from the Pennsylvania proceedings.  Whether the claim would be against the fund directly or the estate is immaterial for present purposes.  From the very outset Mr Prescott stated that he acted for her.  Neither Mr Goldberg nor Mrs Marshall was ever advised to the contrary.  As stated, the background was that Mrs Marshall and Ms Carruthers had been making competing claims against each other in other litigation for a number of years.  Mr Goldberg either did know or should have known that, unless there was some agreement, Ms Carruthers was overwhelmingly likely to make a claim in some form.
205The events of February to May 2003 are not especially difficult to gauge at least so far as Mr Prescott is concerned.  It was clear to him and Mr Goldberg that he acted for Ms Carruthers and Mr Goldberg acted for Mrs Marshall and her son.  From the outset they were both aware or should have been that there was a strong likelihood that there would be disputation between the Marshalls and Ms Carruthers about the distribution of any proceeds from the Pennsylvania proceedings.  However in the meantime there needed to be some cooperation to pursue those proceedings to maximise the prospects of obtaining a recovery.  To that end Mr Prescott assumed an obligation to Mrs Marshall in relation to the pursuit of the proceedings while still being retained by Ms Carruthers.  In April 2003 Mr Goldberg made a pre-emptive strike.  In cross examination  he accepted that he sought to capture the whole of settlement and deprive Ms Carruthers of the entirety of it.  In response Mr Prescott sought to at least preserve Ms Carruthers' position by providing Mr Greenwell with the letter of 22 March 2002 and then either consented to or encouraged Teece Hodgson & Ward to write its e-mail of 16 May 2003.
206It follows that the factual allegation in subparagraph 34(a) of the FASOC completely fails.  I am not satisfied that Mr Prescott either in his own right or somehow via Mr Greenwell entered into an ""understanding, arrangement or agreement"" that involved Kreindlers (or anyone else) ""keep[ing]"" secret from Mrs Marshall the fact that Ms Carruthers was making any form of claim at any point, including prior to the execution of the release by Mrs Marshall.  There is no evidence to support that factual allegation and in fact the evidence is all to the contrary.  The fact that Ms Carruthers was or would make a claim was obvious or should have been to all involved from the outset.  In the events that happened Mrs Marshall via Mr Goldberg was advised of that fact well before his client was presented with a proposed release.  He was sent the file note of the meeting that occurred in late February 2003.  He received Kreindlers' email forwarding the email from Teece Hodgson & Ward.
207The factual allegation in subparagraph 34(b) of the FASOC is a difficult one to unpack. The paragraph opens with an allegation that Kreindlers entered into a ""confidential understanding, arrangement or agreement"" with the ""legal representatives of Carruthers"" pursuant to which Kreindlers agreed to facilitate the making of a claim on behalf of Ms Carruthers on moneys paid to a third party stakeholder by two methods.  The first was said to involve ""undertaking the conduct referred to in [34](a)"", an allegation that I have already rejected.  The second was said to involve a ""process of advising Carruthers' legal representatives in Australia on the law in Pennsylvania under which the legal entitlement to damages for wrongful death and survivors actions would be determined"".  I have searched in vain for any evidence that there was any agreement amongst the relevant players to undertake that step.  There is no such evidence.
208Mrs Marshall has failed to establish the factual allegations in [34] of the FASOC and that part of [36] that alleges Mr Prescott made the Kreindlers' confidential arrangement.
209To this point I have not considered the position of Kreindlers in this period as it is not the defendant.  Mr Prescott is.  However it is appropriate to record one finding I make concerning Kreindlers because of its significance to so much of the Marshalls' case as alleged that the conduct of Mr Prescott in this period was causative of the loss sought to be recovered.  In particular it was contended that, if it were not for Mr Prescott's conduct, Kreindlers would have paid over the net settlement proceeds to Turner Freeman without conditions.  In that event  it is said that the Marshall proceedings would not have been commenced (because there would not have been any undertaking given to Kreindlers to commence them).  The Marshalls further contended that, having lost in the Court of Appeal in the FPA proceedings, Ms Carruthers would not have commenced proceedings in her own right and thus Mrs Marshall would have avoided incurring the legal costs that she did in the Prescott proceedings and the Marshall proceedings.
210The difficulty with that contention is that I am satisfied that, irrespective of any intervention on the part of Mr Prescott (or Mr Greenwell), unless Ms Carruthers abandoned her claim entirely Kreindlers would either not have released the funds to Turner Freeman without the undertakings that it sought, or would have retained the funds itself.  Mr Goldberg launched his pre-emptive strike in his letter of 8 April 2003 (see above at [52]). Kreindlers' response was quick and emphatic.  Its letter was sent back the same day and concluded with the statement ""[u]nless an agreement can be reached, we will have to hold the settlement until a court of competent jurisdiction"" decided the issue (see [54]).  The only subsequent change from that  position was that it eventually released the funds subject to an undertaking they would not be distributed by Turner Freeman without an appropriate court order, and that proceedings of the kind it envisaged would be commenced.  In context that change was immaterial.
211The submissions lodged on behalf of the Marshalls contended that this was only a prima facie view and that it was Mr Prescott, either in his own right or via Mr Greenwell, who caused it to become a final one.  I reject this submission.  The argument in support of it was as follows (at [5] of the plaintiffs' written submissions in reply dated 19 August 2013):
""... the [Marshalls] contend that Mr Green never believed, on the available evidence, that Carruthers had any entitlement whatsoever under Pennsylvania law. He well knew her to be persona non grata under Pennsylvania law [footnote]. His acceptance of her potential entitlement to the fund was wholly based on what Mr Greenwell told him (on instructions from Mr Prescott) [footnote], which was that Ms Carruthers' rights (if any) arose under the law of Australia [footnote]. He readily accepted whatever Mr Greenwell told him.""
212The footnotes to this submission reveal that the  evidence that is said to support the assertion as to Mr Green's belief concerning Ms Carruthers' entitlement is Mr Bowman's handwritten file note which I have already addressed (at [65] to [66]).  The footnotes also reveal that the evidence that is said to support the contention that Mr Prescott via Mr Greenwell talked Mr Green into having the opinion attributed to him was the email of 13 April 2003 (see [59]).  The email of 13 April 2003 merely asserts that Mrs Marshall had a fiduciary duty in respect of Ms Carruthers because of the terms of the letter of 22 March 2002.  It is silent about Ms Carruthers' status as a de facto under Australian law and its interaction with the law of Pennsylvania.  Any opinion that Kreindlers formed about Ms Carruthers' status appears to have been based on its own assessment of the Court of Appeal's decision in the FPA proceedings. There is no evidence that it ever sought any opinion from Mr Prescott or Mr Greenwell on that issue.
213In a similar vein Mr Bevan also sought to argue that Mrs Marshall lost the ""opportunity"" to persuade Kreindlers to the contrary because of Mr Prescott's conduct.  I reject that contention also.  There was no lost opportunity to persuade Kreindlers because it was never going to change their mind.  The position stated by Kreindlers in its letter dated 8 April 2002 was completely consistent with its statements as to its understanding of its own role throughout 2002.  Thus in his letter of 1 August 2002 Mr Green stated that his firm would not involve itself in ""intra or inter-family disputes"" and the ""distribution of the monies is a separate issue"" to the role it assumed, namely ""maximis[ing] the recovery for each decedent's estate"" (see [42]).
214Kreindlers was said to be a firm experienced in the bringing of proceedings on behalf of multiple claimants arising out of the same event or events whether they be class actions or a collection of actions.  Mr Prescott's role so far as they were concerned was to coordinate the various claimants in Australia.  Kreindlers was in a position to and no doubt did make its own assessment of the appropriate course to adopt in response to Mr Goldberg's pre-emptive strike.  Mr Green's immediate response on 8 April 2003 to the suggestion that Kreindlers unconditionally release the funds to Turner Freeman and the subsequent resistance of Kreindlers was completely consistent with what it described as its role.  It reflected Kreindlers' assessment that Mrs Marshall and presumably it would be exposed if it agreed and it turned out that Ms Carruthers had a valid claim (either on the funds directly or through the estate).  Kreindlers' letters consistently reflected a belief on its part that Ms Carruthers had an arguable claim on any funds that might be recovered.
215Paragraph 36 of the FASOC alleges that Mr Prescott engaged in a conspiracy by unlawful means ([36(a)]) and lawful means ([36(b]).  This was expanded upon in [107] of the FASOC.  It follows from my rejection of the factual contentions that support those allegations that the conspiracy claim, at least so far as it involves the Prescotts first Marshall misconduct, is not made out.  Paragraph 37 of the FASOC alleges that the first Marshall misconduct constituted a breach of Mr Prescott's retainer, negligence and a breach of the fiduciary duty he owed Mrs Marshall.  Again these paragraphs were expanded upon at [103] to [106] of the FASOC.  Again, at least so far as they involve the Prescott's first Marshall misconduct, these paragraphs are not made out for the same reasons.  In relation to the allegation that he pursued a conspiracy by lawful means, it also fails because any conduct undertaken by Mr Prescott was for the advancement of the interests of Ms Carruthers (Crofter Handwoven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch [1942] AC 435).
216Further, the finding that I have made at [210] means that no damage was occasioned by any conduct undertaken by Mr Prescott prior to the termination of his retainer on 23 May 2003.  This suffices to deny causation both at common law and equity (Beach Petroleum at [449]).
217Finally I note that the question of whether or not the conduct of Mr Prescott in procuring the sending of the letter of 22 March 2002 to Mr Green on 13 April 2003 (see [200]) breached the fiduciary duty he owed to Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall was not one that was raised by the pleaded case and I have not addressed it. I rejected the Marshalls' attempt to amend to include a further claim against Mr Prescott based on this aspect of his conduct in Marshall (No 2) at [32] to [54] and [55] to [62].
The (so called) Prescott's first, second, third and fourth GIO misconduct (collectively the so-called Prescott's second Marshall misconduct)
218The next part of the FASOC defines various forms of conduct and events as follows:
""Prescott's first GIO misconduct
66.  On 17 July 2003, in the immediate aftermath of the giving of the [Marshalls] written undertaking and the commencement of the Carruthers proceeding in pursuance of that undertaking, the defendant commenced a course of conduct of procuring Carruthers to make a formal claim upon the net settlement amount and GIO Worker's Compensation (NSW) Limited ACN 0454 523 698 (GIO) to fund a defence and cross-claim in the Carruthers proceeding in the name of Carruthers for her own benefit as to part of the net settlement amount and as the nominee of GIO in order to recover an amount to enable GIO to reimburse itself for the $201,906 paid to Carruthers under a judgment given in her favour on 26 July 2001 in the Compensation Court of NSW as the dependent spouse of the deceased in respect of his worker's compensation death benefit entitlement (Prescott's first GIO misconduct).
PARTICULARS...
67.  On 15 October 2004 Carruthers filed a defence and cross-claim in the Carruthers proceeding on behalf of GIO as its nominee and at the expense of GIO in which she:
(a) denied that the [Marshalls] had any entitlement at all to the net settlement amount;
(b) asserted that she alone was entitled to the whole of the net settlement amount;
(c) claimed the payment of the net settlement amount to her beneficially;
(d) asserted that the net settlement amount was held on trust for her by Turner freeman and not for the plaintiffs;
(e) failed to identify whether her alleged right to the net settlement amount  arose under the law of New South Wales, the law of Pennsylvania or under the law of another jurisdiction (Carruthers defence and cross-claim);
(f) failed to disclose that she was acting as a defendant and cross-claimant [i]n the proceedings as the nominee of GIO
PARTICULARS...
...
71.  The entry of Carruthers into the GIO litigation funding agreement was made secretly, in that knowledge of it was withheld from the plaintiffs until discovery of documents was given to them in respect of the defendant's files and other records in 2006 in the Prescott proceedings pleaded in paragraph 82 below (Prescott's third GIO misconduct).
PARTICULARS...
71A.   On 9 June 2005 Carruthers and GIO entered into a final litigation funding agreement (the GIO final litigation funding agreement) for the defence and prosecution of a cross-claim in the Carruthers proceeding in consequence of steps taken by Prescott to procure Carruthers and the GIO to enter it (Prescott's fourth GIO misconduct).
PARTICULARS...""(emphasis in original)
219The definition of ""Prescott's third GIO misconduct"" suffers from the vice I have identified at [197], namely that it does not identify any conduct on the part of Prescott other than perhaps implicitly alleging that it was Mr Prescott who withheld knowledge of the funding agreement(s) with the GIO from Mrs Marshall's solicitor.  The definition of ""Prescott fourth GIO misconduct"" also suffers from the same problem.
220Leaving those matters aside, the factual contentions in these paragraphs  have mainly been established, although it is doubtful that Mr Prescott's conduct could be described as it is in [66] of the FASOC as ""procuring"" Ms Carruthers to make a claim if that is meant to convey anything other than acting for her (until 10 June 2005) and then taking steps to obtain funding for her defence and pursuit of the cross claim, both of which were undertaken for Ms Carruthers' benefit and the GIO.  Further, [71B] of the FASOC pleads that, but for Prescott's third and fourth GIO misconduct, Ms Carruthers would not have continued to defend the proceedings or pursued her cross claim and, instead, Mrs Marshall would have obtained summary judgment. In light of the statement in Mr Prescott's letter of 30 July 2004 (see [79]) and paragraph F of the recitals to the Final Funding Agreement noted above (at [81]), I accept that assertion.  It seems that Ms Carruthers did not want to assume any further risks in conducting litigation after her loss in the Court of Appeal.
221However what legal duty was infringed by this conduct of Mr Prescott? Paragraph 77 of the FASOC alleges that the so called ""Prescott's second Marshall misconduct"" (which is defined as the ""Prescott first, second and third GIO misconduct"", and which I will treat as including the ""Prescott fourth GIO misconduct"") constituted (i) a breach of the ""ongoing terms of [Mr Prescott's] former retainer from the plaintiffs [presumably Mrs Marshall] (express or implied)""; (ii) a breach of a duty of care said to be owed to the Marshalls by Mr Prescott; (iii) a breach of the fiduciary duty he is said to have owed the Marshalls; (iv) a breach of his obligation to keep confidential the information he had obtained during his retainer from them either under the terms of the retainer or as an obligation of conscience""; and (v) a conspiracy between the GIO and Carruthers either by unlawful acts or by lawful acts with the intention or ""predominant purpose of harming the [Marshalls'] legitimate financial interests"".  These allegations are repeated and slightly expanded upon at [103] to [107] of the FASOC.
222None of these allegations has any substance.  In relation to (iii), for the reasons already noted and as was eventually conceded on behalf of the Marshalls, Mr Prescott's fiduciary duty to them did not survive the termination of the retainer. In relation to (i), there was no attempt made to substantiate the existence of any express or implied term to the effect contended for that somehow survived the termination of Mr Prescott's retainer.  As noted, in Kallinicos Brereton J found that the contractual duty of loyalty did not survive the termination of the retainer.
223Similarly, in relation to (ii) Mr Bevan's initial submissions of 15 August 2013 (at [123] to [125]) simply asserted the existence of a duty of care and did not attempt to differentiate between the period during and after the termination of the retainer.  It articulated the duty in terms that reflect a fiduciary duty, namely to ""promote and protect only the interests of the [Marshalls] in connection with the Pennsylvania proceedings"".  A duty of care expressed in those terms can never arise (Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer [2007] HCA 42; 234 CLR 330 at [49] per Gummow J).  Hence the original misconception about the effect of the decision in Beach Petroleum NL v Abbott Tout Russell Kennedy [1999] NSWCA 408; 48 NSWLR 1 informs this aspect of the Marshalls' claim.  In any event, in respect of the period after the breach of the retainer and, in the absence of any properly developed argument, I do not accept that Mr Prescott owed Mrs Marshall a duty of care given that he was at that time retained to act on behalf of Ms Carruthers.  To impose a duty of care on Mr Prescott in those circumstances would be inconsistent with his duty to Ms Carruthers.  (It may be that Mr Prescott was in breach of the duty of care he owed Ms Carruthers if he was impeded in acting on her behalf for any reason of any obligation of confidence he owed Mrs Marshall:  see Spector v Ageda [1973] Ch 30.  However that is irrelevant for present purposes.)
224In relation to the claimed breach of an obligation of confidence, I have already addressed in detail the alleged confidential information that Mr Prescott is said to have misused in the period after the termination of his retainer.  It has not been established that Mr Prescott misused any confidential information exclusive to the Marshalls in the period up to his ceasing to act on behalf of Ms Carruthers in the Marshall proceedings.
225The conspiracy allegation also fails.  It follows from the above that the acts of Mr Prescott in procuring funding were not ""unlawful"".  Most significantly there is not a scintilla of evidence that either the GIO or Ms Carruthers agreed with Mr Prescott or anyone else to commit any ""unlawful acts"".
226In relation to the allegation of a conspiracy by lawful means, as noted, it is necessary to establish a predominant purpose to harm the Marshalls' interests (Crofter).  In the plaintiffs' written submissions in reply dated 19 August 2013 at [15], Mr Bevan sought to address this as follows:
""In reply to [the defendant's written submissions dated 15 August 2013 at [47]], the evidence of the intention to harm the interests of the Marshalls is the conduct taken to secure an entitlement to the fund for Carruthers without any real insight whatsoever into the Pennsylvania law which was later relied on to support it. A reckless disregard for the rights of one client to disadvantage another client is evidence of intention to harm the second client because there is no bona fide belief held as to the prosecution of any legitimate rights of the first client which are said to compete with the latter client's rights.""
227This submission was directed to a period after the termination of Mr Prescott's retainer with Mrs Marshall so that the suggestion he had two clients is ill founded.  Otherwise I do not accept that Mr Prescott had anything other than a bona fide belief that Ms Carruthers had an arguable claim.  Mr Prescott, Ms Carruthers and the GIO acted to further her and the GIO's legitimate interests which suffices to defeat the allegation of a conspiracy by lawful means (Crofter supra).  Generally, the proposition that a solicitor who procures funding for their client thereby enters into a tortious conspiracy with their client and their funder to harm the other party to litigation is simply bizarre.
228I reject so much of Mrs Marshall's case that alleges that Mr Prescott is liable to her because he engaged in the  Prescott's first, second, third and fourth GIO misconduct.
The (so called) Prescott's Third Marshall Misconduct
229This alleged misconduct was defined in [79] of the FASOC as follows:
""Although he ceased to act for Carruthers in the Carruthers proceeding in the formal sense, Prescott continued to act for her informally by seeking information on Pennsylvania law to support her defence and cross-claim in the Carruthers proceeding and did so in breach of his obligation of confidence to the [Marshalls], in breach of his fiduciary duty to the [Marshalls], in breach of his contractual duties to the [Marshalls] and in breach of his tortious duties to the [Marshalls] under the terms of the Prescott retainer (Prescott's third Marshall misconduct).""  (emboldened emphasis in original;  italicised emphasis added)
230There is no doubt that from the period of the cessation of his retainer by Ms Carruthers in June 2005 until he was injuncted in November 2005 Mr Prescott continued to assist Ms Carruthers in her defence of Mrs Marshall's proceedings.  However this allegation is more narrowly focused and only concerns his conduct in ""informally ... seeking information on Pennsylvania law"". 
231Paragraphs 80 and 103 to 107 make the same allegations in respect of this so called misconduct as I have noted in [221] above in relation to the Prescotts second Marshall misconduct. 
232The findings I have made in relation to the allegations of breach of fiduciary duty, negligence and breach of the retainer at [222] to [223] apply with equal force to Prescott's third Marshall misconduct. 
233Sub-paragraph 80(d) of the FASOC alleges that the Prescott's third Marshall misconduct ""constituted ... a breach of the fiduciary duty he owed to the plaintiffs and the obligation to keep confidential the information he had obtained during his retainer from them"". Paragraph 106(a) is in similar terms.  In the discussion at [163] to [192] I rejected the suggestion that Mr Prescott misused any information exclusively confidential to the Marshalls, save that I observed that prima facie he appears to have misused the information that was passed on to him by Mr Greenwell, as referred to in Mr Prescott's letter of 11 August 2005 ([179]). 
234However, I decline to make any finding to that effect because no such allegation is raised by the pleaded case.  The pleaded case in this respect is confined to an abuse of information acquired during the course of Mr Prescott's retainer with the Marshalls of which this is not.  It also only alleges a breach of the obligation of confidence by Mr Prescott in ""seeking information on Pennsylvania law"". There is nothing to suggest that Mr Prescott used any of the information he obtained from Mr Greenwell for that purpose. 
235This may appear to involve an overly strict approach to the pleaded case. However it is necessitated by the observations at [193] to [194] and the course of the submissions on this topic which I traced at [143] to [149]. The Marshalls only identified the confidential material with precision in their final written submissions in reply dated 9 October 2013 and in doing so implicitly suggested that its deployment involved a misuse.  This course precluded Mr Prescott from having a proper opportunity to consider whether what was finally alleged against him was consistent with the FASOC.  In those circumstances no departure from the pleaded case should be permitted.
236The conspiracy allegations in respect of Prescott's third Marshall misconduct fail for the same reasons they did in relation to Prescott's first, second, third and fourth GIO misconduct.
The (so called) Prescott's Fourth Marshall misconduct
237I have already addressed this at [197] above.
Mr Prescott's estoppel defences
238Only Mrs Marshall was a party to the Prescott proceedings and the Marshall proceedings. Thus, to the extent that recovery was sought in these proceedings of the solicitor/client component cost of those proceedings, then only Mrs Marshall can recover them.  Kim Marshall's rights of recovery are limited to the claim for exemplary and punitive damages. 
239Mr Kelly SC contended that, even if  Mrs Marshall established a cause of action against Mr Prescott, she was not able to recover the solicitor/client component of her costs in the Prescott proceedings and the Marshall proceedings. He contended that the issue of the costs of those proceedings has already been determined by the costs orders that were made in each of those proceedings. For the reasons that follow I accept Mr Kelly SC's contention so far as it concerns the solicitor/client component of the Prescott proceedings, but reject it so far as it concerns the solicitor/client component of the Marshall proceedings.
240At the outset Mr Bevan contended that Mr Prescott ""waived"" his right to rely on these defences because it was said they had been withdrawn in January 2011 and only reinstated  this year following an application by Mr Prescott to amend his defence (Marshall v Prescott (No 4) [2013] NSWSC 455) (plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 at [143]).  He pointed to the cost and disbursements incurred in the meantime as well the ""stress"" of the litigation occasioned in the interim when there was no risk of these defences being upheld.  Although the submission referred to the defences being ""waived"", the footnote to the submission referred to numerous passages from Commonwealth v Verwayen [1990] HCA 39; 170 CLR 394 which discuss both estoppel and waiver.  Other than the incurring of costs which can be addressed if necessary, the balance of the claimed detrimental reliance was not the subject of any evidence so that no question of any estoppel sufficient to preclude these defences being relied on even arises.  As for waiver, only Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Verwayen found that there was some form of ""waiver"" that precluded the Commonwealth's reliance on the limitation defence.  Further,  Gaudron J did so in the context of ""deliberate action or inaction which has resulted in a changed relationship to which the parties will be held whether or not detriment is actually established"" (Verwayen at 485).  This has no relevance to this case and thus the particular form of waiver found in Verwayen by their Honours has no application here.
241In relation to the solicitor/client costs of the Prescott proceedings, Mr Kelly SC pointed to a stream of judicial statements that precludes one party from recovering further costs from another in a separate action where there was a judicial pronouncement of the parties' respective costs entitlements in a previous proceedings (defendant's written submissions dated 15 August 2013 at [144] to [150]).  Thus in Anderson v Bowles [1951] HCA 61; 84 CLR 310, Dixon, Williams, Fullagar and Kitto JJ stated at 323:
""It is a general rule that where it is sought to include costs incurred in other proceedings in the damages arising upon a cause of action, costs shall not be included, if as a matter of judicial determination or by a positive rule of law they are treated as costs which should be borne by the party suing. Accordingly it is not possible to recover as part of such damages the difference between party and party costs awarded to the plaintiff in the original litigation and the costs as between solicitor and client which he has incurred: Barnett v. Eccles Corporation (1900) 2 QB 423, at p 428. Further, if costs are expressly withheld by the court in the original proceeding none can be recovered in the action for damages brought by the plaintiff from whom they were so withheld.""
242This passage does not specify the precise basis for this ""general rule"".  At least in cases involving a previous ""judicial determination"" it seems that it is a form of res judicata in that the entitlements of the parties in respect of costs merge in the order that is made.  In cases where the ""rule of law"" precluding recovery is a statute then presumably the general rule derives from an ascertainment of a statutory intention that the legislation deals exhaustively with the topic of costs, although it is not necessary to consider this further.
243Mr Kelly SC also referred to Avenhouse v Hornsby Shire Council (1998) 44 NSWLR 1.  In Avenhouse one issue that arose on appeal was whether in proceedings in this Court against the Council for negligence the appellants could recover their costs of litigating against the Council in the Land and Environment Court at the conclusion of which there had been ""no order as to costs"". The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's refusal to allow recovery of those costs.  Sheller JA, with whom Mason P and Priestley JA agreed, found (at 37) that:
""[The appellants] having agreed that there should be no order for costs, they cannot, in my opinion, now seek to go behind that agreement by claiming the costs as damages in the present proceedings.""
Of precise relevance to this case, Sheller JA noted (at 36) that:
""Had [the appellants] obtained an order for costs in the Land and Environment Court, principle would suggest that they could not recover in the present proceedings the difference between the costs assessed and the actual costs or expenses they incurred.""
244Sheller JA did not refer to Anderson in his judgment.  Presumably this is so because his Honour treated ""no order as to costs"" as only an agreement between the parties that precluded later recovery and not as a ""judicial determination or ... positive rule of law"" as referred to in Anderson.
245Mr Bevan contended that there is an exception to the ""general rule"" stated in Anderson as expressed in the following passages from McGregor on Damages, 17th Ed (2003) at 632:
""More difficult are the cases where the now claimant claims that a separate tort was involved in instigating, assisting or causing the previous proceedings and sues for damages for that tort.  Such torts could be malicious prosecution, false imprisonment or conspiracy.  If the now claimant is thus capable of establishing a separate cause of action, it may be that he has found a sufficient peg upon which to claim as damages costs incurred by him in the earlier proceeding. Devlin L.J. in Berry v British Transport Commission [footnote: [1962] 1 Q.B.  306] certainly thought this should be so.  He said:
'I find it difficult to see why the law should not now recognise one standard of costs as between litigants and another when those costs form a legitimate item of damage in a separate cause of action flowing from an additional wrong.' (emphasis added)
...
(c)  Conspiracy.  Conspiracy is another tort which might be held to arise from instigating, assisting or causing the previous proceedings.  This would be analogous to malicious prosecution but would also require an agreement between two parties to bring or defend the previous proceedings:  it might however be wider in that, for instance, it could, unlike malicious prosecution under the present law, apply to all civil actions.  On principle there is no reason why the now claimant should not recover as damages costs incurred by him in the previous proceedings.  In Hathaway v Barrow [footnote:  (1807) 1 Camp. 151] the now defendants had unsuccessfully brought a petition against the now claimant and costs had been awarded against them.  The now claimant claimed to recover as damages the costs he had incurred above those awarded, but the court refused their recovery, Sir James Mansfield saying that those already awarded 'must be considered as satisfaction'.  This, however, is the only case and it is a decision of 1807, which was long before the general principles were worked out by the courts; moreover, it is at odds with the general view of Devlin L.J. already referred to. [footnote:  In Berry v British Transport Commission [1962] 1 Q.B. 306, CA at 322.  See para. 17-005, above]""
246Mr Bevan contended that Mrs Marshall falls within this exception as she sues in conspiracy (plaintiffs' written submissions dated 15 August 2013 at [165]).  I reject this contention for two separate reasons. 
247First, at this point I am dealing with Mrs Marshall's claim for the solicitor/ client costs of the Prescott proceedings.  Mrs Marshall does not allege that any ""separate tort"" on the part of Mr Prescott was ""involved in the instigat[ion], assisting or causing"" of those proceedings, as opposed to Ms Carruthers' defence of the Marshall proceedings. Thus, even if the first passage from McGregor on Damages was to be read as a definitive statement of an exception to the general rule stated in Anderson and the words ""will be"" were substituted for ""may"", it does not assist Mrs Marshall's claim to recover the solicitor/client costs component of the Prescott proceedings.
248Second, I do not accept that the exception alluded to in the passage from McGregor on Damages operates in circumstances where there has been a previous order addressing costs by a Court with full power to award them.  In Avenhouse at 35 Sheller JA noted this possible exception as stated in earlier edition of McGregor on Damages, and then discussed various cases that bore upon the existence of the exception (namely Berry; Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co v Eyre (1883) 11 QBD 674 and Jack L. Israel Ltd v Ocean Dynamic Lines SA & Ocean Victory Ltd [1982] 2 Lloyd's Rep 88). His Honour then referred to Hanrahan v Ainsworth (1985) 1 NSWLR 370 in which a plaintiff claimed damages for the defendant's alleged abuse of legal process by instituting defamation proceedings and sought to recover costs incurred as a result of those defamation proceedings. 
249In Hanrahan at 375 Hunt J stated:
""The first defendant objects that the actual temporal loss upon which the plaintiff relies in the present case (the expenses which he incurred in travelling to see his legal advisers) cannot be recovered in these proceedings. Those expenses, he says, are costs properly recoverable in the earlier defamation action, and only in that action. The expenses necessarily incurred in defending criminal proceedings are recoverable in a subsequent action for damages for malicious prosecution: Savile v Roberts (1698) 1 Ld Raym 374 at 378; 91 ER 1147 at 1150. But, where the action for malicious prosecution is based upon a civil action and not upon criminal proceedings, those costs are recoverable in the earlier action, and not in the action for malicious prosecution: Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co v Eyre (1883) 11 QBD 674 at 690. This is because the successful party in civil proceedings (but not in criminal proceedings) is - so the theory goes - compensated in those proceedings by an order for costs, and the law does not permit that successful party's entitlement to costs in the earlier civil proceedings to be litigated a second time in the claim for damages for malicious prosecution: Berry v British Transport Commission [1962] 1 QB 306 at 320; Coleman v Buckingham's Ltd [1963] SR (NSW) 171 at 176, 177-178; 80 WN 593 at 596-597, 598.
The first defendant's argument does not, however, take into account the fundamental differences between an action for damages for abuse of process and an action for damages for malicious prosecution. (Those differences are also recognized in Coleman v Buckingham's Ltd (at 179; 599).) The difference principally relevant here is the need in the action for malicious prosecution, but not in the action for abuse of process, for the plaintiff to plead and to prove that the earlier proceedings have terminated in his favour. Thus there is not in the action for abuse of process (as there is in the action for malicious prosecution) necessarily an adjudication in the earlier proceedings in relation to the present plaintiff's entitlement to costs. If the earlier proceedings had terminated in favour of the present plaintiff, then his expenses would have been recoverable in those proceedings and they would not support his subsequent action for abuse of process. But, where those earlier proceedings have not so terminated in favour of the present plaintiff, I see no reason why his expenses in relation to those proceedings should not validly support his present claim.""  (emphasis added)
250In Avenhouse at 36 Sheller JA specifically cited the latter part of this passage but I take his Honour as having endorsed the entirety of Hunt J's analysis. Hunt J's analysis was such that it precluded recovery in the latter proceedings of solicitor/client costs in earlier (civil) proceedings where there was an ""adjudication in the earlier proceedings"" as to costs. There was no such adjudication in Hanrahan but there was in this case. I take Sheller JA (with whom Mason P and Priestley JA agreed) in Avenhouse as having endorsed Hunt J's analysis in Hanrahan which confines the operation of any exception of the kind identified in McGregor on Damages in the manner I have stated at [248].
251Otherwise it should be noted that this analysis is only apposite to the circumstance where the earlier proceedings were conducted in a court exercising a civil jurisdiction with full powers to award costs on a variety of bases and in respect of a range of circumstances.  Since Hanrahan and even Avenhouse the powers of this Court hearing civil proceedings to award costs have only expanded so that the rationale for these decisions is even more appropriate now than it ever was.  However the power to award costs in, say, criminal proceedings is more limited.  Thus a different approach has been adopted where the earlier proceedings involve a criminal prosecution (see Berry at 317, 323 to 332 and 336 to 339).
252Mr Kelly SC sought to apply the same analysis to Mrs Marshall's claim to recover the solicitor/client costs component of the Marshall proceedings. Mr Bevan contended that the authorities relied upon by Mr Kelly SC and noted above have no application where the earlier proceedings were not between the same parties.  He contended that, as a matter of principle, there was no difficulty with a party recovering from, say, their solicitor all the costs they incurred in other proceedings against a different party, provided that the usual preconditions for recovery such as causation and remoteness, etc, are satisfied.  I agree (see Provident Capital Ltd v Papa (No 2) [2013] NSWCA 156 at [13] to [17], and cases cited at [14], per Macfarlan JA with whom Sackville AJA agreed).
253Mr Kelly SC sought to rely on an Anshun estoppel as precluding recovery by Mrs Marshall of the solicitor/client costs in the Marshall proceedings.  As I understand this contention it concerns Mrs Marshall's alleged failure to either seek a solicitor/client costs order against Ms Carruthers in the Marshall proceedings or to make such an application against Mr Prescott in the Marshall proceedings, presumably under ss 98 and 99 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005. It is not necessary to address all the potential difficulties with this contention because it suffices to state that I am not satisfied that it was ""unreasonable"" for Mrs Marshall not to have made any such application (Anshun at 602 per Gibbs CJ, Mason and Aickin JJ).  To have done so would have put at risk the favourable settlement she had negotiated with Ms Carruthers.  Moreover I consider that a litigant in her position was entitled to take stock and consider the financial effect of all the costs orders and costs she had incurred before deciding to embark upon further litigation.
Proportionate liability
254Mr Prescott's defence pleaded that Mrs Marshall's and Kim Marshall's claim was an apportionable claim and that there were concurrent wrongdoers, namely Mr Greenwell and Kreindlers.  No submissions were advanced in support of the defence.  In view of my findings, it is neither necessary nor possible to address it.
Causation and quantum
255Various submissions were made by Mr Kelly SC concerning whether any conduct of Mr Prescott was causative of the solicitor/client costs claimed by Mrs Marshall.  I have already addressed one matter relevant to causation in respect of the period prior to the termination of Mr Prescott's retainer to act on behalf of Mrs Marshall and Kim Marshall (at [210]).  In view of my rejection of the entirety of the pleaded allegations against Mr Prescott it is not possible to address the balance of the points raised.
256In relation to quantum, I have already addressed Mr Kelly SC's submission concerning Mr Salier's assessment.  Obviously, the claim for exemplary or punitive damages fails.
Orders
257I will order that the proceedings be dismissed and hear the parties as to costs.
258Accordingly the Court orders that:
(1)The proceedings be dismissed.

2705667,R v Boutros [2013] NSWDC 291,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: Earlier this year, after a very short trial in which there was very little in dispute, a jury found Charbel Boutros guilty of an offence of attempting to possess a marketable quantity of cocaine which had been imported into Australia. The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment. It is now my task to sentence him.

2I described the trial as very short. The evidence consisted largely of an agreed statement of facts in which the Crown and Mr Boutros jointly put before the jury a summary of the evidence. This was supplemented by oral evidence from two police officers and other exhibits which amplified the contents of the agreed statement of facts. There was very little dispute as to what had actually occurred, but there remained a dispute for the jury to resolve concerning what inferences could safely be drawn from those facts. The jury clearly accepted the Crown submission that the evidence demonstrated Mr Boutros' guilt.

3A quantity of cocaine was imported into Australia concealed in what were purported to be tubs of sun block cream. The package was intercepted by Customs and police, who removed the cocaine and re-constructed the packaged using an inert powder. Arrangements were then made by an AFP officer posing as a delivery driver to deliver the package to the purported intended recipient. Although the consignment note indicated the package was to be delivered to ""George Sarkis"", in fact that identity was being used by a man named ""Abdulla"". Intercepted telephone calls between Mr Boutros and Mr Abdulla revealed Mr Boutros' involvement in some aspects of the process of gaining possession of the package containing the cocaine. For example he appears to have made an inquiry, probably over the internet, as to the status of the package and informed Mr Abdulla that it appeared that delivery of the package had been delayed. He expressed the opinion that that meant that police involvement was likely.

4Today a reference tendered on behalf of Mr Boutros indicated that he had previously worked for TNT a courier company and it is possible that Mr Boutros' opinion was formed using knowledge gained when he worked for that company. After expressing that opinion to Mr Abdulla (and of course the words used between Mr Abdulla and Mr Boutros were not as clear as I have summarised), Mr Boutros went to a shop which was being renovated. The evidence would suggest that Mr Boutros was there for a genuine reason involving the renovation of that shop. The address of the shop was given to the pretend delivery driver by Mr Abdulla as a place where the package could be delivered. 

5When the pretend delivery driver went to the shop he met with Mr Boutros. They had a conversation which was recorded on a listening device worn by the police officer pretending to be the delivery driver. The conversation, parts of which were extremely difficult to hear, revealed that Mr Boutros claimed no knowledge of the package. He expressed no great desire to receive the package, but at one stage suggested to the delivery driver that if he wanted to leave the package at the shop, he could, because at least that way it would be delivered. The precise words he said were, ""It's up to you man, if you want to leave it here it's up to you, but... then it gets delivered you see."" 

6Initially when I instructed the jury I instructed them that it was the conduct of Mr Boutros in speaking the words to which I have just referred which they should consider in deciding whether that conduct amounted to an attempt to possess the cocaine. However in response to a question from the jury, and over the protests of Mr Stanton who appeared and still appears for Mr Boutros, I later instructed the jury that if the elements of the offence were all present at an earlier time then they could convict Mr Boutros. I did this because it had always been part of the Crown case that the conduct of Mr Boutros in going to the shop in the first place could have constituted, without anything more, an attempt to possess the cocaine. 

7The question from the jury and the speed with which a verdict of guilty was returned after that question was answered reveals the almost inescapable conclusion that at least one member of the jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Boutros' conduct in speaking to the pretend delivery driver at the shop amounted to the offence, but was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his earlier conduct in going to the shop did amount to the offence. We do not know whether some jurors perhaps would not have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offence was committed simply by Mr Boutros going to the shop in the first place. In those circumstances it falls to me to decide the factual basis on which I will sentence Mr Boutros. 

8I will sentence him on the basis that when he spoke to the delivery driver he believed that their was cocaine in the package that the delivery driver had with him, that he intended to possess that package and that his conduct in suggesting the possibility that the delivery driver could leave the package in the shop amounted to conduct in pursuit of that intention which was more than merely preparatory. I do not need to decide whether Mr Boutros went to the shop with the intention of gaining possession of a package or whether he only formed that intention after he as at the shop.

9I do have to say that there was clear evidence of other offences committed by Mr Boutros, offences which would have been much easier to prove than the one chosen by the prosecution. For example when Mr Boutros checked on the status of the package pursuant to a request from Mr Abdulla that was an overt act performed as part of a conspiracy between Mr Boutros and Mr Abdulla. I mention this fact not at all to suggest that I will sentence Mr Boutros for an offence with which he has not been charged let alone convicted, but merely to question the choice of charge brought by the prosecution which made its case a lot harder than it truly should have been.

10Although Mr Boutros of course did not plead guilty there was a considerable utilitarian benefit in the way the trial was run. The agreed statement of facts contained almost all the evidence which the jury needed to hear. His cooperation in running this trial this way entitles him to a lesser sentence than would otherwise have been the case. 

11The gross weight of the powder was almost 900 grams. The net weight of the cocaine being 324.1 grams. Not surprisingly that quantity of cocaine is very valuable. Its street value is in the order of quarter of a million dollars with its wholesale value about half that.

12The offender is approaching 30 years of age with no prior convictions. He does have two matters on his criminal history both of which were dealt with under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and I am prepared to find for the purposes of sentencing today that he is a man of prior good character. As well as evidence of character in the negative sense, that is no prior convictions there is evidence of character in the positive sense. He appears to have been a hard working, industrious man who comes from a family providing good influences upon him. For example his siblings four sisters and two brothers have all pursued tertiary education. Mr Boutros has pursued employment which does not involve tertiary education but which involves hard work and skill. He is working in building maintenance and also assisting others for free doing home maintenance jobs. A number of references attested to the character of the offender and suggested that his conduct which has led to him facing sentence today was completely out of character. 

13Of course one of the most important factors, if not the most important factor, in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon Mr Boutros is the objective gravity of what he did. The Crown describes his role as being that of a low level courier and says it was a relatively minor role. It is the offender saying those words, ""If you want to leave it here it's up to you, but... then it gets delivered you see"" which amount to the commission of the offence. That is the criminal conduct covered by the charge for which Mr Boutros must be sentenced. As I have said on earlier occasions this is barely a crime, but it is a crime nevertheless. It was his intention that those words would persuade the courier, or at least the person he thought was a courier, to leave the package with him so that Mr Abdulla could gain possession of it. 

14The Crown submitted that despite the lack of convictions of Mr Boutros this was a case where prior good character has less of a role to play than in other cases. Over the years I have watched as a category of cases where prior good character plays less of a role has been expanded until many types of offences are dealt with with that principle in mind. But I do not accept the Crown submission this is not a case where Mr Boutros was chosen because he had no prior convictions. There was no connection between the lack of criminal history and the offence. The principle the Crown relies on arises because in cases such as importing drugs into Australia through the airport, couriers with no criminal convictions are less likely to be detected than those who do have criminal convictions. But here the man purporting to be the courier was not going to ask whether Mr Boutros had any criminal history before handing over the package. I will therefore give full weight to Mr Boutros' prior good character in assessing the sentence to impose upon him.

15The Crown also suggests that whilst there was no evidence of financial gain it is to be inferred that there would be some financial benefit to the offender. It is easy to state the principle of law that circumstances of aggravation have to be proved by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt and circumstances of mitigation have to be proved by an offender on the balance of probabilities. But it is not so easy to discern into which category various factors fall. In this case is it an aggravating factor that Mr Boutros would receive financial gain or is it a mitigating factor that he would not? The matter is not without difficulty but I am prepared to proceed on the former alternative such that it would be for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt financial gain was to be received by Mr Boutros and if it cannot do that beyond reasonable doubt then that aggravating factor is to be ignored.

16In this case there is simply no evidence at all of any financial gain to Mr Boutros. At one stage Mr Abdulla asks Mr Boutros to do him a ""big favour"" which is more consistent with there being no financial gain than the alternative. There is no mention of any financial gain in any of the recorded telephone calls and so I will sentence Mr Boutros on the basis that he was not to be paid or receive any other benefit for what he did.

17Also in assessing the objective criminality is this circumstance. The evidence would suggest that Mr Boutros' possession of the drug package, were it to be left with him, was to have been for a short time, it being highly likely that the plan was that Mr Boutros would contact Mr Abdulla, tell him that the package had been delivered and Mr Abdulla would come to the shop and collect it.

18I note that Mr Boutros had done 11 days in prison. Now no one would suggest that that is lengthy time, but I will say that any day in prison is a bad day, especially for a person going to prison for the first time. The fact that the offender has spent 11 days in prison, albeit as I noted that being a very short time, is a factor that I take into account in determining ultimately what sentence is to be imposed. 

19The Crown made its position quite clear, nothing less than fulltime custody was required. It relied on a number of comparative cases which of course were all helpful. But none of the cases involved criminality of such a low level as the present case. 

20Mr Stanton conceded that a custodial sentence was required. I agree. That leaves for determination the length of the sentence and if the length of the sentence is such that alternatives to fulltime custody are available whether those alternatives are appropriate. 

21It is a fundamental rule that a sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of what an offender did. Usually that principle is used to suggest the need for a sentence of some severity but it also applies to cases where criminality is, as I have found, relatively low. For those reasons I have determined that although a custodial sentence is required it is likely that the sentence I will impose will be two years imprisonment. Accordingly I turn my attention as to whether it is appropriate that the sentence be served other than by fulltime imprisonment. I am certainly satisfied that a suspended sentence is completely inappropriate as, although a real sentence of imprisonment, it would do little, if anything, by way of general deterrence. 

22However I am satisfied that it is appropriate that Mr Boutros be given the opportunity to be assessed as to his suitability to serve his sentence by way of an Intensive Corrections Order. This will involve an element of punishment. This will involve some general deterrence, of course not as much as were fulltime custody imposed and it will, I am satisfied, in the circumstances of this case properly reflect the offence and the offender. 

23 I will adjourn the matter till 2 pm on Friday 7 March. I will continue Mr Boutros' bail to that occasion. I will order that he is assessed for his suitability to serve his sentence by way of Intensive Corrections Order.

		28 February 2014",2013-12-19 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705668,Outram v R [2013] NSWCCA 329,"Judgment
1LEEMING JA:  The applicant, Mr Darren Ty Outram, seeks leave to appeal against his conviction by a jury on four charges of sexual assault on 24 March 2011 following a three day trial before his Honour Ellis DCJ in the District Court at Gosford.  The applicant was sentenced on 6 May 2011 for a total sentence of five years and six months with a non-parole period of three years.  The sentence dated from 25 March 2011, so that the first date on which the applicant will be eligible to apply for release on parole is 24 March 2014.
2That is to say, the application was heard when the applicant had already served more than 32 months of the minimum custodial period of 36 months.
3That delay was attributable to the fact that the application for leave to appeal was only filed on 13 June 2013, more than two years after the applicant had been sentenced.
4There was scant explanation for the delay.  The applicant said that within about two weeks after his being sentenced, his barrister (who had not appeared at the trial and is not subject to the complaints now sought to be raised) had visited him in custody and told him that ""I had no chance of an appeal"".  The applicant said that he had health problems, including chest pain and an adverse reaction to medication for high cholesterol levels.  No medical evidence was adduced in support of those claims.  The applicant also said that he was moved around from gaol to gaol in 2011, from Parramatta to Long Bay Hospital to Parklea to Kirkconnell and eventually Bathurst in October 2011.  He said that he attempted to file appeal documents between January and April 2012, but they were rejected.  He applied for Legal Aid for an appeal in March 2012 and in May 2012 Legal Aid requested transcripts and the court file.  On 19 November 2012, Legal Aid was advised that the summing up of the trial had not been revised by Ellis DCJ; this was provided on 13 December 2012.  Counsel was initially briefed on 11 January 2013, and provided with further documents (including the complete ERISP, counsel's address and the triple-O calls) in March 2013.  On 4 June 2013 counsel provided written submissions which were careful and detailed and which were ultimately relied on when the application was heard.
Nature of proposed appeal
5The notice of application for leave to appeal filed 13 June 2013 identifies two grounds:
""1. The failure of trial counsel to call evidence of good character at the applicant's trial occasioned a miscarriage of justice.
2. The applicant's trial miscarried because of the incompetence of his trial counsel in:(a) failing to properly cross-examine the complainant;(b) failing to properly adduce evidence from the applicant;(c) failing to ensure that only relevant material was contained in the ERISP interview conducted between the applicant and the police.""
6The first ground, based on failure to call evidence of good character, was at the forefront of the applicant's written and oral submissions.  Central to it was the claim that character witnesses who were ready, willing and available to be called at the trial were not called.
7In support of those grounds, the applicant swore two affidavits, on which he was cross-examined.  The entirety of his evidence in chief in support of his grounds was as follows:
""2.  When I was first charged I applied for legal aid.  In early 2010 my case was allocated to Margaret Zahra, a lawyer employed at the Gosford office of Legal Aid.  I saw Ms Zahra a number of times. I gave her instructions that she wrote down.  I recall that during our meetings we discussed getting witnesses to my good character.
3.  In about September 2010 my case was transferred to Mr Brian Quinn, a solicitor in private practice in Gosford.  He briefed Mr O'Sullivan to appear for me.
4.  I saw Mr Quinn a lot more than Mr O'Sullivan.  I recall on at least two occasions telling them that I could arrange for character witnesses to attend my trial.  I also tried to give them instructions.  I recall writing everything I could think of out for them.
5.  Both Mr Quinn and Mr O'Sullivan told me that I did not need to call character witnesses because I could not be convicted.  I had never been involved in a trial before and accepted this advice.
6.  After I was convicted but before I was sentenced I was able to obtain new lawyers.  I told the new lawyers that there were people who could speak of my good character.  The lawyers told me to ask for references and I did so.  A number of people wrote references about me that were tendered in the sentence hearing.""
8The applicant also served an affidavit of his fiancée, Ms Dale Littler, who said that she was prepared to give evidence, although reluctant to do so.  She recalled Mr Quinn saying that character witnesses were not needed.
9It may be accepted that the applicant told his solicitor that his recollection, in June 2013, was that more than two years earlier his lawyers had advised him that he ""could not be convicted"", and for that reason had not advised that character evidence was necessary.  However, I think it must be said that it fell to his solicitor in 2013 taking that evidence to test the applicant's recollection of such inherently unlikely advice very carefully.  I return to this below.  
10In opposition, the Crown served affidavits of the solicitor Mr Quinn and barrister Mr O'Sullivan who had been retained by the applicant at the trial (they had been released from obligations of confidentiality by the applicant).  Both men denied advising the applicant that he could not be convicted, or that it was unlikely that he would be convicted.  Both denied saying that there was no need to call character witnesses for that reason.
11Those four witnesses were cross-examined, efficiently and relatively briefly, in this Court.
Nature of Crown and defence cases at trial
12There was a strong Crown case at trial.  The complainant told the jury that on 3 December 2009 she returned home to find the applicant standing outside her home, not wearing pants.  She formed the view he was drunk.  It is not necessary to detail all of the evidence as to what occurred throughout the balance of the afternoon and evening.  It suffices to say that she claimed that he assaulted her, pulling off her lower clothes, penetrated her digitally, struck her head with his own head, and lifted her by her breasts and twisted them.  She said that he said he was getting a knife, at which point she ran outside, wearing only her shirt.  Two uniformed police officers arrived and went to her aid.  One officer identified the applicant carrying a knife (the other, for medical reasons, was not called at the trial).
13There was a triple-O call made from the house at 12.26am, in which the applicant could be heard calling ""ya bitch, ya whore"".  The Crown contended that the complainant could be heard in the recording saying ""don't hurt me"", although that did not appear in the transcript, and the recording was not in evidence in this Court.
14The complainant's jeans and underwear were found in her house.  She had been wearing three quarter length jeans, with a zipper and button at the waist.  The jeans were found still buttoned and zipped up, consistent with them having been pulled off her forcibly.
15The complainant was examined by a doctor at around 5am that morning, who observed bruising to her forehead, multiple bruises throughout her body including to both breasts, abrasion to her vagina, and no injuries consistent with offensive acts (such as injury to her knuckles).  There was no delay in her making complaint of sexual assault.
16The applicant was found with bruising to his head consistently with having struck the complainant's head with his own.
17The defence case was that there had been consensual sexual activity in the afternoon when the complainant returned, that she then became intoxicated and attacked him, and threatened to telephone the police.  He said in effect that she opened the door when the police arrived, and began to scream, leading to his arrest.  He said that the complainant had had a fall at work which accounted for the injuries to her body.  He denied having possession of any knife and said the police officer was mistaken.  Although interviewed by police that evening, he did not say that the complainant had been drinking.  He said that ""she was hysterical and going off her brain for no basic reason whatsoever"".
18The defence case was more elaborate than indicated above, but on this application for an extension of time, it is not necessary to refer to all of its nuances.  It was common ground when the application was heard that the Crown had a strong case.  The Crown described it as ""overwhelming"", and counsel for the applicant described it as an ""obvious[ly] strong Crown case"".
Applicable legal principles for extension of time
19It would flout the legislative command if no regard were had to the signal breach of the time periods in this application.  This Court has repeatedly and properly emphasised that time limitations cannot be ignored.  As was said in Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142 at [83] (Simpson J, Johnson J and Grove AJ agreeing):  
""Time limits are fixed by legislation for the making of applications (of any kind) for good reason. While it is relatively commonplace for this Court to permit a substantial degree of latitude in sentencing matters, there must be boundaries. The Court will, especially in cases of substantial delay, look for a satisfactory explanation for the failure to pursue a remedy at the appropriate time: see Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199; Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424.""  
20In Darwiche v R [2011] NSWCCA 62; 209 A Crim R 424 Johnson J (with the agreement of McClellan CJ at CL and James J) referred at [38]-[39] to the undoubted fact that ""the longer time passes without an appeal being filed, the more solid ought be the expectation of the community, witnesses, victims and the families of victims that the criminal proceedings are over"" as a significant consideration to be taken into account on a leave application.  His Honour also referred to the interests of justice including those of the Crown (representing the community and the administration of justice generally), as well as the interests of the applicant for leave.
21These authorities more recently were reviewed in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [31]-[53], where it was concluded (in a case where there had been a change in the law subsequent to the trial) that ""all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result"".  When considering the question of substantial injustice, the Court said that:
""This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a 'more summary fashion' than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time.""
22In Alpha v R [2013] NSWCCA 292 at [1] and [15] and in Golossian v R [2013] NSWCCA 311 at [28] this Court confirmed, if it was not already clear, that the same principles applied in all cases where an extension of time is required.
23That said, the legal system places a high value on fair procedure and correct outcome:  Sinkovich v Attorney General for NSW [2013] NSWCA 383.  As RA Hulme J observed (in respect of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules) in Bourke v R [2013] NSWCCA 293 at [41], ""this Court is always alive to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice and will readily intervene when it is detected.""  
24Here it is clear that there is substantial and largely unsatisfactorily explained delay, and the interests of the community and of the victim are relatively strong.  However, if indeed the applicant had character witnesses to hand who were not called because the lawyers appearing for him at trial were so confident of his success that they saw no need to do so, then there would have been a substantial miscarriage of justice.  That indeed is the nature of the claim which he brings, supported by affidavit evidence.  The Crown expressed concern that, through alleging incompetence of counsel, the ordinary strictures against fresh or further evidence have been bypassed, as a result of which it has been necessary for four witnesses (none of whom are from Sydney) to be cross-examined;  cf KLM v Western Australia [2009] WASCA 73;  194 A Crim R 503 at [97].  That may be difficult to reconcile with the application being dealt with in a ""more summary fashion"" than would have been the case had it been brought within time.  However, given the stark disparity in the testimony of the applicant and his former lawyers, and the importance to the applicant and to the administration of justice more generally that the substantial miscarriage of justice to which he has sworn be ventilated, it was necessary and appropriate for that to occur.  
25It is also necessary to make findings of fact - for if the applicant is right, he has been denied a fair trial and the recollections of his former lawyers are in error. 
Findings
26I do not accept the evidence of the applicant that he was told that he could not be convicted.  First, such advice is inherently unlikely to be given even in respect of the weakest Crown case which the Director of Public Prosecutions has determined to commence and maintain.  
27Secondly, as noted above, it was common ground when the application was heard that the Crown case was strong (as to which see further below) - it was not a sexual assault based on ""word on word"" disputed testimonial evidence, for there was also the recorded triple-O call, the police officer who saw the applicant pursuing the complainant and holding a knife, the complainant's jeans found still buttoned and the medical evidence consistent with the assault of which the complainant testified.  The applicant submitted in this Court that the Crown case had in truth been strong, and yet that his own lawyers had told him that he could not lose.  Such a situation is certainly conceivable, but it is relatively improbable.
28Thirdly, the applicant was equally adamant that he had never been advised about pleading guilty and receiving a reduction in his sentence.  His cross-examination included the following:
""Q.  Did anyone ever talk to you about pleading guilty?A.  No, they did not.
Q.  Never?A.  Never, it was never brought up.
Q.  What about when you spoke to Legal Aid, did anyone there talk to you about pleading guilty?A.  No.
Q.  Never?A.  Never.
Q.  Did anyone ever mention to you a 25 per cent discount if you pleaded guilty?A.  No they didn't.
Q.  And I'm including Legal Aid there, no one at Legal Aid said that to you?A.  No, there was never any offer made to me if I plead.
Q.  Are you clear about that?A.  I'm positive.
Q.  Positive about that?A.  Yes.""
29But the applicant was, indisputably, advised of precisely that, and repeatedly.  A note of that advice, given early (prior to Messrs Quinn and O'Sullivan being retained) was in evidence.  There can be no doubt that the applicant had been advised by the solicitor previously acting for him that he would receive a discount for a plea of guilty, in light of his written instructions on 29 June 2010.  The advice was plainly appropriate, having regard to the evident strength of the Crown case.  And in light of the demonstrated fallibility of the applicant's recollection and the obvious strength of the Crown case, there is likewise no reason to doubt the inherently plausible statement in Mr Quinn's letter written shortly after the trial that he too had advised of that matter:
""Strong Crown case, Mr Outram was given advice and there was an offer of a lesser charge to a plea at one stage but he maintained his innocence."" 
30Fourthly, evidence was tendered at his sentencing hearing by Ms Littler that the applicant was ""dazed"", ""stressed"" and had a tendency to ""scramble"" conversations in the weeks leading up to the trial.  His evidence in 2013 about conversations which took place more than two years ago is unlikely to be more cogent.  When confronted with this, Ms Littler accepted that there were times when his state of mind accorded with her evidence at the sentencing hearing.  
31Fifthly, Messrs O'Sullivan and Quinn were experienced practitioners in the area of criminal law.  I accept the Crown's submission:
""To suggest that any experienced lawyer would advise an accused person not to bother with potentially useful evidence because he could not be convicted defies common sense.  It is inconceivable that any experienced lawyer would tender such advice.""
32Accordingly, I reject the primary thrust of the applicant's evidence - that the reason no character evidence was called was because he had been advised that he could not lose.  On the evidence before this Court, that did not occur.  I have reached that conclusion without relying on the demeanour of any witness while giving evidence. 
33That conclusion is not sufficient to resolve ground 1.  For, although I cannot accept that the reasons for the failure to call character evidence were those put forward by the applicant, the question why that did not occur remains outstanding.   
34Precisely why no character evidence was called at the applicant's trial can never be known with certainty; that is a consequence in large measure of the fallibility of human recollection, exacerbated by the delay in bringing this application.  I do not find it surprising that the witnesses' recollections had faded.  I turn now to what is established on the evidence in this Court which bears upon the question. 
35First, it does seem clear that Ms Littler supported the applicant throughout the preparation for, and during, the trial.  However, it is also clear that she was reluctant to be a witness.  She maintained in her affidavit that she would have done so if she had been asked, but in cross-examination she accepted that Mr O'Sullivan asked her to give character evidence, and then said:
""Q.  What did you say to that?A.  That I don't really want to, but if I have to I will.  I'd rather be in the courtroom with Darren.
Q.  So Mr O'Sullivan specifically asked you if you were prepared to go into the witness box and give character evidence on Mr Outram's behalf?A.  Yep.
Q.  And your priority was to be a support person in the courtroom.A.  Yes.
Q.  Didn't you tell him that you didn't want to go into the witness box?A. As I just said, I said I didn't want to, but I would if I had to.""
36It would have been open for the applicant's lawyers in 2011 to form the view that a relatively unenthusiastic current partner of the accused, who was very visibly attending the trial and supporting her partner, would be more effective in that way than through reluctantly giving testimonial evidence.  I do not mean to convey any personal criticism of her, but she was not an impressive witness when cross-examined.
37Secondly, the extent to which other witnesses would have been prepared to assist, having been told of the medical evidence, the triple-O call, and the obsessive telephone calls that afternoon, is also unclear.  Eight character references were tendered on the sentence proceedings.  Just why none of this was adduced is not clearly established on the evidence.  Ms Littler was the only character witness who swore an affidavit in this Court, her lack of enthusiasm was apparent, and there is no sound reason to conclude that any of the other potential witnesses would be less unenthusiastic. 
38Thirdly, there can be no suggestion that Mr O'Sullivan was oblivious to the potentially powerful advantage to an accused of good character.  He said in cross-examination that he was aware of its importance, and as much was demonstrated by the course of the trial.  In the Crown case, Mr O'Sullivan asked one of the police officers to confirm the applicant had no criminal convictions.  Immediately thereafter, Mr O'Sullivan sought and obtained a standard direction as to good character from the trial judge.  That direction was therefore heard by the jury before the applicant gave evidence.  It was repeated in the summing up.  It was, to say the least, open to counsel then appearing for the applicant to make the forensic decision that his client's interests were best served by obtaining that direction at the first possible opportunity.  Mr O'Sullivan candidly admitted that he lacked an actual recollection of his thought process and was speculating, but he said in his affidavit that he thought he might have applied for the ruling when he did (something which seems to have surprised the trial judge) because he had been sceptical that there would be any character evidence forthcoming. 
39Fourthly, there was disputed evidence that the applicant had offered to provide personal references, and his counsel had said ""good, bring them to court, I will talk to them"".  That did not occur.  Mr O'Sullivan said that had they been provided, ""I would have spoken to them first and if I thought that they would be appropriate to be called, yes I would have called them"".  Aside from the applicant's evidence to the effect that his lawyers told him not to bother because he could not be convicted, which I do not accept, that is the best evidence as to what occurred, and it is inherently plausible.
40Fifthly, it would seem that Mr Quinn made little or no effort himself to meet or see those potential witnesses.  It may be that it was understood that it was to be left to Ms Littler to procure their attendance at the right time so that Mr O'Sullivan could speak with them and determine whether they would assist, a course that would be far from ideal.  The precise circumstances are quite unclear, not least because Mr Quinn seems to have made few notes.    
Incompetence of counsel - principles
41The applicant maintains that he was of good character, that there were witnesses available to give evidence of that fact at the trial, one of whom (Ms Littler) gave evidence of that fact, but that that did not occur.  The applicant said that that gave rise to an unfair trial amounting to a miscarriage of justice, or alternatively to an irregularity that may have affected the result of the trial.  The applicant contended that the proviso had no application in either of those circumstances.
42The applicable principles have most recently been reviewed in this Court in Monteiro v R [2011] NSWCCA 113, PFC v R [2011] NSWCCA 275 and Winter v R [2013] NSWCCA 231.  All three judgments confirmed the continuing applicability of what Gleeson CJ had said in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683 and 685:
""As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case ... 
... As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence.
... However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.""
43The question ultimately is whether what occurred or did not occur at the trial occasioned a miscarriage of justice:  TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [79] (McHugh J);  Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; 214 ALR 1 at [18] (Hayne J); Matthews v R [2013] NSWCCA 187 at [62].  In TKWJ the High Court found there had been no miscarriage of justice where there had been a failure to adduce evidence of good character in a sexual assault trial, but in quite different circumstances from those present.  There the decision was made consciously so as to avoid what had been threatened by the Crown, namely, calling evidence of the complainant's sister about outstanding charges that had been laid against the accused which were to be the subject of a separate trial.  
44Gleeson CJ said (at [8]) that the decisions of trial counsel as to what evidence to call, or not to call, could ""rarely be the proper concern of appeal courts"".  Gaudron J, with whom Gummow and Hayne JJ agreed, said (at [29]) that failures by defence counsel had traditionally been said to involve ""flagrant incompetence"", ""egregious error"", ""extreme conduct"" or ""significant fault"", but noted that the ultimate question was that posed by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, namely, whether the act or omission resulted in a miscarriage of justice:  at [30]-[31].  McHugh J made the same point at [83], after saying at [79]:
""The critical issue in an appeal like the present is not whether counsel erred in some way but whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. However, 'whether counsel has been negligent or otherwise remiss ... remains relevant as an intermediate or subsidiary issue'. That is because the issue of miscarriage of justice in such cases ordinarily subsumes two issues. First, did counsel's conduct result in a material irregularity in the trial? Second, is there a significant possibility that the irregularity affected the outcome? Whether a material irregularity occurred must be considered in light of the wide discretion that counsel has to conduct the trial as he or she thinks best and the fact that ordinarily the client is bound by the decisions of counsel. Accordingly, 'it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence'. The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial.""
45McHugh J gave as an example at [85]:
""If counsel omits to call a material witness because of a memory lapse or a breakdown in communication and there is a significant possibility that the omission affected the outcome, the appellant will usually establish that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.""
46His Honour also said (and the applicant relied upon this) that in many such cases, the proviso was inapplicable:  see at [71] and [72].  Gaudron J dealt with the question of the proviso more concisely, but seemingly proceeded on the basis that the proviso could apply in the case where counsel's decisions had contributed to the miscarriage of justice:  at [25].  On the view that I take, it is unnecessary to address the question any further.  
47More recent decisions have emphasised that it is not ordinarily for the appellate court to review the decisions made by counsel at trial:  Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 162 A Crim R 301 at [8];  KLM at [51].   
Resolution of this application
48This is not an appeal.  It is an application for a substantial extension of time, unaccompanied by any cogent explanation for the delay, and supported by testimonial evidence that I have formed the view cannot safely be relied upon in key respects.  That of itself is not sufficient to resolve the application; in every case it remains necessary to consider the proposed appeal on its merits.  
49On the principal proposed ground of appeal, one is left with a very strong Crown case, key elements of which (the triple-O telephone call, the photographic evidence of the complainant's jeans, the complainant being found scarcely dressed in the early hours of the morning fleeing from the applicant, the medical evidence of her injuries and the evidence of the police officer who said he saw the applicant with a knife in his hand) make this very different from the paradigm ""word on word"" case of sexual assault where evidence of good character is especially important.  That said, I acknowledge that it has not been fully explained, almost three years later, whether character evidence was in fact available as a practical matter, if so, why it was not deployed, and what effect that failure had upon the trial.  This is not a case like Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142 where there was an unconvincing explanation for an extension of time but where also the Court was satisfied that the appeal would fail (see at [90]).  I would not go so far as to conclude that the Crown case was ""overwhelming"" or ""effectively unanswerable"";  cf Nudd at [20] and [159];  I do not think that this Court is in a position to reach that conclusion.
50However, I remain unpersuaded that the applicant has demonstrated that this is an appropriate case to extend time.  Although not hopeless, I do regard the principal ground as weak.  Moreover, its nature is of some importance.  This is not a case where some technical point is sought to be raised.  The failure to adduce character evidence was obvious on the face of the trial, and must have been immediately apparent to the applicant and Ms Littler.  This is emphatically not a case where one explanation for the delay is the need to assimilate the whole of the trial and bring to bear legal expertise.  Moreover, the delay itself has contributed to the lack of clarity as to why no character evidence was called.
51I do not consider that proposed ground 2 takes the matter any further.  In his ERISP the applicant had said that his telephone calls and text messages to the complainant (36 calls and 10 text messages that afternoon) were about whether the complainant would be home for dinner. He gave evidence on the voir dire that the complainant had threatened to abduct her children that night.  Although submissions were made about the failure to cross-examine about this, counsel was entitled to form the view that the best outcome on this issue which he could achieve was what was obtained, namely, a direction from the primary judge that the reason for the calls and texts was irrelevant.  I am not persuaded that the applicant has established that this was anything other than a forensic decision, the merits of which this Court cannot meaningfully review.  
52The applicant also pointed to the failure to put to the complainant very straightforward matters about which the applicant had spoken in his electronically recorded interview:  that she suffered depression, was not taking medication, was the subject of an earlier apprehended violence order and was having problems with her children.  All these would have been, it may be accepted, legitimate areas of cross-examination.  But it is impossible to form a meaningful view as to the impact the failure to do so had.  It may be that there was a forensic decision, in light of the way in which the complainant presented to the jury, and the other evidence in the Crown case, not to cross-examine on that basis.  
53The other matters complained of in proposed ground 2 are in essence complaints about the conduct of the defence by which the applicant is bound which fall short of something so significant that it amounts to a miscarriage of justice.  It is to be recalled that although it is not necessary to characterise the conduct as ""flagrant misconduct"" or ""egregious error"", it is also insufficient to establish that counsel has been ""negligent or otherwise remiss"".  To the extent that the question is whether the course taken by counsel was capable of explanation (see TKWJ at [27]-[28] and Nudd at [31] and [157]), that test would be satisfied.  
54Accordingly, I do not consider that proposed ground 2 materially alters the evaluation which is required (a view which reflects the emphasis given to proposed ground 1 when the matter was heard).  
55It must be borne in mind that every person is entitled to a fair trial, however strong the case against him or her may appear to be (and indeed, particularly where his or her case appears to be weak).  But this is not a case where the question is whether the proviso applies.  Nor is it an appeal.  The question here is whether there should be a substantial extension of time.  It is firmly established that the answer to that question has regard to the delay and the broader interest in the administration of justice as well as the strength of the case for which the extension of time is sought.  It is not necessary for the Crown to establish that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred.  It is necessary for the applicant to make out a proper case for a substantial extension of time.  
56I would have been minded to have granted the extension of time had the facts been as the applicant had sworn.  But having rejected the primary case he advanced, what remains in essence is an incompletely explained failure to call character evidence and some complaints about aspects of the way in which his defence was run.  For the reasons I have given, I have concluded that the proposed grounds of appeal, although not hopeless, are weak.
57Weighing up all of those considerations, I am not persuaded that the applicant has advanced a sufficiently arguable basis that there has been a miscarriage of justice to warrant the extension of time he seeks.  I propose that the extension of time be refused.
58JOHNSON J:  I agree with the judgment of Leeming JA and the order proposed by his Honour.  Further, I record my complete agreement with the factual findings made by Leeming JA with respect to the evidence called at the hearing of the application.  
59HALL J:  I agree with Leeming JA.

Before: McClellan CJ at CL

			Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with Basten JA.

2BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons of Basten JA and the orders his Honour proposes.

3BASTEN JA: On 19 June 2006 the applicant, Faheem Khalid Lodhi, was found guilty on three charges for offences under s 101 in Pt 5.3 of the Criminal Code (Cth) in relation to ""terrorist acts"". He is presently serving a sentence of imprisonment imposed by Whealy J on 23 August 2006. His appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed on 20 December 2007: Faheem Khalid Lodhi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 360. On 13 June 2008 an application for special leave to appeal was refused: Lodhi v The Queen [2008] HCA Trans 225. 

Application for investigation of juror
4On 10 January 2011 the solicitor then acting for the applicant wrote to the Sheriff of New South Wales, referring to the trial before Whealy J and stating:

""Information has since come to my attention that [a juror] had previously been diagnosed and treated for a mental health related illness. ... I have also been specifically informed that the delusions from which this juror suffered at times included paranoid delusions about being persecuted by terrorists. This information was not known during the trial, nor did the juror volunteer this information when the panel was informed about the nature of the charges. This now raises the question of whether this particular juror could be said to have been the subject of at least an apprehended bias, so as to lead to a possible miscarriage of justice. Indeed, it may also be that at the relevant time the juror was ineligible to serve as a juror, see s 6, clause 12, Schedule 2 Jury Act 1977.""

5The letter then requested the Sheriff, with the consent of the Supreme Court, to carry out an investigation pursuant to s 73A of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW). On 12 June 2011, in response to a request for further information, the solicitor stated his belief that the juror had also been admitted to a mental health unit after the completion of the trial.

6On 21 June 2012 the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal wrote to the solicitor advising that the Chief Judge at Common Law had ""considered this matter and determined not to request an investigation by the Sheriff"". That was the full effect of the letter: no reasons were provided. That, so far as this Court is aware, was the full extent of the correspondence: thus, no reasons were ever sought.

7On 18 July 2013 a summons was filed in this Court seeking leave to appeal from ""the whole of the decision below"" and, in the alternative, an order that ""the order made by McClellan CJ at CL on 21 June 2012, refusing to consent to an investigation by the Sheriff in accordance with s 73A Jury Act 1977, be quashed"". Further, consent under s 73A was sought from this Court.

Nature of application
8Section 73A of the Jury Act is a novel provision in this State, having commenced on 15 December 2004. It was enacted by the Jury Amendment Act 2004 (NSW). It is convenient to set out the section in full as it lies at the heart of the issues in this proceeding:

73A Investigation by sheriff of jury irregularities

(1) If there is reason (including a report under section 75C) to suspect that the verdict of a jury in a trial of any criminal proceedings may be, or may have been, affected because of improper conduct by a member or members of the jury, the sheriff may, with the consent of or at the request of the Supreme Court or District Court, investigate the matter and report to the court on the outcome of the investigation.

(2) Section 68A(1) does not prohibit the sheriff from soliciting information from a juror or former juror for the purpose of conducting such an investigation.

(3) Section 68B(1) does not prohibit a juror from disclosing information to the sheriff in connection with such an investigation.

(4) Section 139(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 applies in relation to any questioning conducted by the sheriff for the purpose of an investigation under this section (in the same way as it applies to official questioning by an investigating official).

(5) The sheriff may, despite sections 29 and 68, include a juror's name or other matter that identifies a juror in a report to the court under this section.

9The section confers power on the Sheriff, a State officer, subject to the consent or request of the relevant State court, to investigate any suspected ""improper conduct"" of a juror. It was appropriate for consent to be sought in this case from the Supreme Court, as the court which had conducted the trial. One issue, possibly relevant to the refusal of consent by the judge, is whether mental illness of a juror falls within the description of ""improper conduct"".

10Section 73A authorises an infringement of general law principles (as reflected in ss 29, 68, 68A and 68B of the Jury Act) governing the immunity of jurors from inquiry into their deliberations, and protection of their anonymity. There was no suggestion that an investigation under s 73A would infringe upon any essential characteristic of a trial by jury in a federal matter, protected by s 80 of the Constitution. Nor was it submitted that s 80 mandated any particular procedure to ensure that persons ineligible to serve as jurors were not empanelled. 

11The power of the Sheriff to conduct an investigation was not in issue; nor did the issue raised in the present case touch upon the deliberations of the jury. Rather, the proceedings were directed to the refusal by a judge of the Supreme Court to consent to the Sheriff's exercise of the statutory power. Further, the alternative forms of relief noted above reflected uncertainty on the part of the applicant as to whether the impugned decision was made in the exercise of judicial power or executive power. If not in the exercise of judicial power, the applicant accepted that there was no right of appeal under s 101 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW).

12A further issue raised in the applicant's summons was whether he required leave to institute the present proceedings, pursuant to s 4 of the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act 1981 (NSW). The Crown Advocate, appearing for the Attorney General of New South Wales, being the first respondent to the proceedings, conceded that such leave was not required but that, if it were required, it should be refused on the ground that the proceedings were bound to fail. For reasons which will be briefly explained below, the concession was correct.

13Underlying these issues was a fundamental question concerning the availability and source of any power of the kind sought to be exercised by the Sheriff. The applicant was convicted of an offence under federal law; his trial was undertaken in the exercise of federal jurisdiction. Being a trial on indictment for an offence against a law of the Commonwealth, he was entitled to be tried, and was tried, by a jury, in accordance with s 80 of the Constitution.

14The applicant's purpose underlying the request for an investigation by the Sheriff was to establish, if it were the fact, that the juror in question was either ineligible to sit on the jury which convicted him, or was otherwise biased in a way which gave rise to a miscarriage of justice. If either circumstance were established, as counsel indicated, the applicant would take any available steps to have his convictions set aside. Although his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal has already been determined and no further appeal is available, there remains the possibility that he could reagitate his application for special leave to appeal to the High Court (which was also rejected), or that he could invoke the executive powers available under Pt 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the Appeal and Review Act"") to have the matter referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, which would then be required to deal with it as an appeal.

15After dealing with the application under the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act, it is convenient to identify the nature of the decision made by the Chief Judge at Common Law, in order to determine the jurisdiction being exercised by this Court and the relief potentially available.

Application under Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act
16In Patsalis v State of New South Wales [2012] NSWCA 307 the Court accepted the State's concession that the applicant did not require leave under the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act in order to challenge the legality of his incarceration and his entitlement to obtain access to legal documents whilst in custody: at [1] and [7] (Allsop P), [112] (Sackville AJA); at [45]-[55] I gave reasons why I thought the concession was correct. The proceedings in the present case do not merely seek to challenge an exercise of public power by the State, they seek relief with respect to a decision of a judge of this Court which is seen to stand in the way of a possible challenge to the validity of certain criminal convictions. Leave is not required on the approach accepted in Patsalis.

17To the extent that the applicant seeks a request from this Court to the Sheriff, in the exercise of an administrative function, no proceedings are involved and accordingly the Felons (Civil Proceedings) Act is not engaged.

Nature of decision of Supreme Court
18The consent sought from the Supreme Court would, if granted, permit the Sheriff to carry out an investigation into suspected improper conduct by a member of a jury. The section is broad enough to cover proposed investigations both during and after a trial. The function exercised by the Supreme Court in requesting or consenting to an investigation may not be the same in each circumstance. Thus, where reason to suspect improper conduct arises during the course of a trial, so that steps can be taken before the jury delivers their verdict, the judge required to give consent or make a request to the Sheriff will almost certainly be the trial judge. The power so exercised will then constitute part of the conduct of the trial and will thus constitute, if not an exercise of judicial power, at least the exercise of a power ancillary or incidental to the exercise of judicial power.

19In the present case, where the trial has been completed, the jury having delivered their verdict, the function being exercised by the Court takes on a different colour. It is possible that, where an appeal remains on foot or available, that the further steps by the Supreme Court can properly be described as ancillary to the exercise of judicial power: see Petroulias v The Hon Justice McClellan [2013] NSWCA 434. However, that is not this case; this being a case where no right of appeal remains available. The most plausible relief available, if a basis for submitting that there had been a miscarriage of justice were to arise, is the exercise of various powers under Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act. That being so, the Court is not exercising either judicial power or a power ancillary to the exercise of judicial power. It is closer to the supervisory powers with respect to proposed intrusions by other members of the executive (such as police officers) through the issue of a warrant. It is not in doubt that the issue by a judge of a warrant will typically involve an administrative function: see, for example, Hilton v Wells [1985] HCA 16; 157 CLR 57; Love v Attorney-General (NSW) [1990] HCA 4; 169 CLR 307 at 321.

20In Ousley v The Queen [1997] HCA 49; 192 CLR 69 McHugh J stated at 100:

""Once the issuing of a warrant is classified as an administrative act, a person affected by that act may seek judicial review of it and have it declared void or set aside by an appropriate court or tribunal. Furthermore, since the prevailing theory is that an administrative act or order made outside jurisdiction is void, a litigant, affected by the act or order, may challenge it collaterally.""

21The warrant in Ousley was issued by a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria authorising installation and use of a listening device. The case involved collateral review of the validity of the warrant by a County Court judge conducting a criminal trial. Thus, Gaudron J stated at 87:

""Once it is accepted, as it must be, that, even though issued by the Supreme Court, a warrant ... is not a judicial order but an instrument made in the discharge of an administrative function, it follows that its validity may be challenged in collateral proceedings, no matter the court in which those proceedings are heard.""

22There were similar statements in the judgments of Toohey J at 80, Gummow J at 130 and Kirby J at 146. That analysis applies to the analogous circumstances of s 73A: accordingly, the power exercised by the Chief Judge at Common Law was an administrative power. It follows that there was no appeal from that decision: Patsalis v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 343 at [23]-[24].

23It also follows that, whilst judicial review of that decision may be available pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act, this Court will not be exercising federal jurisdiction in conducting such a review, unless some further basis for such jurisdiction is identified. That is because the outcome of the review will not affect rights or obligations which have been determined by the exercise of federal jurisdiction nor will the review be concerned with a matter arising under a federal law: cf LNC Industries Ltd v BMW (Australia) Ltd [1983] HCA 31; 151 CLR 575. No Commonwealth agency or officer is a party the proceedings.

24That conclusion raises two further questions. The first is whether, and if so on what grounds, the Court may quash or otherwise review the decision of the Chief Judge at Common Law. The second is whether, without taking that course, this Court could itself exercise the power under s 73A and grant or refuse consent to the request that the Sheriff investigate. With respect to the latter question, there is no reason to suppose the Court is functus officio when one judge has refused consent, but in any event the application in these proceedings can be seen as a further request for consent. It is, however, appropriate to deal first with the application for review because demonstration of error on the part of the judge who refused consent may be a significant consideration in the exercise by this Court of its own discretionary power.

Ground of review
25The primary ground of review relied upon by the applicant in written submissions, but not expanded upon in oral argument, was the failure of the primary judge to give reasons.

26In Wainohu v State of New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181, the High Court invalidated New South Wales legislation conferring an ""executive"" function on certain judges of the Supreme Court, because the legislation expressly excluded any obligation to give reasons for their non-judicial decisions: at [59] (French CJ and Kiefel J) and [104] and [109] (Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ). However, that conclusion should be understood in its statutory context.

27The majority judgments explained that the principle of institutional integrity, as a condition of constitutional validity of legislation conferring functions on a State Supreme Court, is not a function of the separation of powers, but of the requirement of an integrated national system of courts under Ch III of the Constitution: see, eg, [52] (French CJ and Kiefel J). Nevertheless, to define the essential characteristics of a court is to distinguish the court as an institution from other arms of government. So much follows from the reasoning in Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond [1986] HCA 7; 159 CLR 656, holding that administrative decision-makers are under no general law obligation to give reasons, absent a statutory requirement or some exceptional circumstance. 

28Further, there is no constitutional imperative at the State level to draw the functional boundaries between the different arms of government, as is necessary with respect to the executive and judicial arms under the federal Constitution. In the exercise of State jurisdiction no clear-cut categorisation is required and, indeed, the appropriate categorisation may depend upon the circumstances for which that exercise is undertaken: see Campbelltown City Council v Vegan [2006] NSWCA 284; 67 NSWLR 372 at [108]-[109]. Even in the federal arena, it has been possible to speak of powers exercised by judges performing administrative functions as ""quasi judicial in their nature"": Drake v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1979) 46 FLR 409 at 413 (Bowen CJ and Deane J, Smithers J agreeing), cited with apparent approval in Hilton v Wells by Gibbs CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ at 69; see also Mason and Deane JJ in Hilton v Wells at 84, describing certain functions of a magistrate as ""of a quasi judicial nature"". Although that language was not used in Wainohu, the description of the process undertaken by a judge in determining whether or not to make a declaration that a particular organisation is a declared organisation involved the trappings of the exercise of judicial power, other than the obligation to give reasons: at [66]-[68] (French CJ and Kiefel J) and at [91]-[92] in the joint reasons of Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ. The latter passage concluded that ""even if Pt 2 had entrusted the hearing and determination of applications thereunder to an administrator who is not a judge, there would be much to be said for the view that, in the absence of a contrary provision in Pt 2, this was one of those instances identified by Deane J in Public Service Board (NSW) v Osmond where there was to be discerned a statutory intent that the decision-maker was obliged to give reasons"": at [92]. 

29By contrast, as the joint reasons also noted and as has long been accepted, there are incidental and interlocutory decisions made in the course of a judicial proceeding which, even if made by a court, will not require the giving of reasons: at [98]. 

30The decision to refuse consent in the present case was made in circumstances which bore no comparison to the judicial functions of the Supreme Court. There was not, and it was not suggested that there should have been, any formal application by a party, any possibility of opposition, any hearing or, as already found, any right of appeal. The statute itself was silent as to whether reasons should be given. In these circumstances, it is not possible to infer from the silence of the statute, even where the power is conferred on a Supreme Court judge, that there was an obligation to give reasons for a refusal, at least in the absence of any request. If there had been a request, other considerations might have arisen which need not be considered in this case.

31There being no other basis for setting aside the decision of McClellan CJ at CL, prerogative relief should be refused.

Further application
32As noted above, this conclusion does not dispose of the matters raised by the applicant before this Court. It remains necessary to consider whether consent to the investigation by the Sheriff should nevertheless be granted. The relevant issues to be addressed are as follows:

(a) whether there is power to carry out an investigation with respect to a federal conviction (power);
(b) whether there are grounds which would warrant an investigation (grounds);
(c) the extent to which an investigation would entrench upon the privacy of jurors and the immunity of their deliberations from revelation (intrusion), and
(d) whether, assuming a particular reason for suspicion was found to have substance, there was some practical consequence which could follow (utility).

33In support of the further application, the applicant proffered further evidence. It is necessary to summarise that material. It is also necessary to note an issue which was raised in the course of the hearing before the Court as to its admissibility.

(a) nature and basis of suspicion
34The original material supplied to the Sheriff, referred to at [4] above, was contained in a letter from the applicant's then solicitor, Mr Michael Doughty, who practised in Moss Vale. The further material was contained in an affidavit of Ms Abigail Bannister of Pitt Street, Sydney, who is the applicant's current solicitor. Ms Bannister recounted telephone conversations with two counsel, who were named, and a solicitor who was the original source of the information supplied to Mr Doughty. She spoke to the solicitor, who was also named. The solicitor told Ms Bannister that a person (X) who had been known to her for many years had volunteered that he or she had recently served as a juror on the applicant's trial. The solicitor stated that to her knowledge X had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and suffered from paranoid delusions. The solicitor told Ms Bannister that X suffered ""from delusions of persecution by terrorists"". Ms Bannister further stated that she had asked the solicitor for a statutory declaration setting out the conversation they had had, but the solicitor had ultimately declined, citing her own poor health in justification of her refusal. 

35There is no evidence that this material was placed before the Sheriff, no doubt in part because the Supreme Court had already declined to consent to an investigation. However, the result is that the Sheriff has not sought further consent on the basis of the additional material. This Court may request the Sheriff to carry out an investigation in circumstances where the information has come to the Court otherwise than from the Sheriff, or where the Sheriff himself or herself has not proposed an investigation, if that course is otherwise appropriate.

36In considering this aspect of the matter, the Court is exercising an administrative function. Accordingly, no issue arises as to the admissibility of evidence or the form of the material. The only issue is whether the material is of sufficient substance to constitute ""reason to suspect"" within the terms of s 73A(1) and whether it should be investigated. 

37The material now presented, read with the earlier material, is of the kind that would invite investigation. Although the terms of the allegation are reasonably precise, there are questions of timing, credibility and reliability which demand further investigation before it would be possible to identify a potential miscarriage of justice. Given that the matter raised concerns as to the mental health of a person who is believed to have been a juror at the applicant's trial, it is an investigation which can only properly proceed beyond the stage to which it was taken by Ms Bannister if undertaken by the Sheriff with the approval of the Court. If the matters of fact which have been identified are found to have substance, the possibility that there has been a miscarriage of justice cannot be dismissed as fanciful. Accordingly there are grounds for an investigation, if the subject matter falls within the terms of s 73A.

38The matter raised by way of suspicion goes to the eligibility of the person who is believed to have served as a juror on the applicant's trial. The categories of persons ineligible to serve, as set out in Sch 2 of the Jury Act, include the holders of certain offices (which are readily identifiable, such as a judge or coroner) together with two other categories which are less readily assessed. One is that a person is ineligible if ""unable to read or understand English""; the other, being of present relevance, is a person who is unable ""because of sickness, infirmity or disability, to discharge the duties of a juror"": Sch 2, items 11 and 12 respectively.

39It is not necessary for present purposes to consider the precise scope of these factors, nor how they should be determined. It should be noted, however, that where a court, in the course of a trial, discovers that a juror was ""mistakenly or irregularly empanelled, whether because the juror was disqualified or ineligible to serve as a juror"", or became disqualified from serving or ineligible to serve or ""engaged in misconduct in relation to the trial"", the court is required to discharge the juror: s 53A(1). In that provision, ""misconduct"" means conduct that constitutes an offence against the Jury Act and ""any other conduct that, in the opinion of the court ..., gives rise to the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice in the trial"": s 53A(2). The court also has a power to discharge a juror if satisfied that ""the juror may not be able to give impartial consideration to the case because of ... any reasonably apprehension of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the juror or any similar reason"": s 53B. 

40While it is arguable that s 73A does not cover cases in which a person who was either disqualified or ineligible to serve as a juror in fact served, that would not prevent the court in which the trial was conducted, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of a trial, and, in the case of the Supreme Court, with respect to the administration of criminal justice generally, from requesting the Sheriff to make inquiries. As explained in R v Kaddour [2004] NSWCCA 361; 61 NSWLR 378, the court should be ""slow to construe legislation so that it prevents the court from taking what steps it should take to ensure that miscarriages of justice do not arise by reason of the identity of a juror and, perhaps, knowledge by a juror about a particular accused"", the latter being the issue in that case: at [23] (Spigelman CJ, Buddin J and Smart AJ agreeing). 

(b) power: relevance of federal conviction
41The trial of the applicant involved an exercise by the Supreme Court of federal jurisdiction. The primary source of law for the exercise of federal jurisdiction with respect to criminal proceedings is s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). That section relevantly provides that the laws of a State respecting the trial and conviction of an offender on an indictment and respecting the hearing and determination of ""appeals arising out of any such trial or conviction or out of any proceedings connected therewith"" shall apply to persons charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth: s 68(1). The term ""appeal"" is defined in s 2 of the Judiciary Act to include ""any proceeding to review or call in question the proceedings, decision or jurisdiction of any court or judge"". The proposed investigation, if it were to bear fruit, was intended to provide a basis for setting aside the convictions for federal offences. It is necessary to consider how that could occur.

42Unlike the rejection of the appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the refusal of the applicant's request for special leave to appeal to the High Court was not a final order in a proceeding inter partes and would not prevent the renewal of the application: Collins (alias Hass) v The Queen [1975] HCA 60; 133 CLR 120 at 122; Coulter v The Queen [1988] HCA 3; 164 CLR 350 at 356 (Mason CJ, Wilson and Brennan JJ) and at 360 (Deane and Gaudron JJ, dissenting, but not on this point). However, as a practical matter, the likelihood of the court granting an application to reopen is slight. As stated by Brennan J (for a Court comprising himself, Deane and McHugh JJ) in Cachia v St George Bank Ltd (1993) 68 ALJR 124, it is ""generally not appropriate for this Court to permit an applicant to have two opportunities to argue his case, the second on an application to reopen an earlier decision to refuse special leave"".

43In the present case, any ground of appeal relating to the ineligibility of a juror would raise an issue which had not been dealt with at trial, nor by the Court of Criminal Appeal. No doubt that would provide a possible basis for reopening an application dismissed when that ground was not available. But it is only an exceptional case in which the High Court is prepared to ""forego the assistance that the judgments of the [courts below] will provide if the matter reaches this Court"": Sanofi v Parke Davis Pty Ltd [No 1] [1982] HCA 9; 149 CLR 147 at 154 (Gibbs CJ, Stephen and Mason JJ). In any event, because the High Court deals with appeals in the strict sense of that term and not appeals by way of rehearing, that Court would not be able to address the factual issues which would arise: Mickelberg v The Queen [1989] HCA 35; 167 CLR 259 at 267 (Mason CJ), 274 (Brennan J) and 298 (Toohey and Gaudron JJ) although in respect of an appeal against a conviction in State jurisdiction.

44These factors would lead to the conclusion that there was a lack of utility in carrying out an investigation as proposed by the applicant, if the only purpose were to seek a reopening of his failed application for special leave to appeal.

45The alternative course identified by the applicant was that the investigation sought to be conducted by the Sheriff might constitute a step towards an inquiry under Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act. However, that raises a separate question as to whether such an inquiry is available in relation to the exercise of federal jurisdiction. 

46In order to consider that matter it is necessary to address briefly the terms of Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act. In substance, it contains two separate procedures by which an offender may seek review of, or an inquiry into, a conviction or sentence at any time, which includes at a time after appeal rights have been exhausted. (Indeed that is the time at which the provisions are usually called upon.) The first procedure involves a petition to the Governor for a review of a conviction or sentence in the exercise by the Governor of the pardoning power, which was an historical incident of the Royal prerogative: Appeal and Review Act, s 76. Petitions to the Governor may result in an inquiry conducted by a judicial officer or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW): s 77(1).

47The alternative course is to make an application to the Supreme Court for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence: s 78. If satisfied that there is ""a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case"", the Supreme Court may either direct an inquiry or refer the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal: s 79(1) and (2). Although a petition for executive clemency is dealt with by the Governor or the relevant Minister, in practice the same consequences flow and the same standard as to a relevant ""doubt or question"" is applied. 

48Somewhat ambiguously, s 79(4) states with respect to an application to the Supreme Court:

(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application.

49There are at least three separate ""proceedings"" referred to in s 79. These are:

(a) the consideration given to the application under s 78 by the Supreme Court;
(b) the inquiry by a judicial officer which may be directed by the Supreme Court, and
(c) a referral of the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act.

The second sentence in s 79(4) suggests that the only proceedings identified as being ""not judicial"" in the first sentence refer to the consideration given by the Supreme Court to the application, rather than any step which may result from that consideration. 

50Where either the Governor (under Div 2) or the Supreme Court (under Div 3) directs an inquiry by a judicial officer, the inquiry is undertaken pursuant to s 81 (in Div 4), which envisages the exercise of powers conferred by the Royal Commissions Act 1923 (NSW). It should therefore be characterised as an exercise of executive, rather than judicial power. By contrast, where the case is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal, it will be dealt with as an appeal by that Court, in the exercise of judicial power.

51Further, s 74(2) provides that, in Pt 7, ""a reference to a review of, or an inquiry into, a conviction or sentence includes a reference to a review of, or inquiry into, any aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence"". Although it is not necessary to decide the matter for present purposes, it may be assumed that an issue as to whether a juror was ineligible, and the consequences thereof, could be the subject of a review or inquiry.

52The next question is whether such a review or inquiry may be conducted in relation to a conviction for a federal offence. As the review or inquiry would not involve the exercise of judicial power, the terms of s 68 of the Judiciary Act are not engaged. Putting to one side a petition for executive clemency, it may be assumed that an application would be made to the Supreme Court in the event that the Sheriff's inquiries supported such a course. Again, the relevant inquiries having been undertaken, it is likely that the whole case would then be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be dealt with as an appeal. At that stage an exercise in judicial power would be engaged and, because the convictions were under a federal law, it would involve an exercise of federal jurisdiction. Once that point is reached, the terms of s 68(2) would be engaged: the definition of ""appeal"" being sufficiently broad to pick up State laws resulting in appellate proceedings in circumstances where the initial statutory right of appeal had been exhausted.

53That such inquiries have been undertaken with respect to federal convictions was noted by Wood CJ at CL in what appears to be the only analysis of the issue in this jurisdiction, Application of Pearson [1999] NSWSC 143; 46 NSWLR 148. Being satisfied that the power of inquiry provided by the predecessor s 79(1)(a) did not involve judicial power and therefore was not picked up by s 68 of the Judiciary Act, the Chief Judge held that such a process was not available but that the Supreme Court could refer the whole of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal: at [81]. Wood CJ at CL appears to have concluded that the power of the Supreme Court to consider an application, which could result in it referring the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, was a power incidental to the exercise of judicial power. However, for the reasons outlined above, that reasoning would not apply under the present legislation: the Supreme Court, under s 79(1), exercises an administrative function, which requires no authority under Commonwealth law unless and until a step is taken which could result in a review of, or call in question, the federal conviction.

54In R v Martens (No 2) [2009] QCA 351; 235 FLR 371; 262 ALR 106, the Queensland Court of Appeal (by a majority, Chesterman JA, Muir JA agreeing, Fraser JA dissenting) held that the Court had such jurisdiction under s 672A of the Criminal Code (Qld). That provision involved reference to the Court of Appeal of a petition for the exercise of the pardoning power by the State Governor. It was thus equivalent to a petition under Div 2 of the Appeal and Review Act and differs from the circumstances of the present case.

55Fraser JA expressed the view that s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act did not confer on the Governor-General, in the exercise of federal executive power, a power to refer a matter to a State court: at [38]. The doubts raised in respect of that power (which is reflected in Div 2 of Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act) do not directly apply to Div 3, dealing with applications to the Supreme Court for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence. Fraser JA's approach differs from the reasoning set above, which does not require a conferral of federal power to exercise an administrative power under State law.

56Of more direct relevance for present purposes, Fraser JA also concluded that, even though proceedings once referred to the Court of Appeal could constitute an appeal for the purposes of the Judiciary Act, they did not involve an appeal ""arising out of"" the trial and conviction of the offender, but rather involved a case ""arising out of a petition for mercy"": at [50]. That reasoning could apply to an application to the Supreme Court under Div 3 of the Appeal and Review Act. However, I am not persuaded that it is necessarily correct. There is no reason why the case could not be characterised as ""arising out of"" both the conviction and the petition, each being a necessary pre-condition to the appeal.

57For the majority, Chesterman JA identified the critical issue as ""whether s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act ... operates so as to confer (a) the power under s 672A of the Code to refer ... 'the consideration of any petition for the exercise of the pardoning power' ... on the Commonwealth Attorney-General; and (b) jurisdiction on the Court to hear a reference from the Commonwealth Attorney-General"". Both Chesterman JA and Muir JA (in their separate reasons) placed reliance on the definition of ""appeal"" in s 2 of the Judiciary Act as including ""any proceeding to review or call in question the proceedings, decision or jurisdiction of any court or judge"". Chesterman JA concluded that ""the proceeding which follows a reference to the Court pursuant to s 672A is an appeal and is to be determined as an appeal against conviction (or sentence)"" and accordingly s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act conferred the relevant jurisdiction on the State court: at [84].

58Chesterman JA then considered a second objection, namely that s 68 did not pick up and confer on the Commonwealth Governor-General the executive power, on consideration of a petition, to refer the whole case to the Court. The conclusion that it did have that effect was derived from statements in various High Court judgments to the effect that if s 68(2) were to confer on an appellate court a right of appeal enjoyed under State law by a prosecutor, it would have to operate so as to allow a Commonwealth prosecutor to invoke the jurisdiction. It is not necessary, for present purposes, to determine whether the analogy is sound.

59The question is how, if at all, those powers could be picked up and applied in support of a proceeding, as yet uncommenced, in federal jurisdiction. That would appear to depend upon the construction of s 68 as picking up procedures incidental to the exercise of federal jurisdiction, albeit in the exercise of executive power.

60In a matter in the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions appeared for the respondent in proceedings analogous to those under Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act, but ""expressly conceded"" that the Court had jurisdiction to entertain a reference from the Commonwealth Attorney: R v Collie (CCA (Vic), 18 December 1992, unrep). 

61It is understandable that a court considering whether it has jurisdiction in a federal matter should look to the scope and effect of s 68 of the Judiciary Act. However, it does not follow from the fact that a matter is before the court, that all steps along the way must be supported by the operation of s 68. Rather the administrative steps, if involving coercive powers, may be sourced in State law. It is only where some step has a potential effect on a federal conviction that a federal source of power is required.

62The jurisdiction which this Court is called upon to exercise is, however, at one remove from a direct challenge to the conviction for a federal offence. This Court is being asked to review a decision by the Chief Judge with respect to the instigation of an inquiry which will not, of itself, affect the applicant's convictions. In addition, it is itself being asked to exercise the power of request or consent under the Jury Act. 

63Any step which had a direct effect on a conviction would involve an exercise of judicial power and fall outside the category of executive procedures which were the subject of consideration in Crump v State of New South Wales [2012] HCA 20; 247 CLR 1; Elliott v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; 234 CLR 38 at [5]; cf Baker v The Queen [2004] HCA 45; 223 CLR 513 at [32]-[33]. Because no party argued to the contrary, it should be accepted that the State law applied of its own force with respect to the powers of the Sheriff and the executive power conferred on the Supreme Court. 

64The question arising in the present case does not directly involve the possible means by which the applicant could challenge his conviction, if a sufficient basis were established. Rather, it concerns the means by which such a basis might be established and, in particular, the exercise by the Supreme Court and the Sheriff of powers which are, it is accepted, non-judicial. 

(c) intrusion on juror's privacy
65Part of the general law protection of jurors extended to the rule that a juror could not give evidence which might impugn a verdict. In Ellis v Deheer [1922] 2 KB 113 Atkin LJ explained at 121:

""The reason why that evidence is not admitted is twofold, on the one hand it is in order to secure the finality of decisions arrived at by the jury, and on the other to protect the jurymen themselves and prevent their being exposed to pressure to explain the reasons which actuated them in arriving at their verdict.""

66That principle did not, however, prevent evidence being taken from a juror that he (and, later, she) did not have a sufficient understanding of English to follow the trial: Ras Bahari Lal v The King-Emperor (1933) 50 TLR 1 at 2 (Atkin LJ). The result of these and other cases, discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Emmett (1988) 14 NSWLR 327, show that the result of an inquiry into some impropriety, not revealing the deliberations of the jury, could be admitted on appeal and the verdict might be set aside: Ras Bahari Lal and Emmett itself; see also Re Portillo [1997] 2 VR 723 (Callaway JA, Southwell and Coldrey AJJA agreeing) directing that steps be taken to identify evidence of improper communications between the jury keeper and jurors, with the intent that such material be available on an application for leave to appeal. 

67At the heart of the reasoning of the Court in Emmett was the proposition that the jury verdicts were irregularly obtained in circumstances where the Sheriff's officers illegally and improperly communicated with the jury in ways explained by Lee J at 329-330. He continued, at 331, referring to references to the Crown Prosecutor and the judge:

""They were harmless references, as I see them, and although in strictness a sheriff's officer should refrain from any personal comment about the crown prosecutor, the judge or counsel or anyone else, including witnesses involved in the trial, I do not consider that they play any part in the result of this appeal. But the balance of the allegations are of real significance. They imply that pressure was being put upon jurors by the sheriff's officer Bob to reach a verdict, that that sheriff's officer and possibly the sheriff's officers Kay and Tom took part in discussion with the jury about the case and that Bob and Kay expressed an opinion that the accused were guilty.""

68Lee J concluded at 335:

""For the Court not to inquire into the matter would be for the Court to condone the exposure of the jury to influence in arriving at its verdict by the very persons entrusted to ensure that the jury shall conduct is deliberations only with all jurors present, in secrecy, in private and free from opinions or pressure from anyone whether connected with the trial or not. To say that jurors could not reveal misconduct by sheriff's officers in the jury room would for all practical purposes be to say that no one can reveal misconduct of sheriff's officers in the jury room.""

69Lee J held that at least two jurors were ""influenced to arrive at the verdict of guilty by the conduct of the sheriff's officer"": 336D. Enderby J stated at 339C:

""In my judgment it is not essential to prove that the jurors, or some of them, were actually influenced by what happened. It is enough for there to be a real suspicion that they may have been so influenced. On the facts of this case I accept that at least two jurors were influenced.""

70Grove J agreed with Lee J, although he did not accept that the comments regarding the prosecutor and the judge were inconsequential.

71The Jury Act contains a number of prohibitions on disclosure. First, there is a prohibition on disclosure of any information likely to lead to the identification of a juror, which is subject to an exception with respect to the disclosure of information by the Sheriff, including to a court, ""for the purposes of an investigation or prosecution of a contempt of court or an offence relating to a juror or jury"": s 68(1) and (4).

72Sections 68A and 68B prohibit the solicitation of information from a juror and the disclosure of information by a juror or former juror about:

(a) the deliberations of a jury, or
(b) how a juror, or the jury, formed any opinion or conclusion in relation to an issue arising in a trial or coronial inquest: s 68A(1), s 68B(1) and (2).

73In Emmett, Grove J noted that the evidence ""in its peripheries had the result of exposing not only the matter of interaction between the keepers and the jury but as an incidental of some of the activity amongst the jury inter se"": at 340G. He further noted at 341:

""The community's intent in protecting jurors from harassment after their service has been made explicit in the Jury Act 1977, ss 68 and 68A. The result of this appeal should not be seen as derogatory of that intent and cannot be taken to condone or in someway licence the pursuit and interview of jurors after a verdict has been returned simply as an investigating process undertaken by a disappointed litigant.""

74The Court in Emmett may not have found it necessary to consider the operation of ss 68 and 68A as, in their present form, they did not commence until 15 January 1988. The relevant disclosures may have been made before that time. One question in the present case may be whether inquiries made by the Sheriff with or without the consent of the Court, would fall within the prohibition in s 68. If they would, the prohibition is lifted by s 73A(5).

75In the present case, the investigations proposed by the applicant would not intrude upon or reveal the deliberations of the jury. They would invade the privacy of a specific juror (if he or she could be identified), but that course is justified if a real issue as to qualification or eligibility is raised.

76The applicant asserted that the information supplied raised a suspicion that one of the jurors may have been unable ""because of sickness, infirmity or disability, to discharge the duties of a juror"", being item 12 in Sch 2 of the Jury Act identifying persons ineligible to serve as jurors. He contended that if a juror were ineligible at the time of trial, it would be open to him to argue that a miscarriage had been occasioned which would require the conviction to be set aside, referring to R v Petroulias [2007] NSWCCA 134; 73 NSWLR 134.

77The Jury Act distinguishes between persons who are ""disqualified from serving as jurors"" and persons who are ""ineligible to serve as jurors"". Petroulias was concerned with a person who was disqualified, it having been discovered in the course of the trial that one of the jurors was subject to a court order disqualifying him from driving a motor vehicle, a ground of disqualification provided in Sch 1, item 3. It is not necessary to consider whether the reasoning of the majority (Simpson J, Hoeben J agreeing) in Petroulias was correct, nor whether it would apply to an ineligible juror. The applicant was content to rely upon the fact that it was ""open"" to him to argue that a miscarriage had been occasioned.

78Secondly, he submitted that it would be arguable that, if the juror did have a level of paranoia as to persecution by terrorists, it might be concluded that a fair-minded and informed observer would hold a reasonable apprehension of lack of impartiality of the part of that juror, in accordance with the test articulated in Webb v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; 181 CLR 41 at 47 (Mason CJ and McHugh J), at 57 (Brennan J), and at 69 (Deane J).

79The submissions should be accepted: they demonstrate that an investigation would not lack utility.

Conclusions
80The Court should make the following orders:

(1) Dismiss the summons seeking leave to appeal from the decision of McClellan CJ at CL as incompetent.
(2) Dismiss the summons seeking review pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 of the decision of McClellan CJ at CL.
(3) In the exercise of its power under s 73A of the Jury Act 1977, and such other jurisdiction as may be available in the administration of criminal justice, the Court requests the Sheriff to investigate whether a member of the jury which convicted the applicant of charges under the Criminal Code (Cth) in June 2006 may have been ineligible to serve as a juror pursuant to Sch 2, item 12 of the Jury Act 1977.

			Judgment
1BATHURST CJ:  I agree with Basten JA.
2BEAZLEY P:  I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the judgment of Basten JA.  I agree with the conclusion of his Honour at [57] and his reasons for reaching that conclusion.  I also agree that the application before the Court should be dismissed.  
3I wish, however, to make the following short observations.  Basten JA, at [15]-[30], has expressed a preference for the view that McClellan CJ at CL, in refusing the applicant's request for an investigation under the Jury Act 1977, s 73A was undertaking a judicial function.  In this regard, his Honour has indicated, at [26], that the power exercised by his Honour arguably fell within the powers conferred by the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 12.  Section 12 makes provision for the supplemental powers that may be exercised by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Section 22(1) provides that the powers conferred by s 12 may be exercised by a judge sitting alone.  
4The powers conferred by s 12 include:  the power to order the production of any document, exhibit, or other thing connected with the proceedings:  para (a);  and the power to order persons who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined:  para (b).  However, the exercise of such powers is different from the function of the judge under s 73A, as is apparent from the terms subs (1), which provides: 
""73A Investigation by sheriff of jury irregularities
(1) If there is reason (including a report under section 75C) to suspect that the verdict of a jury in a trial of any criminal proceedings may be, or may have been, affected because of improper conduct by a member or members of the jury, the sheriff may, with the consent of or at the request of the Supreme Court or District Court, investigate the matter and report to the court on the outcome of the investigation.""
5In my opinion, the function of a judge under by the Jury Act, s 73A does not readily fall within the supplemental powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal contained in s 12.  If I am correct in this, the consent or direction given by a judge under s 73A does not bear the hallmarks of a judicial function.  However, as the proper outcome in this case does not necessarily require that the nature of the decision be classified as either judicial (or incidental to the judicial function) or administrative, I do not express a final view on that question. 
6BASTEN JA:  In December 2007 the applicant, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, was found guilty of two offences under the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  The trial was conducted in the Supreme Court, before Johnson J and a jury.  Because the offences arose under a law of the Commonwealth, the Court was exercising federal jurisdiction.
7On 20 June 2008 the applicant was sentenced by Johnson J to an overall term of imprisonment of three years and two months commencing on 20 June 2008 and expiring on 19 August 2011.  A non-parole period of two years was fixed, which expired on 19 June 2010.  
8Although the sentences have now been served, the applicant's application for leave to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal has yet to be heard.  (This Court is not apprised of the reasons for that extraordinary delay.)
Application for investigation of conduct of jurors9On 24 March 2009 the applicant's solicitors received a letter from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions attaching a copy of an internet blog which appears to have commenced at the time of the applicant's conviction and continued until 28 August 2008.  In printed form, it extends over some 30 pages.  It contains material which, in part, purports to reflect a discussion of the merits of the convictions, some of the views purporting to be from persons on the jury.  (Part of the material related to the sentencing proceedings and part to an entirely different case.)
10Some 17 months after receiving that letter, on 19 August 2010, the solicitor for the applicant wrote to the Sheriff requesting him to investigate whether there had been improper conduct by members of the jury, pursuant to s 73A of the Jury Act 1977 (NSW).  The Sheriff is empowered to take such a step, but only with the consent of or at the request of the Supreme Court (or District Court).  On 5 October 2010 the Sheriff wrote to the Registrar of the Supreme Court, asking if the Court wished the Sheriff to investigate.  On 13 October 2010 the Registrar replied in the following terms:
""The Chief Judge at Common Law has considered the matters raised in your letter and the related documents provided.  He determined not to request an investigation in this matter.""
11On 16 November 2010 the applicant wrote to both the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal and to the associate to McClellan CJ at CL seeking confirmation of the decision and asking whether there would be ""reasons for the decision"".  On 24 November the Registrar replied confirming the decision not to request an investigation and stating that the Chief Judge had not given reasons.
12On 9 February 2011 the applicant commenced proceedings in the Common Law Division, naming the Chief Judge as the defendant, and seeking an order quashing his decision not to consent to an inquiry, seeking a declaration that there was reason to suspect that the verdict may have been affected by improper conduct by the jury and, finally, an order that the Sheriff conduct such an investigation.  (It is not necessary to inquire whether the defendant was properly named: no doubt to name the institution, the Supreme Court, would have highlighted the jurisdictional difficulties faced by the applicant.)
13Although, in analogous circumstances, an application to review what was taken to be an administrative decision by the head of a jurisdiction, was brought by way of judicial review before a single judge of the Court, at least in this Court, such a process is inapt: cf Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) v Eastman (2002) 130 A Crim R 588.  (No doubt reflecting older understandings of the availability of judicial review, s 48 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) does not provide for proceedings relating to a decision of a judge of the Court, but the structure of the Court makes it apt for the proceedings to be heard in the Court of Appeal.)  The proceedings were ultimately removed to this Court.  They were listed for hearing with another matter raising similar issues, judgment in which is to be handed down contemporaneously with this judgment: Lodhi v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 433.  
14The two cases involve a number of common issues.  There are, however, two respects in which the cases are materially different.  First, Mr Lodhi had exhausted his rights of appeal.  He was dependent upon an exercise of executive discretion, or a further non-judicial inquiry, in order to maintain proceedings which could affect his convictions and sentences.  The applicant still has an appeal on foot, unresolved, in the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Secondly, Mr Lodhi's concern related to the eligibility of a member of the jury who may have suffered from a disabling mental condition.  An investigation into that matter required no reference to the deliberations of the jury, nor to the possible consequences of the disability, if shown to have substance, on the actual deliberations.  By contrast, the investigation sought by the applicant is primarily directed to the conduct of the jury during the trial and in the course of deliberations.  These factors raise issues which did not need to be addressed (and were not addressed) in the matter of Lodhi.
Nature of decision under s 73A15The submissions of the parties proceeded on the basis that it was necessary to characterise the power being exercised by McClellan CJ at CL as either judicial or administrative.  If it were judicial, it was assumed that it was either part of or ""incidental to"" the criminal proceedings which involved an exercise of federal jurisdiction.  In that event, the law to be applied was federal law, which included State laws relevantly picked up for the purpose by s 68 of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth).  The question then was whether those laws included s 73A of the Jury Act.  In the event that there was an exercise of federal jurisdiction and it included the consideration of powers conferred by s 73A of the Jury Act, the next question was whether this Court could, in the exercise of judicial review pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act, consider the correctness of the decision of a judge of the Court not to request an investigation.
16If the power conferred by the Jury Act were merely administrative, and McClellan CJ at CL was exercising such a power, but not in his judicial capacity, different questions arose.  The provisions of the Judiciary Act did not render s 73A applicable with respect to the exercise by the jury of its functions under federal law.  (A non-judicial power will not engage the legislative power of the Commonwealth under s 77(iii) of the Constitution to invest a State court with ""federal jurisdiction"", which is the provenance of ss 39(2), 68, 79 and 80 of the Judiciary Act.) Thus, absent any federal law picking up s 73A, the next question is whether such a provision of State law could operate of its own force with respect to a determination made in the exercise of federal judicial power.  
17The engagement of the Sheriff to conduct investigations into allegations of jury misconduct was not a function which commenced with the enactment of s 73A, in 2004.  That is illustrated by the judgment in R v Kaddour [2004] NSWCCA 361; 61 NSWLR 378.  In that case the applicant sought to identify a juror as a person who knew him and held adverse views regarding his character and reputation: at [2] (Spigelman CJ).  Certain inquiries were made by the Sheriff, who supplied information to a single judge in the Common Law Division (Dunford J).  Dunford J refused the applicant's request that the material obtained by the Sheriff be disclosed to the applicant, a course which Dunford J held was precluded by s 68 of the Jury Act.  (There was no discussion as to whether Dunford J was sitting as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal when he made the order.)  The report describes the proceedings as an appeal from a decision of Dunford J.  Spigelman CJ held that s 68(4) of the Jury Act  ""limited as it is to contempt and an offence relating to a jury, does not encompass the full range of circumstances in which the identity of the juror can give rise to the need for disclosure in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice"": at [22].  
18The source of the Sheriff's power of inquiry and report was not discussed, but it may be an implied power necessary for the proper administration of criminal justice through trial by jury.  Thus it may be inherent in the concept of a jury trial provided for in federal jurisdiction by s 80 of the Constitution.  If the power is not at least incidental to the exercise of federal jurisdiction there is no evident basis (none was identified by counsel) to apply a State law to affect a conviction made in federal jurisdiction.  A State law cannot alter, impair or detract from the operation of the law of the Commonwealth supporting the conviction: Constitution, s 109.  On the other hand, the power exercised by the Sheriff only impairs the privacy of jurors; any effect given to the consequent report will occur in the exercise of judicial power.  Similarly, any direction (or consent) given to the Sheriff will not affect the prior exercise of federal jurisdiction.  
19Secondly, while this Court might have judicial review jurisdiction, under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act, to police the constitutional limits of the State Supreme Court, and to set aside any decision made by a judge in excess of power - compare Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531 - if s 73A were an available source of power as State law, the question is whether, under s 69, this Court can review a decision of a judge of the Court made in the exercise of an administrative function.  (A similar question was referred to, but not resolved, in relation to an application for executive clemency, in Osland v Secretary, Department of Justice (Vic) [2008] HCA 37; 234 CLR 275 at [47].)
20In Momcilovic v The Queen [2011] HCA 34; 245 CLR 1, the High Court considered the nature and validity of a power conferred on the Supreme Court of Victoria by the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic) to make a declaration of inconsistency with respect to a statutory provision and its compatibility with identified human rights and freedoms.  The Court divided as to the proper characterisation of such a power and as to its validity.  French CJ (with whom Bell J agreed) concluded that the function was neither a part of the judicial function nor was it incidental to the exercise of judicial power: at [89] and [91].  Nevertheless, that conclusion was found not to be fatal to its validity because of incompatibility with the institutional integrity of the State court: at [92].  As it did not involve an exercise of judicial power, the Chief Justice held that the provision was not picked up by s 79 of the Judiciary Act: at [100].  He continued at [101]:
""Accepting the validity of s 36, there is no reason in principle why the Court of Appeal, having exhausted its functions in the exercise of its federal jurisdiction in this case, could not proceed to exercise the distinct non-judicial power, conferred upon it by s 36, to make a declaration of inconsistent interpretation""
21Gummow J (with whom Hayne J agreed) held that the power did not involve an exercise of the judicial function, nor was it incidental to the exercise of strictly judicial powers: at [184] and [187].  Gummow J considered that it was incompatible with the exercise of judicial power by the State Supreme Court and was, therefore, invalid: at [188].  Heydon J agreed, though for somewhat different reasons, that s 36 was invalid.
22Crennan and Kiefel JJ concluded that, whilst the power was not strictly judicial, it was to be exercised as an incident of judicial power: at [592].  They further considered whether it might yet involve a function ""so incompatible with the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth that the integrity of the judiciary may thereby be diminished"": at [595], paraphrasing the judgments of Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ in Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51.  They rejected that argument.
23No question of incompatibility was raised in the present case.  Nor was the reasoning in Momcilovic directly applicable: the question of whether the function was incidental to an exercise of judicial power was to be assessed, not by reference to the conduct of the trial, but by reference to the extant and unresolved appeal.
24In a letter of 16 November 2010 to the Registrar, Court of Criminal Appeal, the applicant stated:
""As you will be aware, I am preventing [sic] from finalising the submissions and obtaining a date for the appeal because a fundamental aspect to it is the evidence that arises of jury misconduct from the 'jury blog'.
I attach a fax letter to the Associate of McClelland J [sic] seeking necessary information for pursuing the next step in obtaining such information.  I cannot further the completion of the submissions until this fundamental issue is exhausted.
The delay this is unfortunately, disadvantageous to me alone.""
25It may be inferred from this material that the applicant intended to place the outcome of any investigation undertaken by the Sheriff before the Court of Criminal Appeal in support of his application for leave to appeal under s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  The nature of the request was therefore analogous to a request to issue a subpoena or notice to produce in the course of proceedings.  Accordingly, the applicant submitted, the refusal by the Chief Judge was an interlocutory decision in those proceedings.  That was said to have two consequences: first, the Chief Judge should have given reasons for his refusal, when requested to do so.  Secondly, the applicant had a right of appeal, albeit by leave, to the Court of Appeal.  That was because, although the refusal was incidental to the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in a criminal matter, it was a decision of a judge of the Court in a Division, for the purposes of s 101 of the Supreme Court Act, and was not excluded from the operation of the Act as a criminal proceeding referred to in s 17 of the Act and in the Third Schedule.
26The first step in relation to the asserted right of appeal to this Court is doubtful: if an interlocutory step were being undertaken in relation to a criminal appeal, it would seem that the judge was exercising a jurisdiction incidental to that appeal and was not making an order of ""the Court in a Division"" for the purposes of s 101(1)(a).  Further, because the reference in Schedule 3, paragraph (d), to ""proceedings in the Court under the Criminal Appeal Act of 1912"" is apt to include interlocutory decisions in the course of such proceedings, the Court of Appeal would not be the appropriate forum to hear an appeal from such decision.  Although there is no express power in the Criminal Appeal Act allowing that Court to review interlocutory decisions, it is arguable that the power to request the Sheriff to conduct an inquiry falls within the powers conferred by s 12(d) of the Criminal Appeal Act and can be exercised by a judge sitting alone: s 22(1).  (Thus s 12(d) empowers the Court ""where any question arising on the appeal involves ... any scientific or local investigation, which cannot ... be conveniently conducted by the court [to] refer the question for inquiry and report to a commissioner appointed by the court..."".)  Section 22(2) provides that ""[i]f the judge refuses an application on the part of the appellant to exercise any such power in the appellant's favour, the appellant is entitled to have the application determined by the court"", namely the Court of Criminal Appeal, constituted by three judges, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Act, s 3(1).  
27Assuming that the refusal to order an investigation, under s 73A was made by the Chief Judge as a judge of the Court of Criminal Appeal, that decision was subject to reconsideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal: Criminal Appeal Act, s 22(2).  Against the possibility that this Court might be required to exercise such jurisdiction, the members of the Court were appointed to constitute a Court of Criminal Appeal for the purposes of the hearing, as noted by the Chief Justice (Tcpt, 02/08/13, p 2(10)).  
28Assuming that the power to order (and refuse to order) an investigation was incidental to an extant appeal, there is no reason to suppose that the power to make such an order was not picked up and applied in federal jurisdiction by s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act.  The same principle would apply to the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court, which was otherwise exercising federal jurisdiction in any event, because of an argument by the applicant that the inquiry was necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of s 80 of the Constitution.
29If McClellan CJ at CL were indeed exercising judicial power, albeit in respect of an interlocutory application, he should have given reasons for his decision, once it was clear that the applicant was seeking reasons.  However, it does not follow that his decision should be set aside if it were held to be correct in any event.
30Although the process before this Court was not as clearly identified as in Lodhi, the appropriate course to be taken in these circumstances is for this Court to exercise its powers as the Supreme Court, for the purposes of s 73A of the Jury Act, or as the Court of Criminal Appeal, if indeed the interlocutory order were one made in the exercise of that jurisdiction.  On either view, it is necessary to consider the merit of the application, as has been done in Lodhi.
Nature of application31It is convenient to start with a brief reference to the general law principles which apply to the conduct of jurors during the course of a criminal trial.  They were helpfully summarised by Gleeson CJ (James and Ireland JJ agreeing) in Minarowski and Koziol (1995) 83 A Crim R 78.  That case, which like the present, lasted for several weeks, resulted in the appellants being convicted of possession of not less than the trafficable quantity of heroin.  As explained by the Chief Justice, the grounds of appeal had ""nothing to do with the respective merits of the Crown and defence cases"": at 79.  Rather, three incidents were relied upon as demonstrating a miscarriage, two of which came to the attention of the Court during the course of the trial.  The first two incidents involved casual conduct between a juror and a person associated with the prosecution: the contact was found to be harmless.
32The third came to attention only after the trial was completed, when police, a solicitor instructing the prosecutor and the prosecutor himself were party to a conversation with three jurors in which they were told that a juror, wanting to understand better the nature of an unsworn statement and why the accused were not cross-examined on it, had obtained and taken into the jury room a magazine article which explained such matters, and was critical of the use then made of unsworn statements.  Of this incident Gleeson CJ stated at 84:
""Leaving to one side the hearsay nature of the evidence upon which the appellants rely, which is not a point taken by the Crown, the appellants are confronted by a difficulty arising out of the principles which govern the approach taken by appellate courts towards attempts to prove matters relating to the deliberations of a jury.
It is settled law that after a jury's verdict has been formally delivered a juror may not seek to impugn the verdict. ...  
As the above passages show, the considerations of the need to preserve the findings of verdicts and the need to protect the secrecy of jurors' deliberations (which involves the encouragement of frank discussion between jurors, and protects them from intimidation and harassment during and after the trial) are distinct but interrelated, and the refusal to allow a juror to impugn a verdict after it has been delivered is only one aspect of a wider principle ....
The principle, based upon considerations of public policy, that a court will not receive from a juror evidence of what was discussed between jurors in the course of their deliberations, cannot be circumvented by tendering evidence of a hearsay measure, being evidence of what a juror has said about a juror's deliberations to a third party.""
33The Chief Justice continued at 85:
""A distinction has been drawn between evidence, first-hand or hearsay, as to the deliberations of a jury and evidence, sometimes described as relating to 'extrinsic matters', which proves a material irregularity in the proceedings.  Thus, for example, it is permissible to lead evidence to show that inadmissible and prejudicial material of an evidentiary nature was sent into a jury room and was available to be considered by the jury (Rinaldi (1993) 30 NSWLR 605 ...), or that a sheriff's officer wrongly intruded into the jury's deliberations and expressed a view that the accused were guilty (Emmett (1988) 14 NSWLR 327 ...), or that a jury bailiff suggested to a jury that an accused had previous convictions (Brandon (1969) 53 Cr App R 466), or that a juror was drunk, or could not speak English, or refused to participate in deliberations (Tuia [1994] 3 NZLR 553).""
34Gleeson CJ noted that ""the dividing line between proof of a jury's deliberations and proof of an irregularity in the proceedings may, as the present case illustrates, be difficult to draw"".
35It is convenient to refer to Tuia v R [1994] 3 NZLR 553.  The judgment of the New Zealand Court of Appeal (constituted by McKay and Tipping JJ and Sir Gordon Bisson), delivered by Tipping J, explained the issue in the following terms:
""The appellant killed his wife.  He was tried for her murder and found guilty.  The jury did not accept his plea of insanity.  One of the medical witnesses, Dr French, brought with him to court the appellant's medical records in the form of two linked files totalling over 100 pages.  The file ... contained a comprehensive day-by-day record of the appellant's diagnosis, progress and treatment during his time in hospital after the killing.  It also contained notes of what the appellant had said to various people.
The file was not produced as an exhibit for obvious reasons.  It was, however, left behind in court by Dr French in case any subsequent medical witnesses wished to refer to it.  When the jury retired to consider their verdict the file went by mistake with the exhibits into the jury room.  It was available to the jury throughout their deliberations ....  The fact that the file had been in the jury room did not come to light until a day or so after the verdict had been delivered.  The matter was mentioned by a juror to her neighbour.  The point was then brought to the attention of the court.  The information presently available does not enable this Court to decide whether the file or any part of it was in fact read by any juror.""
36The Court upheld the appeal and declined to apply the proviso, on the basis that the inadmissible material ""could"" have influenced the verdict.  The Court considered whether there was an exception to the rule that courts not receive evidence from jurors purporting to disclose what had taken place during their deliberations, if there were a sufficiently compelling reason to do so.  The question arose because the prosecutor had sought a direction from the Court authorising the jurors to be asked whether the file was in fact examined.  Whilst acknowledging that such a step might be taken in an exceptional case, the Court did not consider such an investigation should be undertaken in that case. 
37Section 73A is a statutory resolution of the problem and was introduced after Minarowski was determined.  It was in fact introduced as part of a package of amendments, which included s 68B (prohibiting jurors from disclosing to any person during the trial information about their deliberations) and s 68C (prohibiting a juror from making inquiries which might elicit extrinsic material in relation to the case).  The Second Reading Speech for the Jury Amendment Act 2004 (NSW) said the proposed legislation was a response to two major Supreme Court criminal trials in which convictions had been overturned because the verdicts of the juries had been tainted by misconduct, referring to R v K [2003] NSWCCA 406; 59 NSWLR 431 and R v Skaf [2004] NSWCCA 37; 60 NSWLR 86.  As the Minister explained (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 27 October 2004 at 12096):
""There are three main legislative provisions to these amendments.  Firstly, the Bill creates a new offence of jurors conducting their own inquiries.  Secondly, the Bill expands the scope of the current offences of soliciting information from a juror and jurors disclosing information.  Thirdly, and importantly, the Bill empowers the office of the sheriff to investigate jury irregularities and report back to the Court.""
38The Act also included a new s 55DA, which allowed a judge to examine a juror on oath to determine whether the juror had engaged in conduct prohibited by s 68C.  
39In R v K, Wood CJ at CL (with whom Grove and Dunford JJ agreed) stated:
""54 Upon balance, I have reached the conclusion that evidence concerning the fact of the internet searches and the nature of the information which had been gathered by the three jurors who had made the search, should be received, by analogy with the cases where evidence has been received to the effect that documents, which were not in evidence in the trial, had found their way to the jury room.  ...
55 I do not, however, consider, consistently with the authorities mentioned, that the Court should have regard to any discussion between jurors concerning that material, or to any evidence concerning the effect which it may or may not have had on their deliberations.  To extend the inquiry that far would appear to me to offend against the long established rule, which has the support of the very important public policy considerations mentioned.""
40In Skaf, the improper conduct involved two jurors visiting a park to clarify the state of the lighting after dark, which was relevant to an issue in the trial.  The Court (constituted by Mason P, Wood CJ at CL and Sully J) accepted evidence of the conduct of the jurors but excluded any reference to the possible impact of the extraneous material upon the jurors' deliberative processes: at [233].  These principles were reviewed by the Court of Appeal of Western Australia in a recent decision of Smith v State of Western Australia [2013] WASCA 7 (Martin CJ, McLure P and Mazza JA agreeing), a case involving an incomplete and ambiguous note left in the jury room after the appellant was convicted.  The Court did not allow the note to be tendered on the appeal to establish a miscarriage of justice; it also declined to authorise an inquiry, because that would intrude into the deliberations of the jury: at [48].  (The High Court is presently reserved on an appeal against this judgment.)
41Of importance in the present case is the change made to the law, not merely by the introduction of s 73A, but of that provision in tandem with s 68B (s 68C, relating to inquiries made by a juror is not relevant for present purposes).  It is convenient to set out the terms of both these provisions.  The operative provision in the second case is s 73A, which relevantly provides:
73A Investigation by sheriff of jury irregularities
(1) If there is reason (including a report under section 75C) to suspect that the verdict of a jury in a trial of any criminal proceedings may be, or may have been, affected because of improper conduct by a member or members of the jury, the sheriff may, with the consent of or at the request of the Supreme Court or District Court, investigate the matter and report to the court on the outcome of the investigation.
(2) Section 68A(1) does not prohibit the sheriff from soliciting information from a juror or former juror for the purpose of conducting such an investigation.
(3) Section 68B(1) does not prohibit a juror from disclosing information to the sheriff in connection with such an investigation.
(4) Section 139(2) of the Evidence Act 1995 applies in relation to any questioning conducted by the sheriff for the purpose of an investigation under this section (in the same way as it applies to official questioning by an investigating official).
(5) The sheriff may, despite sections 29 and 68, include a juror's name or other matter that identifies a juror in a report to the court under this section.
42As may be seen, sub-ss (2) and (3) exclude the prohibition in ss 68A(1) and 68B(1) with respect to soliciting information from a juror and a juror disclosing information, in each case by reference to the role of the Sheriff.  It is convenient to set out these provisions in full:
68A Soliciting information from or harassing jurors or former jurors
(1) A person must not solicit information from, or harass, a juror or former juror for the purpose of obtaining information about:
(a) the deliberations of a jury, or(b) how a juror, or the jury, formed any opinion or conclusion in relation to an issue arising in a trial or coronial inquest.
Maximum penalty on indictment: imprisonment for 7 years.
(2) The deliberations of a jury include statements made, opinions expressed, arguments advanced or votes cast by members of the jury in the course of their deliberations.
68B Disclosure of information by jurors etc
(1) A juror must not, except with the consent of or at the request of the judge or coroner, wilfully disclose to any person during the trial or coronial inquest information about:
(a) the deliberations of the jury, or(b) how a juror, or the jury, formed any opinion or conclusion in relation to an issue arising in the trial or coronial inquest.
Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units.
(2) A person (including a juror or former juror) must not, for a fee, gain or reward, disclose or offer to disclose to any person information about:
(a) the deliberations of a jury, or(b) how a juror, or a jury, formed any opinion or conclusion in relation to an issue arising in a trial or coronial inquest.
Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units.
(3) The deliberations of a jury include statements made, opinions expressed, arguments advanced or votes cast by members of the jury in the course of their deliberations.
(4) Subsection (1) does not prohibit a juror from disclosing information to another member of the jury during a trial or coronial inquest.
43The prohibition in s 68B(1) operates only with respect to disclosure ""during the trial"".  An inquiry authorised by s 73A may occur during a trial, but that is not this case.  By contrast, s 68B(2), which covers any person, provides that a ""former juror"" is prohibited from disclosing the identified information ""for a fee, gain or reward"": it would not operate with respect to an inquiry by the Sheriff in any event.
44Section 68A was introduced in 1987, thus predating s 73A.  So far as the present matter is concerned, the effect of s 73A(2) is to lift the prohibition on the Sheriff soliciting information from a former juror with respect to the deliberations of the jury.  That raises two questions of immediate concern.  First, was s 68A intended to codify or replace the general law prohibition, or was it intended to supplement the general law by imposing a severe penalty for contravention?  Secondly, if the Sheriff has an unrestrained power to inquire into the deliberations of a jury, for the purpose of reporting to the court, does it follow that the court may (or should) take account of evidence as to the deliberations of the jury in determining an appeal in respect of which it is said that the jury has misconducted itself?
45The statutory amendments do not in their terms suggest (nor is there any support for such a proposition in the Second Reading Speech to which the Court was taken) that the general law prohibition on revealing jury deliberations was to be cast aside when the court thought it appropriate to investigate improper conduct on the part of a juror or jurors: such a result should not be adopted absent a necessary implication.  In Ellis v Deheer [1922] 2 KB 113, Bankes LJ stated (with the express agreement of Atkin LJ) at 117-118 that:
""...The court will never admit evidence from jurymen of the discussion which they may have had between themselves when considering their verdict or of the reasons for their decision, whether the discussion took place in the jury room after retirement or in the jury box itself.  It has for many years been a well accepted rule that when once a verdict has been given it ought not be open to an individual juryman to challenge it, or attempt to support it if challenged.  I have spoken of this as a rule of law but it has also been generally accepted by the public as a rule of conduct, that what passes in the jury room during the discussion by the jury of what their verdict should be ought to be treated as private and confidential.""
46As further explained by Atkin LJ at 121:
""The reason why that evidence is not admitted is twofold.  On the one hand it is in order to secure the finality of decisions arrived at by the jury, and on the other to protect the jurymen themselves and prevent their being exposed to pressure to explain the reasons which actuated them in arriving at their verdict.  To my mind it is a principle which it is of the highest importance in the interests of justice to maintain, and an infringement of the rule appears to me a very serious interference with the administration of justice"".  
47The issues raised in these statements have been extensively re-examined in the House of Lords in Regina v Mirza [2004] 1 AC 1118, partly influenced by Strasbourg jurisprudence - see, eg, at [57].  Practice in the UK has undoubtedly changed since these statements were made.  Inquiries are now made of individual jurors: see, eg, R v Adams (Andrew) [2007] 1 Cr App R 34 (EWCA Crim Div)
48One might add that the policy of attaining frank and open communications between jurors is diminished, if not destroyed, not only by the court admitting evidence of those discussions (which should not happen, unless to reveal an offence or by way of similar exception), but also by public discussion by the jurors speaking either to journalists or by blogs on the internet.  One juror's self-indulgent publication, without the knowledge or prior consent of each other juror, is a gross violation of this principle.  It is apparently an area where civic duty, self-restraint and good sense can no longer be relied upon.  However, the ill-discipline of jurors does not mean that the courts should abandon their own principle of refusing to admit evidence of what took place in the jury room by way of deliberation.
49There is no necessary implication that the enactment of s 68A was intended to diminish the jealous protection accorded by the general law to jury deliberations: indeed, the clear implication is to the contrary.  The correctness of the Chief Judge's decision to refuse to request an investigation should be approached by reference to the continuing operation of the fundamental principle protecting jury deliberations from investigation by the court.
The applicant's request50The applicant sought to make much of the allegations in the internet material, as if the comments were uniformly worthy of consideration.  That was self-evidently not the case.  As the persons involved noted, there were only three former jurors commenting.  Some of the commentary was abusive and personally derogatory; much was speculative and tendentious.  It is highly unlikely that the substance, let alone the language, would find its way into an affidavit.  If it did, it would be rejected.  The applicant stated in his letter of 10 January 2011 to the Chief Judge's associate that there were some 11 elements of misconduct, divided into five categories.  These were:
""(1) a large number of jurors doodling and not paying attention to the evidence and apparently even though in favour of the adverse verdict admitted to the inattention by a core group of jurors;(2) falling asleep;(3) being distracted by overbearing home pressures;(4) being under the influence of psychotropic medication;(5) the jury was fractured such that internal in-fighting distracted from impartial consideration of the evidence ...:
51To the extent that conduct such as ""doodling"" was treated as a basis for the inference that a juror was not paying attention, it does not deserve further consideration.  Further, the possibility that jurors should somehow be investigated for the degree of attention paid over the course of a trial lasting several weeks which occurred more than six years ago is in the realm of fantasy.  It is not consistent with the conventional approach to jury conduct.
52The second complaint of falling asleep referred to the following passage in the blog:
""I remember one time in the closing addresses by the judge, the [juror] was arched over with eyes closed asleep.  Meanwhile Petroulias and his counsel are looking in my direction with astonishment.  It took me a few seconds to realise that this [juror] was asleep.  I just firmly tapped [the juror's] leg three times to wake [the juror].""
53If this incident occurred, and was noticed by counsel for the applicant, it was a matter to which the judge's attention should have been drawn at the time.  It is not a matter warranting investigation now.
54The reference to a juror being distracted by ""overbearing home pressures"" depended upon a comment in these terms:
""In regards to the sudden change in [the juror's position] and concern expressed by 'Kum Ba Yah' at the flip flop, you must remember [the juror] was too emotionally drained from [the juror's] troublesome home life to go toe to toe with the lynch mob.  (btw thanks for putting me onto Bioshock - classic, a great 1st person shooter & also onto Mass Effect.""
There is nothing to be investigated in this speculative allegation.
55The claim that one juror was ""under the influence of psychotropic medication"" was supported by the following material:
""By the way ... muso at one point told me that hyena had been on some medication.  ...  That's why [hyena] was kinda out of it.
Not that [hyena] had a clue what the case was about to begin with.  A monkey living on a rock would have been a more qualified juror.
... [another blogger]
'Unfortunately seems that only three of us (former jurors) are part of this Blog, I wish Hyena was tuned as well so that [hyena] would get some feedback as to [hyena's] behaviour.  Definitely doing a cocktail of prescription, non-prescription non - 'over the counter' drugs ....  The monkey living on a rock doing a better job as a juror is an insult - to our distant simian cousin, more like a lump of lichen living on a rock!""
This material would not warrant investigation.
56The extensive reference to the manner in which the deliberations were undertaken invites an investigation of the psychological relationships between the jurors, who were no doubt of very different backgrounds from each other, and thrown together for an extended period in order to undertake a public service which may not have been entirely welcome.  To conduct an investigation into such matters would merely invite the destruction of the jury system.
Conclusions57The proposed investigation was without merit.  No error has been demonstrated in the decision made by McClellan CJ at CL.  If, due to the lack of reasons, it were necessary to reconsider his decision, no other decision should be made.
58The summons in the Court of Appeal should be dismissed.  Because, on the better view of the matter, the case should have been brought by way of an interlocutory appeal in the Court of Criminal Appeal, it is not appropriate to order costs.  To the extent that there was an application for leave to for reconsideration in the Court of Criminal Appeal, it should also be dismissed, by the Court being constituted as the Court of Criminal Appeal.

		18 December 2013",2013-12-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2705692,R v Spicer [2013] NSWSC 1907,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Bernard Spicer and co-accused Michelle Proud and Bradley Rawlinson have been jointly indicted for the murder of Katherine Foreman on 27 October 2011. By his notice of motion filed on 30 October 2013, Mr Spicer seeks an order that he be tried separately from his co-accused Ms Proud pursuant to s 21(2)(b) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That provision is in these terms:
	


""21 Orders for amendment of indictment, separate trial and postponement of trial 

(1) …

(2) If of the opinion:

(a) that an accused person may be prejudiced or embarrassed in his or her defence by reason of being charged with more than one offence in the same indictment, or

(b) that for any other reason it is desirable to direct that an accused person be tried separately for any one or more offences charged in an indictment,

the court may order a separate trial of any count or counts of the indictment.""


	
	The application is based on several grounds as follows:
	



	
	That evidence that is to be led by the Crown against Ms Proud, which is not admissible against him, will be highly prejudicial to him in a joint trial.
	
	
	That there is a significant risk that this highly prejudicial material could turn a potential acquittal into a conviction.
	
	
	That the prejudice is so great that it will not be overcome by directions.
	
	
	That it is in the interests of justice for him to be tried separately from Ms Proud as a positive injustice would be caused to him by a joint trial.
	



	
	The Crown opposes the application.
	


Legal principles


	
	These principles are well established and were not in issue.
	
	
	Where co-accused are said to have been acting in a joint criminal enterprise, a joint trial is the norm: see Webb & Hay v The Queen [1994] HCA 30; (1994) 181 CLR 41 at 89. The applicant for a separate trial bears the onus of establishing otherwise. The applicant must demonstrate that there is a real risk that a positive injustice would be caused to him as a consequence of a joint trial: Regina v Patsalis & Spathis [No 1] [1999] NSWSC 649; (1999) 107 A Crim R 432 at [6]-[13].
	
	
	In R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 190, Adams J said this at [38]-[40]:
	


""[38] In R v Baartman (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal 6 October 1994) this Court approved the following summary of the relevant principles enunciated by Hunt J in R v Middis (unreported, NSWSC 27 March 1991), an approval repeated by Fernando [1999] NSW CCA at [210] –

'Briefly, the relevant principles are that:

1. Where the evidence against an applicant for a separate trial is significantly weaker than and different to that admissible against another or the other accused to be jointly tried with him; and

2. Where the evidence against those other accused contains material highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him; and

3. Where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably stronger by reason of the prejudicial material, a separate trial will usually be ordered in relation to the charges against the applicant. The applicant must show that positive injustice would be caused to him in a joint trial.'

[39] Two phrases in this summary need some explanation. In ordinary speech, 'immeasurably' usually connotes something of such an enormous degree that it is beyond measurement. It is obvious that it was here not used in this sense. I think that his Honour meant 'significant, though incommensurable'. The starting point is that the inadmissible, prejudicial material is completely irrelevant. If, when placed on the scales, it would be likely to turn a potential acquittal to a conviction then this would, I think, amount to 'positive injustice'. Of course, the likelihood cannot be measured: if it is real, as distinct from inconsequential, having regard both to its inherent character and the context of the Crown case, then the trial must necessarily embarrass the affected accused. The question then arises whether the risk that the material might be placed by the jury on the scales is such that the trial miscarried. It should also be noted that Hunt J necessarily assumed that clear and emphatic directions would be given to the jury that the inadmissible material must be ignored and the point made by the summary is that, in the posited circumstances, such directions may well be insufficient to avoid a miscarriage and separate trials should be ordered to prevent such an occurrence.

[40] I interpolate that, with unfeigned respect, I am doubtful that the weakness of the applicant’s case as compared with that of the co-accused against whom it is proposed to tender the prejudicial evidence can be a relevant consideration. Assume that the case against the co-accused was much weaker than the applicant, even with the prejudicial evidence. If there was a significant risk that the prejudicial evidence could be used by the jury adversely to the applicant and that evidence was itself significantly prejudicial, I am unable to see why the mere fact that it was adduced in a weaker co-offender’s case is material. Indeed, the opposite would seem to be the case since, if the co-accused’s case was weak, or weaker than the applicant’s, the prejudicial evidence might well assume even more importance than otherwise. As it seems to me, with respect, the crucial issue is the potential effect of the inadmissible evidence on the jury’s consideration of the applicant’s case.""


	
	These observations were approved in Madubuko v R [2011] NSWCCA 135 at [32]. In R v Iskander [2011] NSWSC 1192, Davies J also observed at [32], [35]-[36] as follows:
	


""[30] If the first principle in Middis has been modified in Pham so that the issue is not, in the first place, a consideration of the relative weakness and strength of the Applicant and the co-accused's case respectively, the enquiry is a similar one - whether there will be a positive injustice to the Applicant by the evidence being likely to turn a potential acquittal into a conviction: Pham at [39]. But as Adams J goes on to point out, if the likelihood is real as distinct from inconsequential then there will be a positive injustice to the Applicant.

…

[35] Two things can be said about that. First, although the assumption is as the High Court set out, there is the sort of exception to that assumption contained in what Hunt J said in Middis and in the various cases that have followed it. The prejudice may be such that directions are unlikely to overcome the prejudice, and hence, the discretion in appropriate cases to order a separate trial. So, for example, in R v Mahmoud Chami [2002] NSWCCA 136 Ipp AJA (with whom Bell J agreed) accepted at [19] - [20] that despite careful and explicit directions it might be difficult for a jury to remain entirely objective.

[36] Secondly, and particularly in this case where the Crown relies on joint criminal enterprise, it would be extremely difficult for the jury to understand that admissions made by one participant in the joint criminal enterprise had to be entirely put out of their collective minds when considering the evidence against the other participant in the same enterprise in circumstances where they considered that that evidence about the admissions was reliable. They could readily conclude that Andrew always had the requisite intention. Since the case is put forward as a joint criminal enterprise it would be difficult for the jury not to conclude, on the basis of that evidence, that the Applicant also had the requisite intention at the earlier time.""


	
	This decision is referred to in more detail later in these reasons.
	


Background


	
	The Crown alleges that Mr Spicer murdered the deceased Katherine Foreman at her home at Corrimal on 27 October 2011. The deceased died from burns she sustained when her house was set alight in the early hours of the morning whilst she was asleep. Mr Spicer accepts that he was present at the house on the morning of the fire and threw petrol from a bucket into the deceased's bedroom. It was then ignited by Wendy Evans, who has pleaded guilty to the murder. Mr Spicer has maintained in an ERISP that Ms Evans assured him that the deceased would not be home and that the fire was ""just to scare the shit out of her."" He said that the house was in complete darkness and that he did not know that anyone was in the bedroom.
	
	
	The Crown proposes to lead evidence during the trial against Ms Proud, which is not admissible against Mr Spicer. He maintains that such evidence will be highly prejudicial to him. That evidence can be summarised as follows.
	
	
	First, on 31 December 2011 Ms Proud is recorded during a legally intercepted telephone conversation with Peggy Case discussing Mr Spicer:
	


""MP   So, what did Nicky say ---

PC   Oh.

MP   ---about it all?

PC   I was fuckin’ fuming. She doesn’t care.

MP   No, about me and BJ?

PC   No, nothing’, she said, you know, I don’t believe that they’d ever kill anybody.

PC   She said you know your brother’s a heartless idiot and he does stupid things, but I don’t even think he’d ever do it.

MP   He did.

PC   Mmm.

MP    He did, though.

PC   ……

MP   Stupid idiot did it, fuckin’ because ---

PC   ……

MP   --- she wanted it, fuckin’, how stupid is he, Peg, seriously?

PC   He didn’t know there was anyone in the house, did he?

MP   Yeah.

PC   Fuck that. How could you fuckin do’ that to somebody?

MP   It wasn’t supposed to happen like that, but I can’t really talk over the phone, you know what I mean, you’ll have to book a visit ---

PC   Yeah.

MP   --- and I’d have to tell you about, because they ---

PC   Yeah.

MP   --- record messages, so I can’t really ---"" [Emphasis added]


	
	Secondly, later on 31 December 2011 Ms Proud is recorded during another legally intercepted telephone conversation with Peggy Case discussing Mr Spicer:
	


""PC   Did you know about it before or after it happened?

MP   After.

PC   Why did he do it?

MP   I’ll have to explain it to you when I see you.

PC   I just can’t, I feel sick now, I never ever, in my life, thought he would do something like that, intentionally.

MP   But don’t tell anyone, you know what I mean, just, just don’t let anyone know he’s, he did, you know what I mean, like fuckin’, he doesn’t need his whole family against him over it, you, you know.

PC   Yeah I know.

MP   Like, he’s gunna need support when he gets out, he doesn’t need the whole family and ---

PC   He’s not gunna get out.

MP   He’s lookin’ at 25 to life.

PC   He’s not gunna get out.""


	
	Thirdly, on 1 January 2012 Ms Proud is recorded during a legally intercepted telephone conversation with Celia Todorovich again discussing Mr Spicer:
	


""CT   So, how does she feel about all this?

MP   She asked me yesterday, Did he do it, and I said, Yes, and she goes, He knew there was no one in there, and, I said, Yeah, and then she was a bit upset. She just didn’t believe he could do somethin’ like that, she knew he could do petty shit but, like I said to her, it’s a long story, I can’t say it over the phone, I’d have to explain it to her, because ---

CT   Yeah

MP    --- he literally didn’t do it how she thinks he’s done it, you know what I mean, but yeah ---

CT   So, he, he was led to believe there was nobody in the house, that right, or not?

MP   No.

CT   Oh, OK.

MP   It’s, I, it’s hard to, because ---

CT   Yeah.

MP   --- my phone calls get recorded.

CT   Yeah, I know, love, no don’t worry …

MP   But, yeah, I’d have to explain it to you more, when I see you next, how it really, what ---

CT    …

MP   --- really happened, for it to go like that, but yeah, it was only supposed to be a scare, not this total thing that it’s turned out to be.

CT   Yeah.

MP   Yeah. So I’ll have to explain, I can’t explain it over the phone."" [Emphasis added]


	
	Fourthly, Ms Proud is secretly recorded on a listening device installed at 26 Karangi Road, Whalan speaking with Danielle Gallagher in the course of a conversation on 15 December 2011:
	


""MP   Can you keep a really, really big secret if I told you. You can’t tell anyone. Got this letter I am being investigated by the Homicide Team. When I lost my licence my friend had a friend that was a solicitor for her and they ended up having a fight. She started getting people after her and that. She asked BJ if he could go down there and do something about it with her. That night we went down there they went down there they went and got fuel and they weren’t supposed to kill her but they ended up killing her when they lit the house on fire.

DG   Who lit the house on fire?

MP   BJ and Wendy, it was only supposed to be a warning thing for her to back off but they actually ended up killing her cause she didn’t run out of the house or anything and the house exploded. There was some gas or something in there and it just exploded it wasn’t meant to happen. We’re trying to find a story to keep BJ out of it.  Cause as far as I they know I spoke to Wendy, Wendy came up here to pick us up and the story we are going to tell them is BJ booked the Hotel under his name because I wasn’t home to do it and Wendy came to pick me and the three kids up and had to come back to pick my step daughter up to give us a holiday down there … …

DG   Is he upset?

MP   He was sick when he found out on the news she was killed. It was in the news the next day. He wasn’t supposed to kill her; he was supposed to warn her to back off because she is a very nasty girl. The bloke Wendy is with now was her ex husband because she was fuckin' every copper she was fuckin' the, she was getting away sending people. She put her ex husband in hospital with concussion by hitting him with pots across the head and that. And they had enough and she got people out on Wendy and her kids.

DG   How did they know that BJ was involved?

MP   No one knows that BJ is involved Wendy just told them that she spoke to me on the night it happened. That’s why I have been brought into it. Don’t tell BJ I told you. Don’t say anything to anyone he will kill me. But it wasn’t supposed to kill her it was just a warning thing. When they left apparently the house blew up because it was gas and it killed her instantly.

DG   (inaudible)

MP   No. No. Well he is not going to get caught cause if Wendy doesn’t come undone which she hasn’t yet. (knock on door) hang on.

DG   (inaudible)

MP   The story is to keep BJ out of it is that when BJ booked the hotel under our name we went there cause we were there all night, meant to be all night. How am I supposed to go anywhere with four fuckin' kids you know that late at night. It happened at 2.30 in the morning.

DG   I do not know … (inaudible)

MP   No we are not saying BJ was there at all. BJ is finding an alibi now saying he stayed here it was just me and the kids that went down and Wendy came to pick us up and then she had to come and pick my step daughter up cause they have got it all on thing that she had done two trips up here. Took us down.

DG   Is that the one who died who did the trips.

MP   It’s the one who organised this woman to be done.

DP   Are you not talking to this woman now?

MP   No. No. I knew she was talking to the Police about it but she was using me as an alibi.

DP   I think I remember hearing about this on the news.

MP    Well it was a big thing. She was a high up solicitor.

DP    So what was the headline on the news?

MP   Fuck there was heaps. Solicitor killed … They have already told Wendy they have got no evidence who has done it. There was no evidence left behind no nothing. They can’t prove anyone. The only reason they are hounding Wendy and that was that Wendy used to be best friends with her.

DP   (Inaudible)

MP   But it wasn’t supposed to kill her they were only supposed to warn her to back off.

DP    So was she in the house.

MP   She was in the house asleep.

DP   (Inaudible)

MP   She woke up. See all BJ was supposed to do, like I say BJ all you do is you go in there mess her up a bit. I said damage her face because she thought she thought she was crash hot so that cause she could fuck anyone she wanted and that, I said damage her face and what not bash her a bit and that put her in hospital to the point her face cant be fixed and that because coppers never believed Wendy that Katie was doing all this shit. Katie was a nasty woman when I met her too. The stuff with Wendy’s ex Scott who is in jail now. What she was planning on doing to Scott for what Scott did to Wendy. She was going to have Scott done in jail. She was going to have Scott killed in jail this Katie girl bit nobody believed Wendy’s story cause Katie was well with the Judges she was fucking every copper in Wollongong and all this and that so Wendy asked if the knew anyone who could to the job. She would pay them and …

DP   Is that why you were getting the money?

MP   Yeah. And BJ said we need the cash cause we wanted it to get another car. She … BJ said I will do it for you Wendy. It wasn’t supposed to [kill?] her it was just supposed to scare her.

DP   (Inaudible)

MP    They have got nothing no evidence. … BJ will get 25 to life if he gets caught. She is ringing me back tonight so we can go over the story."" [Emphasis added]


	
	Fifthly, there is material contained in Ms Proud's ERISP dated 21 December 2011. Ms Proud was not present at the premises when the fire was lit. Even though the material in question is unlikely to become evidence against any accused in a joint trial, Mr Spicer relies upon it at this stage as material that, if admitted against Ms Proud, would not be admissible against him, and would necessarily have to be made the subject of a specific direction to the jury to that effect. The portion of the ERISP in question is as follows:
	


""Q492 OK. And both BJ and Wendy went into the house?

A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY)

Q493 And who poured the petrol?

A BJ.

Q494 And, and Wendy…

A Lit it.

Q494 …lit it. OK Where was, where was Katie?

A In her bed.

Q495 OK. Was she asleep?

A I don't know. Um, I think she woke up 'cause she heard noises or something.

Q496 Where were you when this was happening?

A I was at the motel with the four kids."" [Emphasis added]


	
	It is accepted that all references to BJ are references to Mr Spicer.
	


Submissions


	
	The Crown proposes to tender these recorded conversations in the trial in the case against Ms Proud as admissions made by her. The Crown will seek to rely upon this evidence to prove her knowledge in relation to what occurred. These admissions are not admissible against Mr Spicer. In particular, Ms Proud's assertions as to Mr Spicer's involvement generally, or his knowledge of whether the deceased was in the house at the time in particular, are not admissible against him.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of Mr Spicer that in a joint trial, the telephone intercept and listening device material will be played to the jury and that there is a real risk that the Crown case against him will impermissibly be made immeasurably stronger. That is said to be because even a properly directed jury will be unlikely to disregard Ms Proud's statements that Mr Spicer was aware that the deceased was in the house at the time. Mr Spicer is concerned that such a jury will not realistically be able to disregard what Ms Proud has said about him when speaking to third parties, and that her statements that Mr Spicer knew that the deceased was present, even though not evidence in the case against him, will influence their deliberations in a highly prejudicial way.
	
	
	Mr Spicer is concerned that even though the jury would be directed that it must consider the evidence against each accused separately, and that it could not use this evidence in considering the case against him, there remains nonetheless a very real risk that the jurors will be unable to comply with such a direction. Whether that failure were conscious or unconscious, it would if it existed lead to an unjust result in his case.
	
	
	It goes without saying that Mr Spicer contends in these circumstances that evidence of this type led in a joint trial would create a prejudice that could not be overcome by directions. He is concerned that there would be a significant risk that this highly prejudicial inadmissible material could convert a potential acquittal into a conviction. He maintained that it is in the interests of justice that he be tried separately from Ms Proud as a positive injustice may otherwise be caused to him by a joint trial.
	
	
	The Crown has submitted that there are many joint trials that occur regularly in which this very situation arises. Judicial directions crafted to alleviate the prejudice, by explaining what material is admissible, and what material is inadmissible, are regularly given. The Crown contends that Mr Spicer's arguments assume that the jury will disregard such directions and act contrary to them. That argument is not in accordance with long established judicial authority. The Crown submitted that I should assume that jurors will do what their oath requires them to do, which is to consider the evidence impartially, to follow directions of law that they are given and not to be influenced by material that they are directed is inadmissible against Mr Spicer. I was referred to Gilbert v The Queen [2000] HCA 15; (2000) 201 CLR 414 at [31] and R v Abrahams [2013] NSWSC 729 at [55]. McHugh J's comments in Gilbert are worth repeating:
	


""[31] The criminal trial on indictment proceeds on the assumption that jurors are true to their oath, that, in the quaint words of the ancient oath, they hearken to the evidence and that they obey the trial judge's directions. On that assumption, which I regard as fundamental to the criminal jury trial, the common law countries have staked a great deal. If it was rejected or disregarded, no one – accused, trial judge or member of the public – could have any confidence in any verdict of a criminal jury or in the criminal justice system whenever it involves a jury trial. If it was rejected or disregarded, the pursuit of justice through the jury system would be as much a charade as the show trial of any totalitarian state. Put bluntly, unless we act on the assumption that criminal juries act on the evidence and in accordance with the directions of the trial judge, there is no point in having criminal jury trials. It is of course true that, if a jury persists in returning a verdict that is contrary to law, the trial judge must accept it. But that only means in Lord Mansfield's words that, although '[i]t is the duty of the Judge ... to tell the jury how to do right ... they have it in their power to do wrong'.""


	
	The Crown has also contended that the evidence to which the current application relates must be considered against the background of the admissible case against Mr Spicer. In particular, the Crown contends that there is admissible evidence that suggests that Mr Spicer did know that the deceased was present in the bedroom when the fire started. The allegedly prejudicial effect of the inadmissible material had, on this view, to be assessed against the admissible evidence that the Crown contends supported the proposition that Mr Spicer knew that the deceased was in her bedroom. In a contextual way, the alleged prejudice would be lessened or minimised because the jury could arguably come to a conclusion adverse to Mr Spicer about the extent of his knowledge independently of the inadmissible material.
	
	
	The burden of this material, contained in Mr Spicer's own ERISP dated 21 December 2011, is to the effect that he was aware that Ms Evans wanted to ""hurt"" the deceased, as opposed merely to frighten her. Additionally, Mr Spicer gave an account of there being illicit material, apparently recorded on the deceased's mobile phone located in her bedroom, about which Ms Evans was concerned or sensitive. The Crown contended that throwing petrol into the bedroom, as opposed to calmly searching for the mobile phone and taking it if he knew the deceased was not there, was more consistent with her presence in the bedroom than otherwise. This is referred to below.
	
	
	The Crown accepted that there might be exceptional cases where a separate trial should be granted. This was not such a case.
	


Consideration


	
	I raised with the Crown the question of whether or not much, if not all, of the material to which Mr Spicer objected might either be excluded in response to objection by Mr Spicer if the Crown insisted on leading it, or in advance of that whether the Crown might not lead it in the first place. All parties recognised those possibilities as likely. They appeared very likely to me. As I cannot be certain of the answer to my inquiry, however, I have proceeded to determine this application principally upon the basis that the material in question remains potentially evidence that the Crown might seek to lead in the case against Ms Proud.
	
	
	Mr Spicer's ERISP will in due course presumably be tendered as part of the Crown case against him. Some portions of it are instructive for present purposes. They are as follows:
	


""Q69   What was the conversation you and Wendy had in the car on the drive down to Wollongong about, about Katie?

A   About Katie?

Q70    Ah hmm.

A   She just told me that she’s just been fucking her around. Like, Katie had a hit out on Wendy and the police knew about it but they weren’t doing anything because, like, Katie was sleeping with the police. And just shit like that. Wendy’s an idiot.

Q71   Was there talk of any action that Wendy might have taken against Katie?

A   Oh, she turned around and said that she was going to get her, she wanted to hurt her.

Q72   Did she specify how that was to occur?

A   No.

Q73   Did she, did she ask you to help with that?

A   She did, but I turned around and said I didn’t want anything to do with it.

Q80   BJ, once we presented Michelle with the weight of evidence that we had gathered, she then told us certain things about what happened. About the reason for travelling to Wollongong. About your movements from the motel at Windang on the night of the 26th. Your association with Wendy Evans and discussions that you and Michelle had the following morning, O.K. So before you answer my questions, I want you to think about that, O.K. What can you tell me about what happened the night of the 26th of October?

A   This is fuckin' bullshit man. It wasn’t supposed to happen.

Q81   What happened?

A   Wendy rang me up, she’d had enough of this Katie chick fuckin' doing all this shit to her and that, threatening the kids, everything like, and about Scott. I wouldn’t worry about Scott, Scott’s a dickhead you know what I mean? But, and then she turned around, they told me no one was going to be home to start with ---

Q82   Ah hmm.

A   --- and all they wanted to do was scare her. So I turned around and I said to her, 'What are you going to do?' She goes, 'I don’t know'. She goes, 'Burn her car or something'. I turned around and said, 'All right, whatever'. Well they turned around and they offered me three grand.

Q83   Who’s they?

A   Well, Wendy, Wendy turned around and said Brad would pay me three grand to do it.

Q84   O.K.

A   I turned around and I said, 'All right'. And set her car on fire, you know what I mean, like, well they put $1,000 in me sisters TAB account and Wendy come and picked us up.

Q85   On that day?

A   On that day. Then I turned around and said to her, what did she want me to do? She turned around and she goes, 'Look, I’m going to get, Brad’s going to give me the keys, all you have to do is just run inside or whatever, throw a bucket of petrol down and light it'.

Q86   Ah hmm.

A   And I said to her, I said, 'But what about if Katie’s there?' She goes, 'She won’t be, I swear to you she’s not going to be home'. I turned around and I said, well, I was a bit iffy about it, you know what I mean, like, but they had put the money in. And then she turned around and started saying to me like, 'I swear to you, she’s not going to be home'. She swore, like, no one else is going to be there, all it was just to scare the shit out of her.

Q87   Ah hmm.

A   So when she picked me up, like I said, I went to K-Mart, I got a container, went up the servo, filled the container. And then Wendy turned around and said that she was going to come in with me. I turned around, I ran up the stairs, I threw a bucket of petrol on there.

Q88   Where?

A   In a room.

Q89   Ah hmm.

A   Wendy turned around and threw a jiffy firelighter thing in there and the thing just exploded.

Q90   While you were still in the house?

A   Yeah, while I was standing up the hallway.

Q91   Did you get any injuries from that?

A   No.

Q92   What happened then?

A   I was out of there. I was gone. I wasn’t sticking around. And then the next day I seen on the news that someone was in the house. I rang Wendy up and what, what am I supposed to say to her? She’s just fucked me over for life.

Q93   Where was the room?

A   All, all I did was ran up the stairs, she said run up the stairs and she was right behind me and I went to throw it up the stairs and she turned around she goes, 'No, turn to your thing and throw it'.

Q94 When you say turn to your thing, turn…

A   Like turn to your right.

Q95   Yeah.    

A   And she goes, 'Just throw it in there.' Because there was something about, in this room there was supposed to be videos or something of Wendy doing stuff or getting stuff done to her and that. That’s all I did. And I was out of there.

Q96   Did you see inside the room?

A   No, it was pitch black in the whole house.

Q97   Did you know if anybody was in the room?

A   No.

Q209   What did you think was going to happen when you bought the petrol?

A   Like I, like I said all I, bought the petrol, all I, what do you mean what do I think was going to happen?

Q210   Do you think that there was going to be some damage to property? Did you think you were just going to go and light a bonfire somewhere? What did you think would happen, was going to happen when you bought the petrol?

A   When I bought the petrol all I thought I was doing was just going to throw it over the car and that was it.

Q211   And then why did it change to a room?

A   Oh, because all of a sudden the phone was supposed to be in the room and not in the car.

Q212   The phone?

A   Yeah, there was something about this phone, that’s all she kept carrying on about was a mobile phone that had pictures and, of Wendy being, like having things stuck inside of her and all that. And it was just the phone that she wanted. I told her I’d sooner walk, like go up there and get the phone out of the house.

Q213   How did she know the phone would be in that room?

A   I don’t know.

Q214   Do you know what sort of room it was?

A   No.

Q215   Did you know if it was a lounge room, a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen?

A   Oh, she said it was a bedroom.

Q216   Ah hmm. So Wendy told you it was a bedroom?

A   Yeah, she said there was heaps of stuff in there, like, that Wendy, that was, I don’t know if it was discriminating against, well it would have been discriminating against Wendy because it was photos of her and everything like that."" [Emphasis added]


	
	The Crown contends that this material supports a strong case against Mr Spicer and that a jury would be entitled upon this evidence to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, in the wider context of the whole of the evidence in the case but exclusive of the material to which exception is taken, that he was aware that the deceased was or may have been in her bedroom at the time of the fire. Alternatively, to the extent that it remains instructive, the Crown contends that the case against Mr Spicer on the issue of what he knew concerning the whereabouts of the deceased is not weak.
	
	
	There is also other material to which the Crown has pointed in this context. Evidence led at the committal proceedings included forensic material concerned with the cause and probable seat of the fire in the deceased's bedroom. Two experts gave evidence about this.
	
	
	First, Superintendent Robert Alexander from the Fire Investigation and Research Unit with the New South Wales police service. He was cross-examined by Mr Steel about pour patterns inside the bedroom as appears below:
	


""Q. When you’re expressing the term pour do you mean someone inside the room pouring it?

A. Yes.

Q. But that’s a very large area, like several metres isn’t it, where there’s been petrol poured over?

A. What I get from the burn patterns, the damage to the edge of the carpet is that there has been a pour from that western wall around the side of the bed towards the doorway. Normally when people use a liquid accelerant they light the fire from the doorway.

…

Q. Wouldn’t you expect that if petrol had been poured alongside the northern side of the bed there would have been a deep charring along the exposed area where the carpet would have been, not underneath the bed?

A. Well, as I said, it’s a liquid and it flows to its lowest point and those points that I highlighted in that image which 87 shows pretty well were the lowest points. Now, the thing that you take into account is it’s not just being poured on this wooden floor, it’s being poured on carpet. So it’s got to penetrate it, it’s got to run to the lower point. So there’ll be a certain amount of residue staying in the carpet and that residue is going to combust before the item, before the petrol underneath it or the liquid accelerant.

Q. Given that, you couldn’t rule out conclusively that the burn pattern you saw was inconsistent with it being thrown into the room from a bucket rather than someone walking in the room, could you?

A. What I find hard to understand with a bucket being thrown into the room is how we’ve got two areas of heavier damage and areas in between and not. So if you imagine a bucket being thrown how do they concentrate two areas in those two spots?

Q. Well, one explanation would be it hitting the western wall and flowing down there, and that’s one explanation, and some on the bed, and the bed protecting the floor area except for runoff underneath, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. And the other one would be an additional throw to the other area where the low point in the room in the north-eastern corner, correct?

A. So there was more than one throw?

Q. Well, if there was is that consistent?

A. Yeah, that could be consistent, yes. Sorry, I thought you said there was one throw, my apologies.

Q. No, I did initially indicate that to you, but if it was two throws it would be consistent, is that right?

A. Yes, it’s possible.""


	
	Secondly, Detective Senior Constable Suzanne Payne from the Forensic Services Group at Wollongong Police Station. Some of her evidence was as follows:
	


""Q. Your conclusion there at paragraph 15 what do you say generally about those areas of greater fire damage?

A. My conclusion is that this fire was an incendiary or deliberately lit fire using petrol to accelerate the fire. The physical evidence is consistent with petrol having been poured in the northeast corner of the bedroom and on the bed. The petrol has flowed down behind the bed head that was against the western wall and also coated the bedside table on the northern side of the bed. The deceased was either in bed at the time it was dowsed or has come in contact with the petrol and flame at some point and in doing so her clothing has ignited. She has left the bedroom collapsing where she was located in the alcove. There was no other injury or trauma located on the deceased. There was no signs of disturbance in the house nor signs of a forced entry. A number of doors were unlocked at the time of my examination.

…

Q. What he indicated to the police in his interview is that he was responsible for throwing a bucket of petrol into the room while standing at the doorway, just the contents of the bucket and the area of damage that occurred to the western wall, the bed head area and where marker 3 and marker 5 was that would all be consistent with petrol having been thrown from the doorway location perhaps hitting the bed head, someone on the bed and the wall and seeping down behind, would you accept that?

A. Yes.

Q. And certainly in what occurred in the north-eastern corner that would be consistent with an additional throw of petrol into that area is that correct?

A. Yes.""


	
	There will be a significant contest at the trial of what this and similar associated evidence about burn patterns and the like reveal about the position from which Mr Spicer threw or poured the petrol that accelerated the blaze, and the extent to which if at all he was in a position to see the deceased in her bed when he did so. It is sufficient for present purposes to observe that there is competing evidence about these issues. The inferences favourable to Mr Spicer are not necessarily the only inferences available.
	
	
	The evidence that is likely to illuminate Mr Spicer's knowledge about the presence of the deceased in the house or the bedroom is predominantly, if not completely, circumstantial. His own ERISP contains no admission and on the contrary contains a denial. Other material in that ERISP might reasonably be thought to support a view at odds with that denial, but only inferentially. Anyone else's opinion about it, which is the bulk of the material that Mr Spicer is concerned has the potential to deny him the opportunity of an acquittal, is not admissible against him at his trial and is likely to be excluded in any event. Both the direction to the jury about its inadmissibility in the case against Mr Spicer and the jury's ability to comprehend and comply with that direction are of great potential significance. The question is whether the balance between the prospect that the evidence will adversely and prejudicially affect Mr Spicer's chance of an acquittal on the one hand, and the utility and effectiveness of any necessary direction to counter that prospect on the other hand, sufficiently weighs in favours of a separate trial.
	
	
	The evidence of the intercepted conversations and the ERISPs is not strong. It is no more than a quite limited collection of conversational hearsay suggestions by some of the various participants that Mr Spicer knew that the deceased would be present in her bedroom. The statements do not explain, beyond mere assertion, how it is that the speakers ""knew"" what Mr Spicer's state of knowledge was at the time or how that asserted and proclaimed so called ""knowledge"" on their part came to be acquired.
	
	
	It will be recalled that in Iskander Davies J was persuaded to order separate trials of the applicant father and his son Andrew Iskander, who were jointly accused of murdering the wife's/mother's lover. The allegedly prejudicial material about which the applicant was concerned included evidence from a school friend of Andrew Iskander about what Andrew had told his friend shortly after the killing. Those statements included details of how Andrew's father allegedly stabbed the deceased, including:
	


""And then pretty much what they did was that they attacked him, eh (sic) smashed a hammer on his forehead and the he (sic) was nearly dead and his dad finished him off with a couple more stabs, into the back and stuff like that.

…

He just said he got a hammer or something and then he smacked him in the forehead and that's pretty much all he said and that he was nearly about to die and his dad finished him off with the knife so pretty much that's what he told me.

…

He indicated me like his dad finished him off and stabbed him so I'm presuming that pretty much had the knife.""


	
	Andrew Iskander also spoke to a fellow prisoner while on remand awaiting trial. That prisoner gave a statement of what Andrew Iskander told him, which included the following:
	


""[4] ... I asked him what happened. He told me that he and his father were going to knock this guy. I asked him why, and he told me that his mum was having an affair with this guy. I asked him whereabouts, and he said, 'Outside of where the bloke lived'. He told me he did this in February this year.

[5] He told me the first plan was to kidnap him, tie him up and take him in the boot to Woolloomooloo. Once they were there, they were going to kill him there. He told me the first thing that happened was his Dad hit him with the car. The man fell, and Andrew got out and chased him around the car. As Andrew got to him, Andrew hit him with the hammer.

[6] Then the father jumped out of the car and stabbed the man with a knife. He told me that his father stabbed the man twice. They took off in the car they were in. Andrew told me that his father told him to get rid of all the evidence.""


	
	This evidence went directly to the issue of the father's physical involvement in the killing of the deceased. It was evidence that included particular details of how the father stabbed the deceased in circumstances where provocation was raised and where it was potentially inimical to that defence. It was not admissible in the father's trial and yet it would have been difficult for the jury to put out of their mind a statement by the co-accused son that directly placed his father at the scene and involved in acts of violence against the victim that were arguably premeditated rather than responsive or reactive.
	
	
	In the present case, there is undisputed evidence that Mr Spicer was physically involved in the events that caused the death of the deceased. Mr Spicer has made admissions to that effect. That includes evidence that he threw petrol into the bedroom. There is also evidence that he was interested in the presence of the deceased's phone located in that room. The Crown case will be that the pour and burn patterns suggest that he could not have thrown the petrol from the doorway but that he must have entered the room. The Crown contends that this material is all consistent with a positive case from which a respectable inference could be drawn that Mr Spicer must have known the deceased was present in the bedroom, so that the possible or potential prejudice arising from the material that is objected to is small by comparison, or alternatively non-existent if it is either not led or is rejected. That prejudicial material, by way of contrast, consists of limited and inadmissible hearsay assertions by a co-accused who was not present at the scene concerning what she believed to be Mr Spicer's state of mind or state of knowledge at the time.
	
	
	In Regina v Patsalis & Spathis [No 1] at [6] Kirby J said:
	


""[6] There is a rule, and a proviso to that rule. It is desirable, in the ordinary course, that all persons said to have been concerned with the one crime should be dealt with in the one trial. That rule is subject to the proviso that, if a joint trial would cause positive injustice to an accused, then a separate trial should be ordered (R v Oliver (1984) 57 ALR 543).""


	
	In R v Symss [2003] NSWCCA 77 at [68] Sheller JA said:
	


""[68] The decision whether or not to grant separate trials involves a consideration of the interests of justice, including conserving costs, the avoidance of inconvenience to witnesses and the desirability of common enterprises being jointly tried so as to avoid inconsistent verdicts.""


	
	The extent to which Mr Spicer will suffer prejudice depends upon what the evidence properly admissible against him is capable of establishing.
	
	
	The cases against Mr Spicer and Ms Proud are different and distinct. The case against Ms Proud will presumably be based upon her knowledge and agreement to commit the joint criminal enterprise before it occurred. The issues in her trial are therefore likely to be whether she was ever aware that petrol would be thrown into the deceased's bedroom, and that with such an awareness she either participated, or continued to participate, in the enterprise.
	
	
	The case against Mr Spicer involves the narrower issue of whether he knew the deceased was at home at the time that he threw the petrol into her bedroom. It is not controversial that he was involved in at least a joint criminal enterprise to do that. His case, however, is that the scope of the enterprise was limited to arson, and that he relied upon the assurances given to him by Ms Evans that the deceased was not at home. His case will be in those circumstances that he had an intention neither to kill nor cause really serious injury when he did what he did. Alternatively, Mr Spicer will contend that he did not foresee that such an act would probably cause the death of the deceased.
	
	
	The Crown case against Mr Spicer is wholly circumstantial in relation to his knowledge and awareness of whether or not the deceased was home at the time. He takes issue with the proposition that the case against him is strong. Before he could be convicted of murder or manslaughter the Crown would need to prove beyond reasonable doubt that he knew or was aware at the time of the act causing her death that the deceased was present in the home. In order to prove that beyond reasonable doubt, the Crown will have to establish that there is no other reasonable conclusion from the circumstances other than he had the requisite knowledge or awareness. The Crown will have to eliminate as a reasonable possibility that Mr Spicer was told by Ms Evans that the deceased was definitely not home and that he believed and relied upon these assertions by her.
	
	
	There is no direct evidence in the Crown case that Mr Spicer was aware that the deceased was at home at the time. The nature and extent of the prejudice said to arise from the inadmissible statements made by Ms Proud about his knowledge have therefore to be assessed in that context. Mr Spicer submitted that the prejudice is ""enormous"" and that the Proud material does make the case against him immeasurably stronger. Mr Spicer submitted that it would be asking too much of the jury to put to one side as inadmissible any material that conveys an impression that Mr Spicer knew that the deceased was in the house. In particular, it is said that it is a relevant consideration that the source of the material is not merely from a co-accused in a joint criminal enterprise but from Mr Spicer's de facto partner. The fear is that the jury in such a case would be likely to find the statements to be highly credible.
	
	
	Mr Spicer contended that it would be, ""virtually impossible, as a matter of common sense, for a jury to disregard this prejudicial material in their consideration of the case against"" him.
	
	
	The Crown contends that there is a strong circumstantial case, which is capable of establishing that Mr Spicer either knew that the deceased was present in the home at the time or was at the very least recklessly indifferent to whether she was there or not.
	
	
	The offence took place at around 2.30am. Mr Spicer knew it was the deceased's home. Her car was parked in the driveway. Mr Spicer had spoken with the co-accused Ms Evans prior to the offence about how she wanted the deceased hurt. Telephone records allegedly show that Ms Proud and/or Mr Spicer and Ms Evans made contact on 38 separate occasions in the twelve-hour period between 2.18pm on the afternoon before the fire and 2.59am the following morning. Mr Spicer had driven from Sydney to Wollongong with Ms Evans the day before the fire. The deceased's bedroom was very small, and it is entirely conceivable that the jury might be satisfied that even if Mr Spicer had not entered it he would nonetheless have been aware that the someone was asleep in the bed. The fire expert evidence indicates seats of fire consistent with petrol having been poured at two locations within the bedroom. Mr Spicer initially denied in his ERISP even going to the house until confronted with listening device product. The Crown contends that his denials are lies evidencing a consciousness of guilt. Mr Spicer was also paid for his role. There is evidence that he belligerently demanded the balance of this money after the event in a way that the Crown submits is consistent with an awareness of the successful completion of the job. The Crown also contends that an inference is available that Mr Spicer was with Ms Evans when she received a text message from the co-accused Mr Rawlinson, who had been with the deceased earlier in the evening, telling Ms Evans that the deceased was by then asleep in her bed.
	
	
	In all of these circumstances the Crown submits that the prejudice associated with the admission of the Proud material, if it is admitted, is ""fairly minimal"" considering what the admissible evidence against Mr Spicer alone is potentially capable of establishing. Can it therefore be said that the case against Mr Spicer becomes immeasurably stronger if the Proud material were heard by the jury?
	
	
	The case against Mr Spicer for murder is fairly strong. It establishes in its own right at least an intention to inflict serious bodily harm upon the deceased or a reckless indifference to her life. Each of these possibilities is capable of being established by the fact that Mr Spicer took an extremely flammable substance to the deceased's home to set her bedroom alight without doing anything beforehand to establish, consistently with his denials that he did not intend to harm her, that she was in fact not there at the time. There is an available conclusion that Mr Spicer did know that she was there.
	
	
	In my opinion the potential prejudice is small. This is for at least five reasons. First, the prejudicial material complained of is in a narrow compass. It consists of statements made by only one person, not in Mr Spicer's presence, and he otherwise and elsewhere denies its truth. The inadmissible evidence is therefore quite confined, correspondingly discrete and easily distinguishable from the balance of other admissible evidence against him. Secondly, because the statements are so limited and narrow, they are capable of being efficiently and conveniently quarantined for the purposes of formulating appropriately concise and straightforward jury directions, possibly in writing, about disregarding them entirely for any purpose in the case against Mr Spicer. Thirdly, there is a wealth of admissible evidence, albeit circumstantial, with the benefit of which the jury could confidently formulate its conclusions, whatever they might be, unburdened by the lurking but inadmissible influence of the objectionable material. The Crown's submission on the strength of its case against Mr Spicer was formulated on this application as one that would effectively swamp the potential prejudice arising from the inadmissible material that may become evidence in the case against Ms Proud. Fourthly, there seems to me to be a highly likely and ever present prospect that none of the material to which Mr Spicer takes objection will ultimately either be led by the Crown at all or admitted over objection from Mr Spicer if it is. Finally, I am required to give effect to the wisdom that the jury can be expected to consider the evidence in the light of and according to the directions that they are given and the oaths by which they are bound: for example, Gilbert at [31].
	
	
	I do not consider that this is a case in which the prejudicial material, if it is admitted, could turn a potential acquittal into a conviction. I do not consider that the prejudice is so great that it cannot be overcome by appropriate directions. It is not therefore in the interests of justice that Mr Spicer be tried separately from Ms Proud. I do not consider that a positive injustice will otherwise be occasioned to Mr Spicer.
	
	
	I am not prepared in the circumstances to order a separate trial.

		24 July 2015",2013-12-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705695,R v Mehajer [2013] NSWDC 266,"SENTENCE

1HIS HONOUR: In late 2008, Mohamad Mehajer, a property developer, was anxious to refinance a large loan he had with Suncorp Bank. He needed to borrow more than $3 million from another source to pay out the Suncorp loan, but there were a number of matters which suggested, at least on paper, that any financial institution considering lending him that sum of money would have some concerns. One of the financial institutions approached was the National Australia Bank Limited. 

2Acting on Mr Mehajer's behalf was a man known as Mohamed Diab. Mr Diab, aware of the concerns that the National Australia Bank Limited was likely to have, created a false document in order to pretend to the National Australia Bank Limited that Mohamad Mehajer was involved with the development of properties where there was no development planned. With the offender's agreement, that document was used as part of a loan application to the National Australia Bank.

3Another false document was created, probably by someone else. Mohamad Mehajer gave this further document to Mohamed Diab so that it could also be used as part of the application. This document showed Mr Mehajer's financial position to be much rosier than it really was. Those two documents were used as part of an agreement between the offender and Mohamed Diab to cheat and defraud the National Bank of more than $3 million. A jury found the offender guilty of that offence on 26 July 2013.

4The offender also faced trial at the same time on a charge of corruptly giving a benefit to Mohamad Sowaid. Mr Sowaid was employed by the National Australia Bank and was one of the bank officers who was to process the loan application. Mr Mehajer gave Mr Sowaid $2,000 in cash. At his trial, Mr Mehajer claimed that this was simply so that Mr Sowaid would work overtime and indeed he claimed that as he handed the money to Mr Sowaid, in private he said ""this is not a bribe,"" but the evidence surrounding the circumstances of the payment clearly demonstrated that it was. The jury found Mr Mehajer guilty of an offence under s 249B(2) of the Crimes Act.

5There is one aspect of that verdict which requires examination by me as part of the sentencing process. I directed the jury that it was possible that even on Mr Mehajer's version of events he was guilty of the offence. Thus it falls to me to determine the facts on which I will sentence Mr Mehajer. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the version he gave in his evidence should be rejected and the version advanced by the Crown, based as it was on the evidence of Mohamad Sowaid, should be accepted. There are a number of reasons for this.

6Firstly, as I have hinted, if the payment was simply intended to be a gift to reward Mr Sowaid for working overtime, then there would be no need for that payment to be made in private.

7Secondly, the strongest evidence as to the purpose of the payment is to be found in what happened when the loan was not approved. Although the offender himself did not ask for the $2,000 to be returned, Mr Sowaid was asked by someone else to return the money, and an intercepted telephone call reveals Mr Mehajer making no protest when Mr Sowaid told him that he was going to return the money.

8Thirdly, the context of other telephone calls involving Mr Diab and others clearly suggests that Mr Diab at least understood the money to be intended as a bribe. 

9Fourthly, Mr Mehajer could give no explanation as to how he had determined the amount of $2,000 was appropriate if it was only intended to cover Mr Sowaid's overtime work. There was no enquiry as to how many hours it would take Mr Sowaid to process the loan, nor what Mr Sowaid was paid for overtime work. 

10In truth, what Mohamad Mehajer did was attempt to bribe Mr Sowaid to overlook any problems in his loan application because he was in urgent need of loan approval.

11It is important in assessing the objective gravity of each of these two offences to bear this important circumstance in mind: Although it was Mr Mehajer's intention to get more than $3 million out of the National Australia Bank, it was also his intention that the money would be repaid. This was not a case where Mr Mehajer intended to take the money and run. It is a case where he intended to get a loan which he thought he might not otherwise get. It was Mr Mehajer's intention to present himself to the bank as a better risk than he truly was. It is also important to bear in mind that no loan was ever granted and so the National Australia Bank never suffered any loss, nor, had the loan been granted, was it likely to have suffered any loss given Mr Mehajer's financial position at the time. 

12On the other hand, that is not to suggest that these offences are not serious. They clearly are. They were both offences of significant dishonesty, significant even in the murky world of finder's fees, commissions, and seemingly random charges which became apparent as the evidence in Mr Mehajer's trial progressed. Although others may have suggested some of the dishonest means - I refer to the false documents - as a means of obtaining the loan, the offender readily embraced them and acted further in a dishonest way by attempting to bribe Mr Sowaid. The fact that the money was to be repaid, (it was always Mr Mehajer's intention so to do), means that this conspiracy charge is less culpable than most offences of this type but, I repeat, it is still a serious offence. The bribery charge was serious as well, especially given the findings of fact I have made. I referred when sentencing Mr Sowaid to some of the matters which make bribery offences such as these as serious as they truly are. 

13It is somewhat remarkable that the offender has committed his first offences after a lifetime of good work. Until he committed these offences, he was a man of good character. He appears to have been a successful property developer who reaped the rewards of his hard work and astute investments. He is a father and grandfather, and he is rightfully proud of what he has achieved. He has worked hard to develop parts of Auburn. He is a successful businessman. He has encouraged his children to engage in their own education and he has been dramatically successful in that regard. His children are all either at university, have graduated from university or, in the case of the youngest, at high school. He has led his family in a manner of which all of us would be proud. 

14There is more too. The offender has demonstrated much unselfish behaviour. He is involved in a not for profit organisation called the Australian Community Association. He is a leader in the Auburn community and done much good work there. 

15References attesting to his good character were tendered to the Court today, although I do have to say that those referees who continue to assert the offender's innocence clearly provided references of lesser value because of that circumstance, but that is a very minor matter in the assessment of the offender's character. And so at 57 years of age he comes to be sentenced for serious crimes for the first time. He has a remarkable and extensive bank of good character on which he is entitled to rely.

16There is one particular matter that I need to refer to in assessing the criminality of the conspiracy charge which I should have mentioned earlier. That assessment requires more than just looking at the particular acts of a particular offender, it's the combination of minds with an illegal purpose which is part of the criminality involved in a conspiracy charge. 

17The offender is not to have a justifiable sense of grievance when he compares the sentence that I impose upon him with those I imposed on two co-offenders, Mr Sowaid and Mr Diab. Mr Sowaid, who agreed to assist the authorities and did so, was ordered to perform 400 hours community service. Mr Diab received a discount for assistance and pleading guilty, and received a sentence of three years consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months and a period of eligibility for parole of 18 months. Before discount, those sentences would have been 27 months non-parole period with a head sentence of four years and six months. 

18I have little hesitation in finding that Mr Diab was keener than the offender to use the dishonest means to promote Mr Mehajer's loan application. On the other hand, as I said before, the offender embraced those dishonest means enthusiastically and his decision to bribe Mr Sowaid appears to have been his alone.

19The Crown concedes that there is no need for any level of accumulation in the two sentences to be imposed. Not surprisingly, Mr Barker QC submitted similarly, but I do not agree. Although there is some overlap of course, the two offences represent separate and discrete elements of criminality. The conspiracy charge focused on the use of two documents without benefit to anyone at the bank. The bribery charge is of a different nature, it is a different form of corruption, and so I will partially accumulate the sentences to reflect that circumstance. 

20It is to be remembered that the offender did not plead guilty. He of course is not to be punished for that, but he does not receive any discount for any utilitarian assistance that a plea of guilty would carry. 

21It is also of course relevant to assess his prospects of rehabilitation that he does not admit, apparently to this day, that he did anything wrong. Sometimes that can be an impediment to a finding that an offender has good prospects for rehabilitation, but I will not make that finding in this case, if only because of the substantial personal deterrence that the sentences I am about to impose will carry with them.

22Mr Barker relied on extra-curial punishment. The offender's business will suffer and he may well lose licences he requires in order to carry on his business. I will take those matters into account, but I will not take into account any hardship to third parties that may eventuate. The law is clear. I am only able to do that in the event that hardship is exceptional. It is not exceptional that breadwinners are sent to gaol. It is not exceptional that families lose the support of a loved one. It is not exceptional that successful businessmen are less able to provide for their families because they are sent to prison. 

23Of course, the offender will know that it is his misconduct which has led to this very situation. His time in prison will be affected by that circumstance, but there are probably more important features regarding the offender's time in prison than that. 

24Prisons are terrible places. They are not places for a 57 year old with no prior criminal convictions. He will stand out. Other prisoners do not like people who stand out. He will have a time in gaol which is likely to be isolated and hard for him to understand. In making that last comment I do not refer only to his language difficulties, he being assisted by an interpreter throughout the sentencing proceedings and for most of the trial. 

25Mr Barker also relies on delay. There has been a significant delay between when these offences were committed and when the offender is being sentenced for them. There has even been a delay between conviction in June this year and sentence. 

26There are two reasons for that, none of which is attributable to the offender. The first is that when the matter was first listed for sentence, the Court neglected to order an interpreter for the offender. The second is that my arrangements were such that I could not return to this matter until today. I will take into account the delay between offence and today's sentencing proceedings in the offender's favour. The report of Dr Westmore tendered today referred to the difficulties that the offender has had waiting for this day to come. They are very real and understandable given what must necessarily happen today. 

27This is a case where although imprisonment is of course a sentence of last resort, it is necessary that such a sentence be imposed. Indeed, the submissions of Mr Barker conceded that a sentence of imprisonment was required and concentrated on attempting to persuade me to impose a sentence of such length the alternatives to full time imprisonment were available. The length of the sentences that I have chosen is such that no alternatives to imprisonment arise. I make a finding of special circumstances in the offender's favour, his age and the fact that he is going into custody for the first time, justify reducing the non-parole period at the expense of the period of eligibility for parole.

28I impose sentences as follows.

29On count 2 I impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months to date from today 18 December 2013. On count 1 I impose a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 18 months with a head sentence of three years to date from 18 June 2014. Thus the overall sentence is one consisting of a non-parole period of two years, a period of eligibility for parole of one and a half years, and a head sentence of three and a half years. The offender is eligible to be released to parole on 17 December 2015.

		05 February 2014",2013-12-17 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705701,Majury (nee Calvert) v R [2013] NSWDC 325,"Judgment


	
	This is a case about a motorbike accident. Two bikes collided. Both of the riders were seriously injured. The police charged one of the riders with an offence called negligent driving occasioning serious bodily harm. That is an offence against s 42(1) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 (NSW).
	
	
	The case went to court and was heard by his Honour Magistrate Bone over 7 and 8 March 2013 at Cooma. On 27 March 2013 his Honour delivered his judgment and was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the rider who had been charged. His Honour convicted her of the offence.
	
	
	She has appealed against that conviction and the case has come before me sitting here on circuit in Queanbeyan. When a person appeals from a conviction in the Local Court, the District Court judge reads the magistrate's judgment and the evidence which the magistrate took into account in reaching a conclusion. The judge hears arguments from the prosecution and the defence but usually no additional evidence. There has been no additional evidence in this case.
	
	
	The person convicted and who is the appellant is Stella Majury. The accident happened on 14 January 2012. It happened on the Monaro Highway just beyond the turnoff to the Snowy River Way. Stella Majury was riding with a group of friends. She was riding along the Monaro Highway towards that Snowy River Way intersection. She realised a little late that her companions were turning left at that intersection and she stayed on the Monaro Highway and slowed down and pulled over to her left, intending to make a u-turn and ride back towards the intersection so that she could join her companions.
	
	
	She looked in her rear view mirror and over her shoulder and made a right turn across the centre line. What happened then is what this case is about. James Thiedman was on his motorbike riding in the same direction as Stella Majury. He was not with her group. He was following other members of her group but his intention was not to turn left but to go straight ahead. He pulled out around the other members of Stella Majury's group but then, despite harsh braking, collided with Stella Majury and her bike. As I said, both were very seriously injured. It was described as a t-bone collision.
	
	
	His Honour was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Majury was negligent in conducting her turn. His Honour said in a clear and helpful written judgment that the ""negligence rests in the fact that she did not wait until all of the cyclists who she thought were going to turn left had in fact turned left so that she had a clear view of the road to the south."" (That was at [28] of his Honour's reasons.) His Honour said that Ms Majury ""did not wait until she had a clear view of any approaching traffic and it is imprudent and careless to commence a turn without a clear view"".
	
	
	Ms Majury is represented in this appeal by Mr Anthony Black SC who also appeared for her before the learned magistrate. The respondent to the appeal, the Director of Public Prosecutions, is represented by Ms K Stanley.
	
	
	Mr Black SC's point is that his Honour was in error in that there were two reasonable possibilities consistent with his client's innocence which had not been excluded by the evidence. His Honour had overlooked them and was in error in being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his client's guilt. One of those reasonable possibilities concerns what Ms Majury could see when she looked behind her before making the turn. The evidence, I accept, is that there was a distance of some 155 metres before the view was obscured by a combination of a bend and crest in the road. His Honour had concluded that Mr Thiedman's bike was within that distance, no more than 120 metres back from Ms Majury. It is that conclusion which Mr Black SC challenges in one of his arguments.
	
	
	That argument is that the prosecution ""did not exclude the possibility (probability) that the Triumph only came into view after the u-turn had commenced"". Mr Thiedman was riding the Triumph. Mr Black SC's point is that his Honour's conclusion about Mr Thiedman being no more than 120 metres behind his client at the vital time was based upon calculations made by an expert called on behalf of his client, a Mr Hall. Mr Black SC argues that his Honour overlooked an assumption which Mr Hall had made, namely that Mr Thiedman's Triumph was travelling at a constant speed which was about the same as that being maintained by the group that his client was part of. That assumption is not warranted on the evidence, says Mr Black.
	
	
	The evidence is that Ms Majury's group left Bombala and Mr Thiedman was behind that group. Mr Black points to evidence from two members of Ms Majury's group, namely Mr Holt and Ms Walker, who say that as they were riding between Bombala and the collision site and regularly checking their rear view mirrors they did not see Mr Thiedman's bike. In addition, Mr Walker gave evidence that at around the intersection Mr Thiedman was rapidly decelerating. He said that he ""heard this bike come really fast off the accelerator, which would slow them down"". It follows, Mr Black SC argues, that there is a real possibility, if not a probability, that Mr Thiedman on his Triumph was travelling at a greater speed than that being maintained by Ms Majury's group. If that is so then the estimate of 120 metres given by Mr Hall needs to be adjusted. If Mr Thiedman was travelling a greater speed then there is a real possibility, if not a probability Mr Black says, that Mr Thiedman was back beyond the crest and the intersection when his client commenced her turn. In other words, as he says, there was ""the possibility (probability) that the Triumph only came into view after he u-turn had commenced"".
	
	
	Ms Stanley submits that this argument developed by Mr Black SC is no more than speculation. There is a certain speculative aspect about it. There are many assumptions which experts have to make, and reconstruction of accidents and estimates of speeds and distances are just that, they are estimates and reconstructions. However, in this case the learned magistrate accepted the evidence of the expert, Mr Hall, and his estimates about the distances involved. What his Honour seems to have overlooked, it seems to me with respect, and as Mr Black SC argues, is that the assumption was based upon Mr Thiedman travelling at a constant speed. I think the evidence from the sources that Mr Black has directed me to shows that that is an unreliable assumption. It leaves open to my mind the real possibility that Mr Thiedman was beyond the line of sight of Ms Majury when she started her turn.
	
	
	I myself am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she drove negligently in making that turn. I would allow her appeal, find her not guilty and acquit her of the offence.
	
	
	The formal order which I make is this, under s 20 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) I determine this appeal against conviction by setting aside the conviction.
	


HIS HONOUR: Anything else I need to do?

BLACK: No, may it please the Court.

HIS HONOUR: No? All right.

STANLEY: I think the formal order is usually appeal upheld but--

HIS HONOUR: You are right, that is what is usually said but I usually include that in my remarks, but when I say that I will allow the appeal. But the formal order is what the statute provides for, that is how I do it. It does not accord with the computer but it does accord with the statute.

2705707,R v Gierczynski [2013] NSWSC 1870,"Judgment

Introduction

1On 26 June 2013, the offender was arraigned on an indictment charging him with the murder of his wife, Danuta Gierczynski, at Chipping Norton on 31 October 2010. He pleaded not guilty to murder and offered a plea of guilty to manslaughter. The Crown did not accept the plea in discharge of the charge on the indictment and he stood trial. The second charge on the indictment, to which he also pleaded not guilty, was that he wounded their son Daniel Gierczynski with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. On 18 July 2013 the jury returned verdicts convicting him of murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

2There was no dispute that the offender killed his wife. The issues in the trial were whether the Crown had excluded self-defence and provocation, whether the offender had established the partial defence of substantial impairment and whether the Crown had established the wounding charge beyond reasonable doubt. 

3At the time he murdered his wife, the offender and Danuta Gierczynski had been married for over 28 years.

Facts

4The offender and his wife met in Poland in 1981. They married in Austria in January 1982 and migrated to Australia on 24 March 1982. The following year their son, Daniel, was born. Danuta returned to work as a registered nurse not long after Daniel's birth. Their daughter, Angela, was born in 1988. When Daniel was seven, he was injured in a car accident as a result of which he suffered hemiplegia and brain damage. At that time Danuta stopped working for a period to look after Daniel and to assist in his rehabilitation.

5The household was dependent on Danuta's income as a registered nurse, but the offender nonetheless resented her working and feared that she was having an affair with one of her male colleagues. There is no evidence that his suspicions had any basis. Danuta's repeated assurances that she loved him and was faithful to him did not assuage his concerns. He complained to others, including friends and neighbours, about her presumed infidelity. 

6The offender was, at times, tyrannical. He threw food that he considered to be insufficiently hot and physically assaulted Danuta when things did not go his way. He blamed her if he lost at gambling or crashed the car. He also held her responsible for Daniel's accident on the grounds that if she had been a diligent mother it would not have happened.

7He was obsessed with his own sexual fulfilment. He used pornography and sought out prostitutes to satisfy his needs. At times he tried to find a permanent substitute for Danuta and courted at least one woman, Gina, with a view to a long-term relationship. He regarded his inability to maintain an erection as proof of her infidelity.

8He either deliberately refused to recognise, or was incapable of appreciating, the hypocrisy of his insisting that Danuta be not only faithful, but also confined within the home and chaperoned on journeys to the shops and to work, while he was regularly unfaithful to her and came and went at will. 

9He became fixated about a particular date in 1996 when he telephoned Danuta at work and she was not available to speak with him. He often reverted, in their regular arguments, to the topic of her whereabouts on that night. In 2006 the offender insisted that his wife no longer work night shifts and that she work on-call for an agency to minimise her opportunity to form a relationship. The offender was keen to find evidence of infidelity. He set traps for his wife by leaving marks on the surface of Vaseline in a jar in the bathroom. When he perceived that the marks had been disturbed, he charged her with deceiving him. He found an old hairpiece in her wardrobe and accused her of buying it and wearing it with another man.

10He regarded Danuta as a chattel and a servant for his exclusive use. The offender commandeered Danuta's income as well as her body. He not only used force to control her, but he also humiliated her to subjugate her. He inculcated such fear of his retaliation in Danuta and the children that they rarely contacted police or otherwise revealed his conduct to the outside world. When neighbours called the police, the offender, his wife and their children by and large adhered to the code of silence that the offender imposed on them and told the officers who came to the door that there was no need for them to intervene.

11On occasions Danuta had to have time off work because of bruising or injury, but where, as was more often the case, any physical marks could be concealed by clothing and make-up she continued to work notwithstanding the assaults. 

12I am satisfied that the offender appreciated the extent of the violence he inflicted on his wife in the course of their marriage. He knew that it was unacceptable for a man to assault a woman. His denials of violence towards her, such as in the following passage, were deliberately dishonest:
Q. Did you punch her? 
A. No, never. Just defend myself from, ever attack me many times, and I only just grabbed her hand, push her backwards, or if she start swinging her hands and I protect myself, fling back, and she's possible, maybe hit herself like that, because of my swing my hand, and I never ever ever attack her, never bash her up, never ever in my life. Only I defend myself. 

13On one occasion, over a decade before he killed Danuta, the offender required his wife to walk several times around the swimming pool of their Punchbowl home in the heat of the day, carrying a carpet cleaning machine. Angela, who was then a young child, showed her support for her mother by accompanying her as she trudged around the pool. The offender, the instigator and spectator of his wife's degradation, screamed abuse at her.

14The couple socialised with other Polish immigrants in their early years in Sydney but, at least from the time Angela was an infant, the offender became angry with his wife if she brought friends home or had any independent social life. As time went on, their social contact diminished. The offender's outbursts embarrassed onlookers and humiliated Danuta. The offender obstructed social contact, as he was reluctant to allow others into what he saw as his domain.

15In 2002 the Gierczynski family sold the house at Punchbowl. The offender took control of the entire proceeds of sale and used the money, together with the proceeds of his carpet cleaning business, for share trading and gambling. A new house at Chipping Norton was purchased in Daniel's name with damages he had received by way of settlement following the motor vehicle accident in which he had been injured as an infant. 

16Daniel, who could not work by reason of his physical and intellectual disabilities, was usually at home. He worked out in a gym constructed in the garage. As he grew older and stronger, he adopted the role of his mother's protector and would intervene to stop his father assaulting her, although Daniel rarely used force himself.

17Danuta considered leaving the offender but was fearful that, if she did so, he would kill her, as he had often threatened to do. She contemplated suicide as a means of escape. Two suicide notes were in evidence, one dated 27 October 2004 and the other dated 13 August 2010. She confided her fears to those of her work colleagues who had become friends. She was, however, unwilling to move out of the house because it was Daniel's home. She felt that Daniel still needed her support and attention because of his disability. She also believed that there was nowhere she could go where she would be safe from her husband.

18On the night of the offender's birthday in October 2005, he went out, became intoxicated and crashed his car on the way home. On his return he punched Danuta in the head and gave her a black eye, on the ground that if she had taken him out that night it would not have happened. Danuta, Daniel and Angela, who was just about to sit her final HSC exams, decided to leave together and take Danuta to a hospital for treatment for her injuries. 

19Police interviewed Danuta at Liverpool Hospital for the purpose of applying for an apprehended violence order (AVO). Some time later she attended the police station and withdrew her application. After staying with friends for a day or two, the three returned to the Chipping Norton house and peace was temporarily restored.

20In 2006 the offender took the first of several videos of his wife. His technique was to provoke her to lose her temper and then film her when she was enraged, in the mistaken belief that this would provide some ""evidence"" that would protect him in the future against any conviction if he were ever charged with assaulting her. He secreted the videos behind air-conditioning vents in the house. They were not discovered when search warrants were executed on the house at Chipping Norton. Their existence was revealed to police only when the offender's former solicitors disclosed their whereabouts. The videos depict Danuta screaming at the offender and, at times, holding a knife or knives. 

21The offender's voice, as recorded on the video films, was at all times calm. He retained his grasp of the video camera throughout. Even when Danuta was holding a knife or knives, he did not appear to be in any fear of attack. I find that Danuta held knives on these occasions because she was fearful that the offender would attack her. The offender's motive for creating the videos is revealed from the following commentary, addressed to his wife, which he recorded on one of his videos:
""Court will take into account that I have been always calm all my life talk quietly, while you are provoking me, screaming, running with a knife, stabbing.""

22At the end of 2006, the offender met a woman called Gina, whom he initially hoped would be a substitute for Danuta and ""look after"" him. He travelled to the United States with Gina, leaving Danuta at home with the two children. While the offender was away he rarely contacted his family. When Gina did not fulfil his expectations he came back to Danuta at the end of January 2007. He travelled with Gina to Malaysia in March 2007. He returned alone after eight days. 

23On the day of his homecoming he took photographs of Danuta's genitalia because he was convinced that she had been unfaithful to him while he was away with Gina. He insisted that a gynaecologist resolve the matter. On that day he also made one of the videos referred to above. The video showed that Danuta was very upset by the affair and outraged that he had photographed her private parts. She accused him on the video of turning her into a mad woman.

24On 4 November 2007, Danuta called the police after the offender grabbed a knife and pointed it at her. The offender was arrested and an interim AVO was ordered. In a statement made that evening at Liverpool Police Station, the offender referred to the argument on 26 March 2007, which the offender had videotaped, and alleged that both his wife and his son had run after him with long knives. He also stated that this had occurred again on the evening of 4 November 2007 and that he had been about to call the police, when Danuta had pre-empted him by telephoning the police herself. I do not accept his version.

25Before the hearing of the application for a final order, the offender got Daniel and Danuta to prepare false statements in which they accepted full responsibility for what had occurred on 4 November 2007. As a result, the charge for assault against the offender was dismissed and the interim AVO was revoked. 

26In early 2008 Danuta applied for a divorce, which was refused because it did not meet the relevant requirements. They continued to live together. On 29 May 2008 Danuta and the offender went on a holiday to Bali. Danuta returned to Australia early, after a couple of nights, following an argument. The offender remained there for about four weeks. Later that year the offender went to Indonesia for about six months and purchased a restaurant at Lombok. Danuta was with him for much of that time. She later told Angela that the offender had abused her and confiscated her passport so that she could not return to Australia by herself.

27The offender would often check up on his wife when she was at work. He repeatedly rang her to ascertain her whereabouts and often waited for her outside work. Danuta confided in colleagues that she was sick and tired of life with her husband and was thinking about leaving him but was scared.

28In 2009 the offender was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He was overcome with self-pity. Both Danuta and Angela accompanied him to various doctors' appointments and discussed treatment options with him. He cancelled a prostatectomy operation shortly before the scheduled date because he was concerned that it would adversely affect his virility. He asserted in evidence that I do not accept that his wife persuaded him not to have the operation because she wanted him to die. He also accused Danuta of trying to kill him by suggesting he cook a steak on the gas barbecue, when the gas bottle was leaking. That his wife was trying to kill him was advanced as one of the delusions that evidenced a mental illness which caused him to act as he did on 31 October 2010.

29From time to time the offender required Danuta to sign documents that purported to have the effect of conferring rights on him. For example on 30 April 2006, Danuta documented her agreement to pay the offender $400 per week for as long as she was working. The document also recorded her acknowledgement as to the reason why he was entitled to the weekly payment:
This has happened because I take full responsibility to what has occurred to him psychologically and I am aware that he is unable to work due to the depression I have caused him because I had given him over the past 15 years sleeping pills. Also in regards to going to mental hospital - Rozelle, I accused my husband for going there which I shouldn't have.

30Another note signed about two months before 31 October 2010, read as follows:
I, Danuta Gierczynski, wife of Andrej Gierczynski agree for him to go out any time and anywhere he wants to do it. I also agreed for ""sex"" once a month only.
P.S. I will not make any complaints when he gets back. I am anti-social and he misses his social life.
My husband promised me not to gamble and we will get divorced if I catch him gambling.

31The offender frequently predicted violence, if not homicide, in the house. Angela's evidence, which I accept, was:
He said that there would be bloodshed in our house one day, whether it's now, tomorrow, in a year's time. He said that what would I say as a witness and whose side would I take. 

32This conversation between the offender and Angela took place years before the murder.

33The offender prepared himself for the contingency that one day he would be charged at least with assaulting Danuta by making the videos already referred to. He also kept documents, such as the two examples referred to above, that his wife had signed at his insistence. I accept Angela's evidence that her father told Danuta that he had evidence that would ensure that she would be locked up in gaol. 

34The offender gave evidence that about 10 days before he killed his wife he had bought a tablet from an unnamed, unknown man on the street outside a public car park in Liverpool, who had promised him that it was superior to Viagra and would give him a long-lasting erection. He said that he had taken it the night before the killing because he and his wife seemed to be getting on well and he wanted to have sex with her. According to the offender the tablet had not had the desired effect. It caused him to hallucinate. He said that he had heard voices telling him to kill, which he attributed to the drug. I do not accept that he ever purchased the tablet or had any of the symptoms he described. 

Sunday 31 October 2010

35On the morning of Sunday 31 October 2010 Danuta and the offender were in the kitchen. Daniel was upstairs in his bedroom asleep until about 11am. Angela was away overnight in Melbourne. I do not accept the offender's account of what occurred that morning except where it is corroborated or against interest. I accept Mr Lloyd QC's submission on behalf of the applicant that the jury's verdict does not foreclose a finding that Danuta provoked him in some way, or that he attacked her believing that it was necessary for him to defend himself. It is necessary for me to find the facts, in so far as the evidence permits me to do so.

36I am not satisfied that Danuta provoked the offender before he attacked her or at any time in the course of the conflict between them on 31 October 2010. Nor am I satisfied that the offender was defending himself when he attacked her. Although the deceased managed to stab him once in the chest, this did not damage any organs and did not impede or retard his assault on her. I am not satisfied that her stabbing him was provocative or aggressive, as distinct from defensive. He knocked her to the floor and continued to stab her. He stabbed her several times in the face, head and neck when she was lying on the kitchen floor. 

37After Danuta was knocked to the ground, Daniel, who had heard his mother's scream from upstairs, came down to the kitchen and saw his father standing over his mother. The offender lunged at Daniel with the knife and wounded him to deter or disable him from interrupting. Because of Daniel's concern for his mother, he did not realise that he had been injured. The wounding of Daniel formed the basis for the second charge on the indictment.

38The offender returned to where Danuta was lying on the floor and passed the knife from his right hand to his left hand so that Daniel, who was disabled on one side, would not be able to stop him. Daniel resorted to grabbing his father's hair which he pulled with such force that a tuft came out by the roots and was later found on the kitchen floor. 

39The offender continued to stab his wife. One of the stab wounds penetrated her spinal cord. This had the effect of paralysing her and preventing her from breathing. She died shortly afterwards. At that point, the offender said, ""That's enough"". He went and sat on the couch and lit a cigarette. I am satisfied that the offender intended to kill his wife and not merely to cause her grievous bodily harm.

40The autopsy established the cause of death to be multiple stab wounds. There were 10 stab wounds to Danuta's head and neck, with associated injury to her upper spinal cord. There were 6 stab wounds to the chest, one of which had penetrated through to the chest cavity and injured the left lung which had caused bleeding and leakage of air into the chest cavity. She had also sustained a further stab wound to the crook of the right elbow. Her right hand had also been injured when she tried to defend herself from attack. There was also a knife wound to her left buttock and bruises on her face and her body.

Factors relevant to sentence

41I turn to the provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). In dealing with each of the offences I take into account the purposes of sentencing that are set out in s 3A which include punishment, specific and general deterrence, protection of the community, rehabilitation of the offender and a recognition of the harm done to the victims and to the community. 

42Section 21A of the Act requires the Court to take into account both the aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2) and the mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3) that are relevant and known to the Court, together with any other relevant matters.

Murder

Objective seriousness

43The sanctity of human life is of great significance. The unlawful and intentional taking of a human life is a heinous crime. 

44The offence of murder carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The applicable standard non-parole period (SNPP) is 20 years. The SNPP represents the non-parole period for a hypothetical offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (s 54A(2)) whereas the maximum sentence is to be given only in the most severe of cases. The SNPP and the maximum sentence are legislative guideposts that inform the exercise of sentencing discretion. The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending: Muldrock v The Queen (Muldrock) [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, at [27]. 

45The Crown did not contend that this murder is in the category of offences for which a life sentence ought be imposed.

46I am not satisfied that there was any substantial degree of forethought. The offender appears to have long contemplated that he might one day kill his wife. However, there was no indication in the days or weeks before, that he intended to kill her that weekend or at any particular time in the future, notwithstanding the elaborate, and misguided, steps he had taken to defend his position by secreting evidence which he considered would assist him in his eventual defence. Indeed Daniel's evidence, which I accept, was that the environment at home was, on the eve of the murder, ""all beautiful"".

47That the offence involved the actual use of a weapon, a knife, is an aggravating factor. 

48Mr Lloyd submitted on behalf of the offender that the objective seriousness of the offence was lower than the mid-range. The Crown submitted that it was in the middle of the range.

49I regard the objective seriousness of the offence as being above the middle of the range. The offender was a physically powerful man. Danuta was a relatively diminutive woman and weighed only 56 kgs. Her husband knew she was no physical match for him. He knew that Angela was away in Melbourne that weekend and that Daniel, who tended to rise late, was asleep upstairs. He also appreciated that the neighbours had grown accustomed to the sounds of Danuta's screaming during their arguments and were unlikely to intervene to come to her rescue if she screamed for help. Danuta was entirely at the mercy of the man she had spent her adult life loving, fearing, placating and appeasing. Although his level of planning was not substantial, the apprehension that she would die at his hands had hung over her for almost the entire length of their relationship.

50The method of killing was particularly violent. Danuta was vulnerable and posed no threat to the offender. Her last minutes of life must have been spent in terror, pain, despair and anxiety for the fate of her children, particularly Daniel, and for herself. 

Other matters relevant to sentencing including the offender's moral culpability and his subjective circumstances

The role of mental illness in the commission of the offence

51Mental illness is relevant to moral culpability and is, potentially, a significant matter in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. As Gleeson CJ said in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71:
In truth however, for the reasons given at the commencement of this judgment, the question of the relationship, if any, between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence, goes to circumstances of the individual case to be taken into account in the application of the relevant principles. The existence of such a causal relationship in a particular case does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence, any more than the absence of such a causal connection produces the automatic result that an offender will not receive a lesser sentence in a particular case. For example, the existence of a causal connection between the mental disorder and the offence might reduce the importance of general deterrence, and increase the importance of particular deterrence or of the need to protect the public. By the same token, there may be a case in which there is an absence of connection between the mental disorder and the commission of the offence for which a person is being sentenced, but the mental disorder may be very important to considerations of rehabilitation, or the need for treatment outside the prison system.

52The existence of a causal connection between a mental disorder and the commission of the offence is potentially a matter of some mitigation and, as such, the onus is on an offender to prove a causal connection on the balance of probabilities. Expert evidence is germane, and indeed usually required. This is a separate issue from the partial defence of substantial impairment, which was not established at trial, although the psychiatric evidence is relevant to both.

53I reject the Crown's submission that I should infer from the jury's verdict that the partial defence of substantial impairment failed because the jury was not satisfied that at the time of the killing the offender's capacity to control himself, understand events or tell right from wrong was substantially affected, once the effects of self-induced intoxication, if any, were disregarded. The jury's verdict is consistent with the jury's being satisfied of that matter but, nonetheless, its not regarding the impairment as so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter. I am obliged to accept that the jury appreciated that it needed to be satisfied of both matters since that is what s 23A of the Crimes Act 1900 requires, as was reflected in my directions: Demirok v The Queen [1977] HCA 21; 137 CLR 20 at 22 per Barwick CJ.

54The offender was examined by three psychiatrists: Dr Skinner, who gave evidence in the Crown case, and Drs Allnutt and Nielssen, who gave evidence in the offender's case. The opinions given by the doctors were based on the histories given to them by the offender, which I do not accept. Nonetheless, the psychiatric evidence assists in the determination whether there was a causal connection between mental illness and the offender's killing his wife.

55I accept the psychiatric evidence that the offender suffered from morbid jealousy in that he held at least an overvalued idea, which may at times have amounted to a delusion, that his wife was unfaithful to him. Sufferers of this condition have suspicions about their partner and keep trying to find evidence that the partner has been unfaithful. The offender's morbid jealousy led him to be unduly suspicious of Danuta's conduct and her movements. Dr Skinner did not consider his suspicions to be sufficiently fixed or bizarre to qualify as delusions. Dr Allnutt considered the offender's belief that his wife was unfaithful to span the rational and the irrational. He agreed that the belief was, of itself, not bizarre and that the forms of the beliefs were more consistent with overvalued ideas which fluctuated in intensity depending on his mood.

56The offender alleged before the murder, including in the videos he made, and in the trial that he thought that Danuta would kill him. I do not accept that he genuinely believed that she would and therefore it does not qualify as a delusion. Although Danuta, at times, threatened to kill him, I am satisfied that these threats were no more than hyperbolic expressions of frustration and irritation, which the offender understood as being no more than that. He revelled in collecting evidence that Danuta had wronged him. For example, he made much of the so-called barbecue incident. Yet he daily ate meals that she had prepared and was, as referred to above, perfectly calm on the videos he filmed when she had a knife in her hand and he had a camera in his. 

57The offender's lack of memory of what happened at the time of the killing does not establish mental illness at the time. Dr Allnutt gave possible explanations for the alleged amnesia, all of which were plausible in the present case, including that the offender did not want to remember, was trying to avoid a conviction for murder or that his revisiting the experience was too traumatic so he said he could not remember it.

58I do not accept that the offender was suffering from schizophrenia or any other schizoid disorder. To the extent that the psychiatric evidence suggested such a diagnosis, it was based on a foundation that has not been made out in the evidence.

59The offender has, throughout his life, shown a degree of selfishness and immaturity. I accept Dr Skinner's opinion that, although he craved affection and feared solitude, he did not have the emotional capacity to develop the kind of affectionate relationship that he wanted because he did not have that model in his life. Dr Skinner explained that the offender's feelings towards his wife were ambivalent in that he believed he loved her and wanted her affection and yet he felt that she was not providing him with what he needed and wanted. This led to his placing wholly unreasonable demands on her for sex, affection and domestic perfection.

60It is possible that the offender attacked Danuta on the morning of 31 October 2010 because she was not behaving entirely in accordance with his demands. He may have punched her as a result of his own frustration and, when she used a knife to defend herself, he may have been so outraged by her defiance that he killed her. These, however, are matters of speculation. Since I do not accept the offender's evidence, and since he is the only surviving witness of what occurred in the kitchen on 31 October 2010 before Daniel came downstairs, it is not possible to make definite findings as to precisely how the altercation occurred, much less what precipitated the final, fatal conflict between them.

61The Crown accepted that there was some causal connection between the offender's morbid jealousy and the anger the offender exhibited towards his wife that resulted in his attacking and killing her. In light of the whole of the evidence of their relationship, this concession was reasonable. However, I am not satisfied that the morbid jealousy from which the offender suffered impaired in any substantial way either his ability to understand events, to control himself or to tell right from wrong on 31 October 2010. I accept that his morbid jealousy compromised his insight to some degree, although not substantially, and take this into account in mitigation on sentence.

Moral culpability

62As sentencing judge I must assess the moral culpability of the offender, which is a separate matter from the objective seriousness of the offence: McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29] per McCallum J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing. This requires a consideration not only of the facts relating to the commission of the offence, but also those that shed light on why it was committed. 

63Why the offender killed Danuta on that morning and not on any other occasion is not revealed by the evidence. He had assaulted her on prior occasions without her having done or said anything that could conceivably be regarded as provocation. Although Daniel heard her screaming from upstairs, she may have been screaming as a result of the assault rather than in the course of an antecedent argument. I do not accept what I understood Mr Lloyd's submission to be, that because it was the first time he had used a knife against her, there must have been some provocation. I am not persuaded that there was any provocation by Danuta or that she initiated the attack. I do not consider there to have been any element of self-defence in the offender's conduct towards her. Although I am satisfied that she stabbed him with a knife, I find that this was in response to his aggression. 

64The offender's violence towards Danuta throughout their marriage and in the final minutes of her life was, in my view, an expression of his desire to exert his power over her because she was his wife. When she complied with his demands he was happy; when she did not meet his unreasonable standards or accede to his every wish, he retaliated, at times violently. Mr Lloyd's description of the relationship as ""tumultuous"" may be accepted, but I reject the suggestion that Danuta was responsible for the conflict, rather than an unwilling victim of it. That she was sometimes driven to react was an indication of the extent of his provocation throughout their marriage. In so far as she ""reacted"" in the period immediately before her death, it was to try to defend her own life, as best she could.

Other sentences imposed in such cases

65Both the Crown and Mr Lloyd referred me to several judgments where a male offender has been sentenced for the murder of a woman with whom he was, or has been, in an intimate relationship. There is a substantial sub-category of such cases where the relevant weapon was, as here, a knife such as might be found in any domestic kitchen. I have read and considered those cases, some of which were decided before the introduction of the SNPP for murder. I am conscious that each case is to be determined by reference to its own facts and also to the circumstances pertaining to the individual offender. 

66However, the prevalence of such cases demonstrates that Andrzej Gierczynski is not the first man to consider himself to be entitled to exert absolute power and control over his wife. Such men, as the cases (including the present) demonstrate, behave as if the protection that the law extends to strangers does not extend to their intimates. They act as if they were a law unto themselves in their own homes and were not subject to the criminal law of the society in which they live. They may justify or excuse their conduct by relying on morbid jealousy as if infidelity, whether real or imagined, were ever an excuse for violence. They use their physical superiority to tyrannise and subjugate. Mr Gierczynski, and others of this kind, must be disabused of this misapprehension. The deceased's loved ones, as well as society as a whole, need to be reassured by the sentences imposed that such men are not entitled to any form of domestic immunity. The community ought not need reminding that the home is a sanctuary, not a fortress within which violence and abuse can be perpetrated without exposure or consequences.

Prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of re-offending

67As for the offender's prospects of rehabilitation, I do not consider that he poses any particular danger to anyone other than any, and perhaps every, woman with whom he is in an intimate relationship. I am not persuaded that he will ever regard any such woman as a fellow human being, who is an equal and deserving of respect, as distinct from a chattel for his exclusive use and control, to be dominated where necessary by threats of violence or actual violence.

68Mr Lloyd submitted that the likelihood of the offender's re-offending was remote because his advanced age when released from custody after expiry of the non-parole period would make it improbable that he would form another intimate relationship. I reject that submission. As Gleeson CJ said in De Sales v Ingrilli [2002] HCA 52; [2003] HCA 16; 212 CLR 338 at [29]:
Attempts by courts to make a subjective assessment of a particular claimant's chances of remarriage are also fraught with danger. In most cases, courts cannot safely predict, either from statistics or a subjective assessment of the claimant in court, whether the claimant is more or less likely than any other person to remarry.

69I do not regard the offender's prospects of rehabilitation as good. The pattern of his behaviour towards Danuta was intractable although the frequency of violence waxed and waned and there were good times as well as bad. The evidence indicated that his relationship with Gina, although short-lived, was also problematic.

70I am not satisfied that the offender feels any remorse for killing his wife except in so far as it has caused him loss. Any tears he has shed are the product of self-pity and, possibly, a degree of sympathy for Angela and Daniel who have, by their father's acts, forever been deprived of their mother's love and support. I regard his story about taking the tablet as a concoction. His version that he had heard a voice or seen images was, in my view, nothing more than a cynical and desperate attempt to avoid the consequences of his actions. I am satisfied that his accusation that his wife had stabbed him first was deliberately false.

Previous convictions/ character of the accused

71The Crown tendered documents from Poland that were located in the offender's house that showed that the offender was prosecuted in Poland for assault against his first wife and received an 18-month period of imprisonment. His appeal against sentence appears to have been allowed and he was released on a bond on 12 February 1981 after having been imprisoned on 15 July 1980. Accordingly he served about 7 months of his 18-month term in prison. The indictment summarised the offences which are said to have occurred between 11 January 1976 and the beginning of 1977 which involved his beating his wife and threatening to kill her. 

72The offender gave evidence at the sentence hearing that the charges had no substance, that he was charged because his first wife's family were senior in the Communist Party and that the regime was corrupt. I do not accept his evidence.

73The offender relied on his lack of criminal record in Australia as a mitigating factor in the sentence.

74The offender's behaviour as described in the Polish indictment for which he was convicted is consistent with his behaviour towards his second wife, Danuta. It does not particularly add to my view of the danger he would pose to the community.

75I do not consider the offender's lack of criminal record in Australia to be a mitigating factor of any weight in the circumstances of the present case. The evidence at trial was replete with examples of his violent conduct towards Danuta, which did not result in prosecution because on each occasion he persuaded Danuta, either by intimidating her or manipulating her love for him, not to give evidence against him, to lie to the police about what happened or not to report his assaults to the police at all. 

76His conduct towards Danuta for 28 years and his interference with the reporting by her and his children of his assaults deprive him of the benefit of the suggestion that, but for the murder, he was otherwise of good character.

The offer to plead guilty to manslaughter

77By letter dated 7 May 2012 the offender's then solicitors wrote to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions attaching a report of Dr Nielssen dated 1 November 2011. They informed the DPP that they were instructed to offer pleas of guilty to manslaughter and reckless wounding. The offer of manslaughter was based on provocation and/ or substantial impairment of mental responsibility. Mr Lloyd contended that this showed the offender's acceptance of responsibility for killing his wife and that this ought be taken into account in mitigation. 

78The offender's offer to plead guilty to manslaughter showed, in my view, no more than hopeful pragmatism. The killing was witnessed by his son. The offender was the only relevant suspect. When the ambulance and police arrived, the offender still had blood on his hands. The plea did not indicate any true acknowledgment of responsibility, much less remorse. Since the plea was not accepted by the Crown it had no utilitarian value: the Crown was required to prove every element of murder beyond reasonable doubt and it remained within the power of the jury to acquit him both of murder and the alternative count of manslaughter: Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; 124 CLR 107 at 132-133 per Menzies J.

Wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm

79The maximum penalty for the wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm is 25 years' imprisonment. The SNPP is 7 years.

80The Crown conceded that the only relevant intent was the intent to cause grievous bodily harm to Danuta and that Daniel was injured because he got in the way. The wounding of Daniel was incidental and impulsive. There was no degree of planning.

81There should be a substantial degree of concurrence because the wounding of Daniel was substantially related to the murder of Danuta but it is, in my view, necessary that there be some accumulation to take account of the total criminality.

82I am obliged by s 54B(4A) of the Act to specify a non-parole period for this offence.

Subjective circumstances

83The offender was born in Gubin, Poland on 6 October 1952. He was the fourth of five children. His father, an alcoholic who resorted to violence, spent some time in a mental hospital. I do not accept the offender's evidence that his mother cut his throat, although I accept that his childhood was unhappy and that he entered adulthood lacking emotional maturity. He left school at 14 and went to a technical college where he trained to be a fitter. He became fully qualified at 18. He married and had a son. He separated from his first wife and met Danuta who was already a registered nurse in Poland.

84As I have said, the couple migrated to Australia, established themselves, had two children and bought a house in Punchbowl and later lived in Chipping Norton. The offender had a carpet cleaning business which he sold in about 2002. He traded in shares and gambled. His expenses were often met either from resort to the proceeds of the Punchbowl house or from his wife's income. 

85Notwithstanding the offender's odd behaviour as far as his relationship with his wife was concerned, he was capable of presenting as a charming, worldly man who was fond of poker, travel and business ventures, including overseas. Indeed, shortly before the murder he was negotiating a venture in Indonesia. Photographs were in evidence that showed the offender and Danuta in various exotic locations as a happy, relaxed couple. The evidence revealed a dark underside to those images.

86The offender is now 61 years of age. He has long suffered from insomnia and anxiety. He has been in custody since his arrest on 31 October 2010. He resides in the hospital section of the prison because of his mental health. His mental state prior to the murder has been addressed in the reasons above. I am satisfied that there has been some decompensation due to the murder, the loss of Danuta, the absence of the children and the need to adjust to the prison environment.

Special circumstances

87The offender submitted that this will, effectively, be the offender's first custodial term, because his incarceration in Poland was so long ago. He contended that for this reason, and because of his mental health and age, there were special circumstances which created a need for him to have a longer than usual period on parole.

88I am not persuaded that there are special circumstances in the instant case. Nor am I persuaded that if I had found special circumstances there would be any proper basis to disturb the ratio. The non-parole period needs to be of sufficient length having regard to the factors referred to above, of which the most significant are the objective seriousness of the offence and the need to protect the public. The desirability of having a parole period of some length to assist the offender to live in the community is also accommodated because of the length of the overall sentence.

89The effect of accumulation requires an adjustment to the statutory ratio that would otherwise apply with respect to the sentence for murder, in order to preserve the statutory ratio for the overall sentence: s 44(2B) of the Act.

Totality, accumulation and concurrency

90I am required to arrive at a total sentence that reflects the overall criminality of the offences committed: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610.

91The two offences were committed on the same occasion and form part of the same event. It is appropriate that there be a substantial degree of concurrence in the sentence. However, there should, in my view, be some partial accumulation to take account of both offences. 

92I am obliged to take into account time spent in custody. The offender has been in custody since he was arrested on 31 October 2010. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the sentence be backdated so as to commence on that date.

Loss of the deceased

93The Crown provided a Victim Impact Statement from Angela Gierczynski who described her feelings of grief at the loss of her mother and the magnitude of the responsibility she now bears, alone, to look after Daniel.

94Under the law, the loss suffered by the deceased and her loved ones cannot be reflected by any sentence I impose. However, before I impose a sentence, I wish to pause to acknowledge the loss of Danuta Gierczynski to her children and to her friends. I take this opportunity, on behalf of the Court, to extend my sympathies to all those to whom she was dear.

95Retribution is one of the many aspects of punishment and is particularly significant when a life has been taken. However, under laws that have been in existence for a long time now, the loss suffered by the deceased and her family cannot be reflected in any sentence I impose. I am conscious of the observations of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 87-88. It is the approach that I adopt.

Sentence

96Andrzej Gierczynski:

(1)For the offence of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for three years, to date from 31 October 2010 with a non-parole period of two years and three months .

(2)For the murder of Danuta Gierczynski, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 28 years, commencing 30 April 2011, with a non-parole period of 21 years and 4 months.

The earliest date upon which you are eligible for release on parole is 31 August 2032.

2705709,R v Filihia [2013] NSWSC 1871,"Judgment

Introduction
1In the early hours of Wednesday 24 October 2012 in a brothel in George Street, Clyde, Richard Filihia stabbed and robbed Brian Gaudry who died as a result of the wound. Later that day Mr Filihia was arrested and charged with murder and armed robbery. He pleaded guilty to both charges. He was committed for sentence upon entering the pleas. He was arraigned on 2 August 2013. His sentence was deferred until the completion of the trial of Mr Sio, a co-offender, who had planned the robbery, investigated the layout of the brothel, driven him to the scene and supplied him with clothes in which to commit the robbery as well as providing him with a large hunting knife to use in the robbery.

2Mr Sio was convicted of armed robbery and acquitted of murder. The factual basis of his sentence derives from the evidence at the trial and on the sentence hearing. It is slightly different from the facts set out below, which are largely taken from the Statement of Facts prepared by the Crown and agreed by the offender (the Agreed Facts), as well as admissions made in the Electronically Recorded Interview with Suspected Person (ERISP), some of which are extracted in the Agreed Facts. 

3I have had regard to the principles of parity when sentencing Mr Sio and Mr Filihia, paying due regard to the fact that Mr Filihia is to be sentenced for murder and armed robbery with wounding but Mr Sio is to be sentenced only for armed robbery with wounding. 

Evidence

4I have also taken into account the evidence at the sentence hearing. In addition to the ERISP and the Agreed Statement of Facts, the Crown tendered the offender's criminal and custodial histories, a photograph of the knife and the autopsy report as well as closed circuit television (CCTV) footage. The brothel was fitted with cameras both inside and outside. The entire incident was captured on CCTV footage. 

5Mr Winch, who appeared on behalf of the offender tendered:
(1)a report of Ms Robilliard, psychologist dated 11 September 2013;

(2)certificates showing completion of various courses undertaken in custody; and

(3)a letter from the offender to the deceased's family.

Facts

6Mr Gaudry worked as a receptionist for a brothel in George Street, Clyde. The brothel was open 24 hours a day. 

7In October 2012 Mr Filihia lived with his partner and their four children at Carss Park Motel, a facility used by the Department of Housing. Mr Filihia was addicted to methylamphetamine, commonly known as ice. In the early hours of Wednesday 24 October 2012, Daniel Sio and Sarah Coffison, both of whom were known to Mr Filihia, drove to Carss Park, where Mr Filihia met them outside the hotel. Ice was supplied to Mr Filihia, who smoked it, as did Mr Sio and Ms Coffison.

8While they were smoking ice in the car, Mr Sio told Mr Filihia that he was under financial pressure and that he was going to drop Ms Coffison home and pick up someone in Cronulla to rob a brothel. Mr Sio commented that it would be a relatively easy job as one of the sex-workers was helping and the receptionist would not offer resistance. Mr Filihia, who also needed money to support both his family and his ice habit, volunteered to be involved in the robbery.

9After this discussion, Mr Sio drove Ms Coffison and Mr Filihia to a park where he let them out of the car and drove off. When he returned a short time later he handed some clothes to Mr Filihia for him to put on over what he was wearing. Mr Sio described the layout of the brothel and told him that the receptionist kept the takings in his back pocket in a pencil case.

10When they reached George Street, Clyde at 5.08am Mr Sio gave Mr Filihia a large 'Crocodile Dundee-style' knife. The knife belonged to Mr O'Hare, a temporary lodger at Ms Coffison's house. Mr Sio reversed his car into a driveway in George Street some distance away from the brothel. He and Ms Coffison remained in the car, leaving it to Mr Filihia to commit the robbery.

11Mr Filihia pressed the doorbell and was allowed to enter by Mr Gaudry. Mr Filihia waited in the reception area and spoke with Mr Gaudry. He also spoke with a sex worker. After she had left the room, Mr Filihia spoke again with Mr Gaudry. The sex worker returned to the room and spoke with Mr Filihia before leaving again. Mr Gaudry motioned to him along the hallway in the direction of the sex worker. At this point, Mr Filihia withdrew a knife with his right hand from the inside of his hooded jumper and pointed it towards Mr Gaudry who reached out with his left hand several times to ward off the offender. Mr Filihia pulled the hood of his jumper over his head and advanced towards Mr Gaudry. They moved into the office area off the hallway.

12Mr Filihia pushed the deceased backwards with his left arm against his face. The deceased grabbed Mr Filihia's left sleeve with his right arm. The deceased stepped back and fell to the ground. Mr Filihia then struck the deceased on the head with the butt of the knife. The deceased managed to stand up. He tried to defend himself by pushing and grabbing onto his assailant's clothing. The struggle continued until Mr Filihia stabbed Mr Gaudry in the left side of the chest.

13Mr Gaudry tried to follow Mr Filihia who was heading to the exit. He collapsed on the way. When Mr Filihia turned and saw Mr Gaudry on the floor he ran back and ripped the pencil case from his back pocket. The pencil case contained the cash takings of the brothel. The amount is unknown but is believed to be $500.

14Mr Filihia ran out of the brothel and straight past Mr Sio's car. Mr Sio started the car and caught up with the offender. Once Mr Filihia was inside the car, Mr Sio accelerated sharply away from the scene. On the way back to Carss Park Motel they stopped at a park where Mr Filihia disposed of the clothes Mr Sio had given him to wear for the robbery.

15A witness called Triple-0 and attempted to resuscitate Mr Gaudry. Ambulance officers arrived and took him to Westmead Hospital. Soon after his arrival his life was pronounced extinct.

16A post mortem examination confirmed that Mr Gaudry died of a single stab wound to the left side of his ribs that penetrated his left lung, heart and the pulmonary artery.

17CCTV footage from the brothel and its surrounds was downloaded. Images of Mr Filihia were obtained and circulated to police around New South Wales. When Mr Filihia reported to Hurstville Police Station at 6.45pm that evening, in compliance with his bail conditions for an unrelated offence, he was arrested.

18That evening police interviewed Mr Filihia. He made detailed admissions, including that he went to the brothel with the intention of committing an armed robbery and that he had stabbed the deceased. Although he initially referred to Mr Sio as ""Jacob"" in the interview, he later, inadvertently, mentioned 'Dan' or 'Danny' as the person who had arranged the robbery. He disclosed Mr Sio's mobile phone number to police and told them that he was the person who had provided the knife, driven him to the brothel, informed him of the layout of the brothel and the location of the cash. The following day he identified Mr Sio in a photograph identification parade and gave his correct name.

19On Friday 26 October 2012 Mr Sio was arrested and charged.

Factors relevant to sentence

20The purposes of sentencing include punishment, specific and general deterrence, protection of the community, rehabilitation of the offender and recognition of the harm done to the victim and to the community. 

Objective seriousness

21The offence of murder carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. The applicable standard non-parole period (SNPP) is 20 years. The offence of armed robbery with wounding carries a maximum penalty of 25 years' imprisonment and a SNPP of 7 years. The SNPP and the maximum sentence are relevant considerations in the exercise of the sentencing discretion: Muldrock v The Queen (Muldrock) [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, at [27]. 

22The sanctity of human life is of great significance. The unlawful taking of a human life is a heinous crime. 

23Mr Filihia's plea has the effect that he admits, at least, that when he killed the deceased he either intended to cause him grievous bodily harm or acted with reckless indifference to human life or that he killed him in the course of an armed robbery. 

24Armed robbery is an offence that is commonly committed by young offenders with drug habits and a concomitant need for cash. When death ensues as a result, a terrible disparity arises between the loss of life of an innocent person and the paltry sum for which the crime was committed. General deterrence is of particular significance.

25I accept that Mr Filihia hoped that disclosing the knife would engender sufficient fear in Mr Gaudry to make him hand over the cash. However, I am satisfied that, at the moment Mr Filihia stabbed Mr Gaudry, he intended to cause him grievous bodily harm so as to disable him from fighting back and render him unable to protect the cash in his back pocket.

26Mr Gaudry was particularly vulnerable to the type of attack that occurred. He was virtually alone in premises that were open 24-hours a day to provide services in an industrial area, in circumstances where it would reasonably be inferred that there was cash on the premises. The women on the premises were not able to save him. Nor were the numerous CCTV cameras that recorded his demise of any use in protecting him from attack.

27I accept that Mr Filihia committed the murder in a state of panic when he stabbed Mr Gaudry. However, there was a degree of planning associated with the armed robbery in that Mr Filihia volunteered to take part in it when Mr Sio first mentioned the proposal in the car outside the Carss Park Motel. He knew when he got out of the car in George Street that his task was to steal the available cash from the brothel.

28That the offence involved the use of a dangerous weapon, a substantial hunting knife, is an aggravating factor in the murder. Although I am not satisfied that Mr Filihia was provided with the knife before they arrived in George Street, he must have realised when he saw it that it was a serious weapon that could do considerable harm if the victim resisted handing over the money and he was required to use it rather than merely threaten its use. His belief that he could obtain easy money by committing an armed robbery to support his drug habit proved to be mistaken when Mr Gaudry resisted his attack to protect the cash takings. 

29Mr Winch submitted that the aggravating effect of the use of the knife was outweighed by the circumstance that there was a single stab wound. I do not see it that way. That a single stab wound was sufficient to kill Mr Gaudry demonstrates what dangerous weapons knives, and particularly this one, can be and the seriousness of an armed robbery with such a weapon.

Other matters relevant to sentencing including the offender's moral culpability and his subjective circumstances

30As sentencing judge I must assess the moral culpability of the offender, which is a separate matter from the objective seriousness of the offence: McLaren v R [2012] NSWCCA 284 at [29] per McCallum J, McClellan CJ at CL and Bellew J agreeing. This requires a consideration, not only of the facts relating to the commission of the offence, but also those that shed light on why it was committed. Mr Filihia's motive in committing the armed robbery, but not the murder, was financial. He urgently needed cash to support his ice habit, including to pay for the ice he and his partner had smoked in Mr Sio's car that morning. This explains, but does not mitigate, his criminal conduct. 

31I accept that he also wanted money to house his family because he felt ashamed that they were living in a welfare hotel rather than in their own house. However, I do not consider that providing for his family, rather than paying for drugs, was a substantial incentive for the robbery.

32His record of prior offending is an aggravating factor, although most of it occurred when he was a juvenile and reflects the difficulty he was having with drugs and alcohol at a young age arising from the departure of his father from the family home. He was first before the Children's Court in 2004 when he was 14. Justice demands that some allowance be made for life's adversities, particularly when they arose from occurrences in his youth over which he had no control.

33It is an aggravating factor that the offence was committed while the offender was on conditional liberty. He was on bail from 2 August 2012 for the offence of intimidate police officer. He was also subject to the following three bonds under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 imposed on 10 July 2012:

(1)Section 12 bond following a 10-month suspended sentence for receive stolen property and dispose of stolen property;

(2)Section 12 bond imposed after call up on s 9 bond imposed following a six-month suspended sentence for custody of an offensive implement in a public place; and

(3)12-month s 9 bond imposed for possess prohibited drug.

Remorse

34Remorse shown by the offender for the offence is a mitigating factor. Mr Filihia gave evidence at the sentence hearing. He read a letter of apology to Mr Gaudry's family in open court. A copy was tendered and the original and copies given to those members of Mr Gaudry's family who were present. I am satisfied that the remorse shown by Mr Filihia in the recorded interview on 24 October 2012 and in his evidence at the sentence hearing is genuine. I am satisfied that he has accepted full responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the loss he has caused. I accept that the contents of the letter reproduced below are true:

To the Family of Brian,
First and foremost my intention to write to you was to express my deepest condolences. I cowardly, tragically took a life in my drug induced way. There is not a day that goes by that I don't think of Brian, he didn't deserve what I done to him. Every night, I think to myself why, why if I could take his place I would. 
I am sorry for all the pain and heartache I have caused to all Brian's family. I accept full responsibility for what I have done. I am the father of 6 children, 7 yrs ago I lost my 1th [sic, 1st] child and that crushed me to the point of depression. Even today I still try and ask God why he took my child away, so I can relate to the pain and heartache you all must be feeling. I no [sic] my apology won't bring him back. I just needed to say I'm sorry. If you are willing to confront me threw [sic] a meeting that could be organized [sic] threw [sic] corrective services. I would be willing to answer any questions you may have for me. If I could help ease the pain in any way possible I would gladly be of any assistance. 
I made the biggest mistake of my life, I know that I will now pay for what I have done. My kids will suffer for my actions, so I'm still living with regreat, [sic] heartache, and this pain I have that I can't describe. I don't think the pain will subside any time now, I will have to live with all the nightmares. I have, and all this I deserve. I hope you can accept my apology, I will understand if you don't. To all Brian's family and loves ones I am truly sorry for taking Brian away from you.
Thank you for listening to my letter. It's much appreciated, may God Bless You All. 
Yours Sincerely. Richie

35I am satisfied that, as long as he can overcome his drug addiction, Mr Filihia has good prospects of rehabilitation. His guilt and remorse for killing Mr Gaudry will be a powerful incentive. However, he has been taking drugs since his early teens, and it is likely to be difficult for him on release to resist the temptation of resorting to drugs since his habit is of such long-standing. During his time in custody he has completed courses in acquiring skills for work and training, developing positive attitudes and motivation, hospitality, maintaining workplace hygiene and preparing and serving espresso coffee. He has also completed a course in visual arts. 

36I accept that Mr Filihia genuinely intends to qualify himself in whatever ways are available to him in gaol and that he is willing to undertake drug rehabilitation.

Assistance to authorities

37Where an offender has assisted law enforcement authorities in the detection or investigation of an offence or offences I am entitled to impose a lesser sentence than I would otherwise have imposed as long as the sentence is not thereby rendered unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.

38Mr Winch submitted that the sentence to be imposed ought take account of the assistance that Mr Filihia provided to police. In his ERISP he gave a detailed version of what occurred. Although he did not disclose the presence of Ms Coffison, he gave police Mr Sio's mobile phone number and identified him on the following day in a photograph and by name. His initial attempts to give a false name for Mr Sio were clumsy and easily detected by the police. At the time he was interviewed he could not have appreciated the extent to which what he was describing was visible from the numerous CCTV cameras in and surrounding the brothel and along George Street. 

39In my view the assistance Mr Filihia gave on the day of the offence and the following day was significant and useful. It enabled the police to find Mr Sio quickly and obtain his mobile phone, which in turn led to other witnesses, including Ms Coffison, being interviewed. Apart from Mr Sio's name, his evidence was truthful and reliable. It was complete in that he endeavoured to answer every question asked of him in a lengthy interview.

40However, the assistance that Mr Filihia gave to the authorities did not extend to giving evidence for the Crown at the trial of Mr Sio, in respect of which Mr Filihia was a compellable witness. He refused on 9 September 2013 in a voir dire to answer questions as a Crown witness. He was required to attend court again on 11 September 2013 since Mr Sio's counsel contended that Mr Filihia was prepared to give evidence for the defence. However it was clear from his responses that he would not answer questions put by the Crown, whether in examination-in-chief or cross-examination. He gave his concern for his family as the reason for his refusal. This does not overcome the fact that his assistance was limited to the past assistance he had given. 

41I consider there should be a discount for the assistance that Mr Filihia has provided to the authorities. In my view the appropriate discount for such assistance is 10%. But for this discount, and the discount I propose to allow for his plea of guilty which will be addressed below, I would have imposed a sentence of a total term of 22 years with a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months for murder and a sentence of a total term of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months for armed robbery with wounding.

Plea of guilty

42I am required to take into account the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty as well as the time and circumstances in which he did so. A plea of guilty entitles me to impose a lesser sentence than I would otherwise have imposed as long as the sentence is not thereby rendered unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. The discount for the utilitarian value of the plea is largely determined by its timing.

43The Crown accepts that the offender ought be regarded as having pleaded at the earliest available opportunity. 

44In my view, the appropriate discount for the utilitarian value of the plea is 25%. But for this discount, and the discount I allow for his assistance to authorities which is referred to above, I would have imposed a sentence of a total term of 22 years with a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months for murder and a sentence of a total term of 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months for armed robbery with wounding.

Time in custody, concurrence and accumulation

45It is accepted by the Crown that the sentence for armed robbery with wounding should be wholly concurrent with the sentence for murder.

46On 18 December 2012 Mr Filihia was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment for intimidate police officer in the execution of his duty (the offence for which he was on bail at the time of the murder). The sentences that had earlier been suspended gave rise to an effective sentence of 10 months that commenced on 18 December 2012 and expired on 17 October 2013, with a 6 month non-parole period that expired on 17 June 2013. Accordingly, the time he has spent in custody referable to the offences of murder and armed robbery is in the order of 8 months: 55 days from 24 October 2012 until 18 December 2012 and 179 days from 18 June 2013 to date, being a total of 234 days.

47The Crown submitted that the sentences for the present offences ought commence on 18 June 2013, being the day after the expiry of the non-parole period for the offences for which the sentences commenced on 18 December 2012, less the time served between the offender's arrest on 24 October 2012 and 17 December 2012 inclusive, which is referable to the offences for which I am to sentence him. This would give an effective commencement date of 13 April 2013. 

48Mr Winch submitted that the sentence for the present offences ought commence on the date of arrest, 24 October 2012.

49There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought be dealt with concurrently or consecutively. The principle of totality is an overriding principle by reference to which sentences are to be measured. It requires the sentencing judge to consider the total criminality involved, not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, but also in any offences for which the offender has already been sentenced: Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 at 308 per McHugh J.

50The criminality involved in the offences for which Mr Filihia was in custody from 18 December 2012 until 17 June 2013 was separate from the criminality involved in the present offences, although the underlying cause of the criminality, his drug addiction, may have been the same.

51In my view, the principle of totality is best advanced by allowing a degree of concurrence between the sentences for the present offences and the earlier offences. I propose to commence the current sentence on 13 March 2013. The sentences for murder and armed robbery will be wholly concurrent.

Subjective circumstances

52Mr Filihia is 22 years old. His parents came from Tonga to New Zealand where he was born. In his formative years, the home was an unhappy place due to his father's heavy drinking and violence towards Mr Filihia's mother. The offender's position as the eldest in a family of 5 boys and 2 girls made him feel responsible for his siblings. Following violent attacks he would take his siblings to his maternal grandmother's house nearby. For a time, his parents reconciled after these episodes. When Mr Filihia was 12 his father left again. This time his mother packed up her husband's belongings and announced that she was divorcing him, which she did.

53In the absence of his father, Mr Filihia stepped into the role of carer for his younger siblings while his mother was at work at Woolworths, East Gardens. He felt aggrieved by his greater responsibilities and became resentful. He was expelled from Randwick Boys High School in Year 7. He was then enrolled at Edgware in Hurlstone Park, a school for children with behavioural disorders. He attended only for a short time, preferring to associate with his peers in the streets. He had no further formal education or vocational training until he was taken into custody. He started smoking cannabis at 13 and committed crime so that he could afford it. He took ice from the age of 14 and continued to take it until October 2012.

54At the age of 14, Mr Filihia met Tara-Lee, who is still his partner. When he was about 16, Tara-Lee gave birth to their first child, who died at 8 weeks of cot death. They have 5 living children: boys aged 6, 5, 3 and 2 and a daughter aged 4 months. Throughout their relationship, they have lived with Tara-Lee's parents, except for the period about a month prior to the present offences when the young family lived in a motel room at Blakehurst and then at Carss Park Motel. There have, however, been periods when Mr Filihia has lived separately because of his drug taking.

55After his parents' divorce he had little contact with his father until, at 16, he renewed contact. He worked with his father in an equipment hire company from the age of 16 until he was 20. During this period their relationship repaired. In 2011 he obtained employment as a wharf labourer at Port Botany, where he worked for almost a year. He resigned in December 2011 and did not seek subsequent employment because his second youngest son was born with a cleft palate and he felt his wife needed support. The family managed on benefits and some savings.

56Both his father and his mother have visited him in gaol. Although they are disappointed in him, they remain supportive.

57I accept Ms Robilliard's opinion that his symptoms are consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder and associated depression. She noted the offender's positive attitude towards professional intervention.

Special circumstances

58It was submitted on behalf of the offender that there were special circumstances. I am not persuaded that Mr Filihia's circumstances are special. The non-parole period needs to be of sufficient length having regard to the factors referred to above, of which the most significant are the objective seriousness of the offence and the need to protect the public. The length of the overall sentence accommodates the desirability of having a parole period of some length to assist the offender to adjust to life in the community.

59I do not propose to factor in the time in custody prior to the effective date of commencement of 13 March 2013 in calculating the non-parole period for the current offences. Such calculation is not required by s 44(2) or s 44(2B) of the Act.

Loss of the deceased

60The deceased's wife and children provided statements to the Court in which they told of the effect on them of the deceased's death. Such statements bear witness to the grief, pain and loss suffered by those who survive the deceased. 

61Under the law, the loss suffered by the deceased and his loved ones cannot be reflected by any sentence I impose. However, before I impose a sentence, I wish to pause to acknowledge the loss of Brian Gaudry to his wife, his children and to the other members of his family and to his friends. I take this opportunity to extend, on behalf of the Court, my condolences to them. I hope that they feel some benefit in having their loss acknowledged in a public way.

62Retribution is one of the many aspects of punishment and is particularly significant when a life has been taken. However, under laws that have been in existence for a long time now, the loss suffered by the deceased and his family cannot be reflected by any sentence I impose: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 87-88 per Hunt CJ at CL.

Sentence

63Richard Filihia:

(1)For the offence of armed robbery with wounding, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for 6 years and 6 months, commencing on 13 March 2013, with a non-parole period of 4 years and 10 months.

(2)For the murder of Brian Gaudry, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 14 years and 3 months, commencing 13 March 2013, with a non-parole period of 10 years and 8 months.

The earliest date upon which you are eligible for release on parole is 13 November 2023.

2705719,"BLOOMFIELD, Gary v R [2013] NSWCCA 315","Judgment

1LATHAM J: I agree with Rothman J. 

2ROTHMAN J: Gary Robert Bloomfield, the Applicant, applies to this Court for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by the District Court for the offence of robbery in company (being contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900), which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment. The Applicant pleaded guilty to the offence. 

3The Applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months and 15 days' imprisonment commencing 23 June 2011, with a remainder of term of 13 months and 15 days, bringing the head sentence to 4 years and 6 months (ending 22 December 2015). There is no standard non-parole period. 

4If leave to appeal were granted, the Applicant agitates the appeal on the following grounds:

(1)The sentencing judge erred in her application of Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; 106 A Crim R 149;

(2)The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.

The application for leave to appeal and the appeal were heard simultaneously. 

The offence

5The Applicant was sentenced on 3 May 2012, having entered a plea of guilty, for one offence of robbery in company. The circumstances of the offence were, for the purposes of the sentence, agreed. Unsurprisingly, there is no challenge to any of those facts on appeal. 

6On the evening of 23 June 2011, the victim, a 15-year-old male student, was on a train travelling west from Blacktown Station. Just after St Marys Station, the Applicant and co-accused, Mr Scott Trindall, approached the victim, who complied with a request by Mr Trindall for $2. The victim then complied with a request made by the Applicant to move to the downstairs section of the train for ""a chat"". He was asked for a cigarette by the Applicant and gave the Applicant four cigarettes. 

7Mr Trindall then said, ""You have got more than two dollars mate, empty out all your change"". The victim said he needed the change, to which Mr Trindall responded aggressively, ""Don't lie to me mate, you have a $50 note in there."" The victim said, ""Yeah, that's to last me a fortnight."" Mr Trindall grabbed the victim's arms and pulled them behind his back. He dragged the victim to the floor and onto his back with his hands behind his back. He put his left knee on the victim's chest. 

8The Applicant then said, ""I've got a knife on me."" The facts before the District Court stated that ""[t]he victim saw what appeared to be a black handle, similar to a knife handle, down the front of [the Applicant's] pants"". During evidence-in-chief, the Applicant denied that he had possessed a knife (Transcript 5). The contrary was not put to him in cross-examination. It was positively suggested that he had lied when he told the victim that he had a knife (Transcript 12). The sentencing judge concluded that she could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant had a knife during the robbery (ROS 2). 

9The Applicant then emptied the victim's wallet, taking a $50 note, some change, a NAB key card and a packet of cigarettes. Mr Trindall asked for the PIN and the Applicant said he was not sure of it. 

10The Applicant let the victim off at Kingswood and said he would hold the doors open so that the victim would not tell the guards what had happened. In the car park the victim spoke to some police who then drove him to Penrith where he identified the offenders.

Subjective circumstances 

11The Applicant was 26 at the time of the offence and is Aboriginal. The evidence before the Court at sentence included his criminal history, pre-sentence report of Joan Horsell dated 25 April 2012 and psychological report of Peter Champion dated 19 April 2012.

12His record contained antecedents in the Children's Court for stealing, resisting arrest, break, enter and steal and robbery in company. His convictions as an adult included numerous driving offences, common assault, possession of prohibited drugs, larceny, steal from person and break and enter with intent. 

13The reports, confirmed by his oral evidence, related that he had a truncated educational experience and commenced using drugs at a young age. The Applicant is one of eight children raised in a close family environment, although he had minimal contact with his father during his formative years. He was exposed to significant domestic violence and claims to have been sexually abused as a child. That claim was not examined during counselling.

14The Applicant had been subject to violent relationships with his step-father, who was particularly violent when drunk. Peter Champion assessed him as being of low average intelligence, with survival level literacy skills, and concluded that he was not mentally ill, nor suffering from a developmental disability. 

15The Applicant has a daughter with whom he maintains contact and he intends to reside with his sister on release. He left school in year 7 at the age of 13 and has had minimal employment. 

16The sentencing judge afforded him a 25 per cent discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. She concluded that the prospects of rehabilitation were ""extremely guarded"" and that the likelihood of his reoffending was ""high"". She found that the offence was spontaneous rather than planned and that the victim was ""particularly vulnerable"", which findings relate more to the circumstances of the offence rather than the offender. Nevertheless, it is convenient to reiterate them at this juncture. 

17The Applicant had a long-standing substance abuse problem, having commenced cannabis use at 15 years of age and heroin and amphetamines at 18. He has twice attempted residential rehabilitation, without success. 

18At the time of the offence, he was daily using cannabis, heroin and amphetamines. Since his incarceration, he has been on a methadone programme. Yet the Applicant does not want to participate in community based rehabilitation, but would like similar programme opportunities in prison. He has failed a previously-prescribed methadone programme in the community. The Applicant acknowledges his long-term dysfunctional behaviour. 

Ground 1: Misapplication of the Henry guidelines

19The Court (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL, Newman, Hulme and Simpson JJ) in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 was dealing with the offence of armed robbery and, on application, issued a guideline judgment, setting a guide for what was considered to be a sufficiently common set of circumstances. Those circumstances were: a young offender with no or little criminal history; the use of a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; a limited degree of planning; limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat of it; a victim in a vulnerable position, such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; a small amount of money (or goods) taken; and a plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. The Court set a range for such a sentence, because, it noted, other characteristics would be relevant and each of the characteristics is inherently variable.

20The Court set a range for the head sentence for the above offence and offender, being a sentence that generally should fall within four and five years' imprisonment. In Henry, the Court once more emphasised that a guideline judgment does not lay down a rule or prescription. The failure to adhere to the guideline is not itself a ground of appeal: Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17; (1986) 161 CLR 513, per Brennan J; Henry at [13]-[31], especially at [29]-[30], and the cases cited therein.

21Because the Henry guideline is to be treated in that way, it may sometimes be used as a useful guidepost for offences not strictly caught by the common characteristics that were used to formulate the guideline. In that way, this Court expressed the view that the Henry judgment could be used as a guide for sentencing an offender for robbery in company: Murchie v R [1999] NSWCCA 424; (1999) 108 A Crim R 482. As the Court said in Murchie:

""[20] The legislature has prescribed the same maximum penalty for robbery in company as it has prescribed for armed robbery. I consider that the guideline promulgated by this Court in relation to armed robbery offences is equally applicable to offences of robbery in company which can be seen as broadly equivalent. I would therefore proceed on the basis that the sentence promulgated in Henry in relation to offences of armed robbery provides equally a guideline in relation to offences of robbery in company. Of course, as was stressed in Henry and Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209; 101 A Crim R 259, a guideline sentence is precisely that and is not to be applied inflexibly."" (Per Simpson J.)

22The Applicant, under this ground of appeal, submits that the guideline has been misapplied and the degree of seriousness of the offence overstated. While not expressly put in these terms, the Applicant submits that there has been double counting of the factor associated with the robbery having been carried out in company: first, by using robbery in company as the qualifying factor for use of the guideline; and, secondly, by using the fact that there were two assailants as an aggravating factor (although not described in that way) in assessing the seriousness of the offence. 

23As earlier stated, a guideline judgment is intended to be a guide only. It is not to be used as a template or prescription from which sentencing judges subtract or to which they add with mathematical precision.

24The submissions of the Applicant and of the Crown take an overly precise or mathematical approach. The only permitted ""mathematical"" aspect is that, given the sentencing judge's reduction of the sentence by 25 per cent to account for a plea at the earliest possible time, a comparison which the guideline judgment should allow for a comparison of like with like.

25The starting point for the sentence imposed on the Applicant is 6 years' imprisonment (i.e. the head sentence before allowing for a 25 per cent discount to arrive at 4 years and 6 months' imprisonment). Utilising a similar arithmetic approach, the Crown calculates that the upper most starting point for a head sentence under the guideline is 5 years and 7 months' imprisonment, allowing for a 10 per cent discount for a late plea: see R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [30]. (Indeed, if more than 10 per cent discount were to be accommodated, the starting point in the guideline would need to be higher.)

26The Applicant's submission then relies on the proposition that the mid-point of the Henry range is 4 years and 6 months and, therefore, the:

""[s]tarting point, prior to a 10 per cent discount, would be 5 years. Therefore, the mid point of the range, where a 25 per cent discount is applicable, is 3 years and 9 months"".

In drawing a criticism of her Honour from the foregoing, the Applicant is confusing an arithmetic mid-point in a guideline judgment with the mid-range of offending.

27As her Honour correctly noted, the maximum sentence for the offence is 20 years' imprisonment. The guideline judgment is intended to be a range for a particular kind of offence of armed robbery and a particular kind of offender. It is not intended to set a range for a ""mid-range offence"", but for the kind of offence described by the Court as sufficiently common.

28Other than the issue raised as ""double counting"", no attempt has been made to criticise the sentencing judge's categorisation of the offence as ""above the range envisaged by the guideline judgment"". It is necessary, therefore, to deal with the comparison within the range, otherwise than arithmetically, including the issue of whether there has been ""double counting"".

29First, it is necessary to reiterate that the Applicant was 26 years of age at the time of the offence. He is, and was at the time, no longer a ""young offender"", for whom significantly different principles apply: see Tammer-Spence v R [2013] NSWCCA 297 at [36]-[37] and the authorities cited therein, particularly BP v R [2010] NSWCCA 159; (2010) 201 A Crim R 379 at [4] per Hodgson JA.

30As a consequence, one of the fundamental criteria for the application of the guideline judgment disappears and a significant reason for leniency has been eliminated.

31Secondly, the vulnerability of the victim as a factor is exacerbated, because, not only was he young (15 years of age), he was travelling on public transport, with no means of escape, he was detained (i.e. required to follow the offender) and was, in the knowledge of the offender, deprived of his means of livelihood for the next two week period.

32I deal next with the alleged ""double counting"". One of the reasons for equating robbery in company with armed robbery is the identicality of the maximum sentence for each offence. Another reason is that each aggravated offence has a particularly problematic effect on the victim, inducing fear and often resulting in lasting trauma.

33Where, as here, the robbery in company is accompanied by the threat of a weapon (even though an empty threat), the seriousness of the effect of the offence on the victim is exacerbated. In my view, it is for that reason that her Honour listed the factors at ROS 8-9 about which the Applicant complains on appeal. It is appropriate to reiterate her Honour's comments:

""The offence is one which falls above the range envisaged by the guideline judgment taking into account the circumstances of the offence which involved actual violence in addition to the threat of the use of a knife which as I found was non existent. But a threat nonetheless to heighten the victim's fears and to make him comply with the offender's demands, the presence of two offenders, a vulnerable victim only fifteen years of age at the time, the small sum taken and a threat was made not to inform the authorities and the offence was committed by someone in company who has significant prior criminal antecedents.

It does however appear to have been an offence which was opportunistic or spontaneous rather than something which was planned. It was committed in circumstances wherein the offenders were highly likely to be caught.

In mitigation the offender entered his plea at the earliest opportunity and I allow him a twenty-five per cent discount. I find he is remorseful and contrite and does show insight into the impact his offender behaviour would have had upon his victim.""

34On one view, the possession of a knife, which is neither used nor the existence of which is known to the victim, has less impact on a victim than it might in a situation where, as here, the victim is told of a knife and sees what looks like a knife handle, but no knife is actually possessed.

35Her Honour was sentencing an adult for an offence that carried a maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment, in circumstances where there was the threat that a knife would be used and significant disempowering conduct. The reason her Honour re-stated, in the cited passage, both the company and the threat of the knife was to emphasise the effect on the victim and not to utilise as an aggravating factor that which gave rise (or was essential) to the offence in question, or was itself an element of the offence: see s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.

36The Applicant's first ground of appeal is not made out.

Ground 2: Manifest Excess

37The Applicant once more relies on the fact that the sentence imposed was above the Henry guideline. Of itself, that is not a basis for the establishment of manifest excess.

38In dealing with the first ground of appeal, I have noted that there were good reasons for a sentence above the Henry guideline, particularly that the offender was no longer young, in the sense relevant to criminal culpability.

39The Applicant relies on an analysis of statistical material and on ""comparable"" verdicts. Statistics may sometimes be a useful tool, but are always a poor master: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520.

40Even so the statistics establish a range which puts the sentence imposed on the Applicant in the top 23 per cent of sentences for robbery in company. The difficulty is that most offences of this kind are committed by young offenders, under 21 years of age, for whom different outcomes would be expected because of the different approach: see above.

41On the other hand, armed robbery cannot be described in the same manner and the statistics apply to both offences, but not to the aggravated offence of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon.

42The fundamental difficulty with the use of statistics is that those statistics become a self-fulfilling range and become a de facto guidepost in place of the maximum sentence and, where relevant, the standard non-parole period. It is necessary to be very careful in the manner in which such statistics are used.

43The Applicant also relies on a number of comparable situations. In each case, the sentence was imposed on a young offender, the eldest of whom was 21 years of age.

44As already stated, young offenders are not generally appropriate for comparison purposes. Interestingly, an analysis of those cases in which a head sentence of 4 years and 6 months was imposed, upon which the Applicant relies in the Judicial Commission statistics, shows a marked similarity with the Applicant and, of the 90 offenders in that category, 65 of them are over 25 years of age.

45More importantly, many of the circumstances of the offences for which a head sentence of 4 years and 6 months has been set are comparable with the Applicant's circumstances, including a discount for an early plea of guilty.

46Ultimately, sentencing is an intuitive process for which there is no single correct answer. The sentence imposed is ""within range"" and was not manifestly excessive. I do not consider that any lesser sentence is warranted. Even if I were of another view and would have fixed a lower sentence, such a view, if formed, is not the test for manifest excess. This sentence was available as an exercise of her Honour's discretion for this offence and offender. This ground also fails.

Conclusion

47Each of the grounds of appeal, in my view, fails. As a consequence, I would propose that the Court make the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted;

(2)Appeal dismissed.

48DAVIES J: I agree with Rothman J.

1The Plaintiff moves by Motion filed on 19 November 2013 seeking leave to amend the summons to seek an order pursuant to s 27 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 and seeking pursuant to rule 13.1 UCPR that summary judgment be given for the Plaintiff on its claim for an order pursuant to s 27 of that Act. 
2Section 27 (2) provides that the Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was at any time not more than six years before the making of the application for the order engaged in a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity or a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for five years or more. 
3The Defendant was convicted on 27 July 2012 of supplying 2.228 kilograms of cannabis contrary to s 25 (1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.  Under s 6(2)(b) of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act that is a serious crime related activity. 
4The Defendant appears this morning and asks for an adjournment of the motion.  He said that he thought that what was going to be sought by the Plaintiff was an examination on oath by him and I took him to say that he was agreeable to that. 
5This matter first came before me on Monday of this week.  There was no appearance for the Defendant but a friend of his asked to be heard to indicate that the Defendant was ill and provided a medical certificate which expired yesterday.  It was in those circumstances that I indicated I would adjourn the matter on Monday to today but that the matter would be heard today. 
6The Defendant appears to have done nothing since he was served on 25 November with this notice of motion.  At the present time he is formally represented by Rodney Van Houten who filed a notice of appearance on his behalf on 5 September 2011.  Mr Dykyj tells me that Mr Van Houten is not in fact acting for him at the moment and I have been informed by the Plaintiff that a Notice of Intention to File a Notice Ceasing to Act has in fact been filed by Mr Van Houten after service of the present motion upon him. 
7It does not seem to me that there is any basis for adjourning the motion.  The Defendant has had sufficient opportunity to engage legal assistance if he wished to do so to defend the motion.  However, the terms of s 27(2) would appear to indicate that there would be little defence that the Defendant would be able to offer in all of the circumstances. 
8For that reason I decline to adjourn the Motion.  I am satisfied in terms of s 27(2) that a proceeds assessment order should be made.  Leave is given to the Plaintiff to amend the Summons in the form which I will initial and date today and place on the file. 
9I make orders in terms of paragraphs 2 and 3 of a draft order provided to me.  I order that the Defendant pay the costs of the present application.  I grant leave to the Defendant pursuant to s 25 and s 26 of the Act to make application for exclusion orders on or before Thursday, 12 December 2013.  These orders may be entered forthwith.

2705728,Mitchell v R; Mitchell v R [2013] NSWCCA 318,"Judgment

1WARD JA: I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J and with the orders proposed.

2HARRISON J: I also agree.

3R A HULME J: Michael Robert Mitchell and Paul Christopher Mitchell (""the applicants"") apply for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon them by his Honour Judge Robison in the District Court at Moree on 27 March 2013.

4For an offence of break and enter with intent to steal in circumstances of aggravation, namely that they were in company of each other and another person, the applicants were each sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months. The sentences were specified to date from 12 September 2012. The non-parole periods expired yesterday.

5The offence is contrary to s 113(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 14 years. 

6Taken into account at each applicant's request were two further offences listed on a Form 1 document: larceny and being carried in a conveyance taken without the consent of the owner.

Facts

7Michael Mitchell was aged 19 at the time of the offences and Paul Mitchell was aged 22. Together with their brother Alan, aged 40, they set out on a journey from Tumut to Queensland, ostensibly for Alan to seek employment opportunities. 

8On 11 September 2012, on the Newell Highway near Gilgandra they stopped at the access road to a rural property where a work vehicle was parked. Together they stole a tool box from the rear of the vehicle. It contained two chainsaws and various other tools and implements, altogether worth about $1250. I interpolate that these items were ultimately recovered. This constituted the offence of larceny that was taken into account.

9The offenders continued their journey north and when about 40km south of Narrabri their vehicle broke down. They eventually managed to get a lift into Narrabri. At some point that night they were walking past the premises of an audio-electronics business. They noticed a Toyota Landcruiser parked in the yard. They entered the yard where Alan Mitchell broke into and started this vehicle. The applicants got in and the trio proceeded back to where their car had broken down. The car was towed back into Narrabri and the stolen car was dumped on the outskirts of the town. The applicants being passengers in the stolen car constituted the other offence that was taken into account.

10The offenders then decided to return to the audio-electronics business in order to break in and steal tools and music equipment. They entered through a hole in the fence earlier made by Paul Mitchell. They forced open a garage door. Michael and Paul Mitchell entered the building with the intention of stealing but an alarm was activated and all three fled the scene.

11The three offenders were arrested on the morning of 12 September 2012. They were taken to the Narrabri police station where it is said that they were co-operative with investigators and made full admissions. 

12Compensation was sought by the prosecution for the damage occasioned to the stolen car. Payment was proffered by way of a solicitor's trust account cheque at the sentence hearing.

13In assessing the seriousness of the primary offence (the aggravated break and enter with intent) the judge noted that there was ""no real degree of planning"" and that it was ""somewhat spontaneous"". His Honour posed for himself the question ""whose idea was it"" and answered it by saying that, because of his age, Alan Mitchell had to take ""considerable responsibility"".

14The judge concluded that the objective seriousness of the primary offence was ""within the lower end of the range"". This had been conceded by the solicitor appearing for the Crown.

Personal circumstances of the applicants

15There was very little material placed before the judge concerning the personal circumstances of the applicants. They did not give evidence and there were no reports.

16The judge noted that Michael Mitchell was aged 20 (at the time of sentence); was single and had no dependents; and was an itinerant tree surgeon.

17He had a criminal history consisting of a number of matters dealt with in the Tumut Children's Court between 2005 and 2010, all of which were resolved by way of bonds, probation or fines. There was one matter dealt with in the Tumut Local Court in March 2012 which resulted in a fine. He had not previously been held in custody.

18Paul Mitchell was aged 22; single with no dependents; and was also an itinerant worker.

19His criminal history was similar to that of his younger brother. There were matters dealt with in the Tumut Children's Court between 2003 and 2008 and subsequent matters in the Local Court. All of these matters were dealt with by way of fines and bonds. He, too, had not previously been held in custody.

The assessment of sentence

20The judge noted that the applicants were ""very young men""; ""each have a track record in the criminal justice system"" but they had ""their whole lives ahead of them"" and that ""rehabilitation [was] in their hands"". 

21His Honour was satisfied that imprisonment was appropriate: s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). He found, pursuant to s 44(2), that there were special circumstances warranting a reduction of the proportion of the sentence to be represented by the non-parole period. His Honour reasoned that a ""prolonged period on parole would provide a better opportunity for eventual reintegration into society in the hope that their long term futures can be addressed by appropriate forms of counselling and rehabilitation under supervision"". 

22The judge adverted to the need to take into account the additional offences on the Form 1 documents, noting that he ""should not pay mere lip service"" to them. He also adverted to the principle of parity, given that he was sentencing three offenders. Regard was also had to sentencing statistics with which he had been provided. 

23The applicants had pleaded guilty at an early stage and for the utilitarian benefit of their pleas the judge reduced their sentences by 25 per cent.

Grounds of appeal

1. The sentence imposed started from a notional staring point that was too high.

2. His Honour failed to consider that no punishment was appropriate other than sentence of imprisonment: s 5 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

3. His Honour failed to consider the 3 stage process per: Douar [2005] NSWCCA 455 at paras [69] to [72] which should be activated once the court determines that a full-time custodial sentence needs to be imposed.

4. The sentence imposed on the applicant was manifestly excessive.

Consideration

24Ground 1 is unnecessary to determine because the starting point for the sentences is relevant to the determination of Ground 4.

25Grounds 2 and 3 have no merit. As the submissions for the Crown in this Court point out, the judge was not invited to consider something other than full-time imprisonment. 

26In relation to Ground 4 it is pertinent to note that the starting points for the sentences before the 25 per cent reduction for the pleas of guilty was 3 years. 

27The sentencing statistics compiled by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales have well-known limitations in their utility in assessing appropriate sentences: see, for example, Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; (2010) 242 CLR 520 at [48] and [55]. With that in mind, I note that the statistics for sentencing for offences against s 113(2) of the Crimes Act, in their current iteration, show that in the 210 cases comprising the database, full-time imprisonment was imposed on 143 occasions. One hundred and thirty eight of those 143 cases involved pleas of guilty. Eighty per cent of those cases involved sentences ranging from more than 12 months up to 4 years with a median of 3 years. For offenders aged 21 to 25, the range is not dissimilar and the median is the same. For offenders aged 18 to 20 the range is, again, not dissimilar but the median is 2 years.

28It is of some significance that about a third of cases did not result in a full-time custodial sentence. 

29I acknowledge the point made by the Crown that the range is not that determined by sentencing statistics but by the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence by Parliament, in this case 14 years imprisonment.

30It was the Crown's contention that the sentences, whilst ""stern"", were within the broad range of discretion of the primary judge and that they should not be regarded as ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"" and thus manifestly excessive: Dinsdale v R [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325.

Determination

31For offences found to be ""at the lower end of the range"" of objective seriousness, committed by 19 and 22 year old men who had not previously experienced a custodial sentence, sentences of 2 years 3 months, reduced from 3 years on account of the pleas of guilty, are manifestly excessive. The sentencing statistics are by no means determinative but they provide broad support for that conclusion.

32In my view, the appropriate starting point should have been 1 year. Reducing that by 25 per cent would yield a term of 9 months. The finding of special circumstances made by the primary judge should be maintained. 

33It should be noted that both applicants were subsequently sentenced in the District Court at Wagga Wagga on 8 August 2013 for a variety of similar offences to substantial terms of imprisonment. Whatever the outcome of the present proceedings, they will each remain in custody serving those sentences. They were specified to take effect from 12 January 2013. Michael Mitchell will not become eligible for parole until 11 June 2016 and Paul Mitchell will not become eligible for parole until 11 October 2016.

34Those sentences are irrelevant to the disposition of the present application. The Court was informed that an appeal is contemplated.

Proposed orders

35I propose the following orders in each case:

1 Leave to appeal granted.

2 Appeal allowed.

3 Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 27 March 2013.

4 In lieu, each offender sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 6 months with a balance of the term of the sentence of 3 months. The sentences are to date from 12 September 2012. Direct release on parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 11 March 2013. The total term of the sentence expired on 11 June 2013.

2705733,Loh v R [2013] NSWCCA 339,"Judgment

1WARD JA: I agree with the reasons of R A Hulme J and the orders he proposes.

2HARRISON J: I also agree.

3R A HULME J: Lawrence Yong Loh (""the applicant"") applies for leave to appeal against a 14 year sentence imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Bennett SC in the District Court at Sydney on 28 October 2010. The applicant had pleaded guilty to an offence of supplying heroin in excess of a large commercial quantity. That is an offence contrary to s 25(2) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW) and the maximum penalty prescribed is imprisonment for life and/or a fine of 5000 penalty units. In sentencing him for that offence, the judge took into account at the applicant's request a further offence listed on a Form 1 document of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime, namely $7000.

4The grounds of appeal are that the judge had erroneous regard to the prescription of a standard non-parole period and that the sentence was manifestly excessive because of a lesser sentence imposed upon a co-offender. 

Facts

5There was no dispute about the summary of the facts contained in the sentencing judgment. I draw the following from that source.

6On 16 January 2009, the applicant and a man named Chuan Tat Kho were under physical surveillance as they left a rented room in Chatswood and made their way to a café in the city. At the café the applicant sat at a table on the footpath whilst Kho went inside and made a purchase. Another co-offender, Chin Lai Tan came to the café and joined the applicant at the table. Tan had a trolley case with him which he placed on the ground beside him. Kho joined the other two at the table. After about ten minutes, the three stood up and Kho took the case and wheeled it towards George Street followed by Tan and the applicant. Kho hailed a taxi whilst the applicant and Tan appeared to converse. A taxi stopped and Kho lifted the case into the boot and then he and the applicant entered the taxi while Tan walked away. 

7Police stopped the taxi a short time later and arrested the applicant and Kho. Tan was not arrested at that point but was apprehended at Sydney Airport the following day as he was about to leave Australia.

8The trolley case was secured with a combination lock, the number for which was given to the police by the applicant. The applicant gave evidence of having been provided with the combination by Tan at the time the case was delivered to him. Inside the case was 13.999 kilograms of white powder which was found to contain heroin at a purity of 70 per cent. The large commercial quantity for heroin is one kilogram.

9There was evidence before the judge that when broken down into ultimate street deals, the drug had an estimated value in the range of $14,500,000 to $20,300,000.

10When police executed a search warrant at the apartment where the applicant was living they found paraphernalia consistent with the repackaging of heroin. This consisted of clip seal bags and latex gloves. The applicant's evidence was that he had purchased these items as he was told that the drugs were already contained in bags which might break and need to be repackaged. 

11The applicant's evidence was that he came to Australia from Singapore to assist in this crime. He said that he intended to pass on the trolley bag knowing that it contained drugs which he knew was heroin. He was to make $30,000 in cash and an additional $10,000 was provided to him for expenses. He said that before coming to Australia he was suffering stress because he was in debt in the sum of $150,000 which he had borrowed to assist his brother and family with medical treatment. He was desperate to get money to repay that loan. He said that he was retained to take delivery of the drugs from Tan and then to pass them on to other people in accordance with instructions to be received by telephone.

12Between 1 and 16 January 2009, when the applicant was arrested, there were 43 recorded telephone connections between the phones used by Tan and the applicant. 

Personal features of the offender

13The judge noted that the applicant was married and had three children aged ten and under. He had not seen them since his arrest, which caused him some distress. 

14A psychiatric report by Dr Richard Furst included an assessment that the applicant was suffering a major depressive disorder as a result of the stress suffered in Singapore because of the debt and the consequences of his participation in the index offence. The judge noted that the depressive disorder was a product primarily of the applicant's legal difficulties, financial problems and separation from his family. 

15The judge took into account that the applicant had used his time in custody to good advantage in terms of undertaking employment and courses. 

16There was an issue about assistance to authorities which culminated in the judge determining that no discount should be allowed but it would be a factor regarded as relevant to the applicant's contrition. The judge was satisfied that the applicant was remorseful. 

17The judge found in the applicant's favour that he was of good character, he had no prior convictions, he had good prospects of rehabilitation and his risk of further offending was low.

18The judge also took into account that being in custody in this country and thereby separated from his family would involve additional hardship for the applicant in custody.

19A finding of special circumstances was made which warranted a ""modest"" reduction in the non-parole period that would otherwise have been imposed.

20The applicant had pleaded guilty on the first day of his trial and it was common ground that a reduction of sentence of 12.5 per cent was appropriate to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea.

Role of the applicant and other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence

21The judge took into account that the offence was part of organised criminal activity and the applicant's goal was financial gain. His Honour also had regard to the significant harm that could have been caused in the community if the drugs had have been further disseminated. 

22The judge regarded the three offenders as being participants as ""individual cells in an overall enterprise being directed by others at a higher level"". He regarded Kho, Tan and the applicant as being at a level below the criminals managing the enterprise and directing it. He added, however, ""they were critical components in the distribution of almost 14 kilograms of heroin at 70 per cent purity. But for their willingness to participate, this crime could not have been committed"". 

23A final observation made by the judge before imposing sentence was the need to reflect in the assessment of sentence general deterrence, denunciation of the applicant's conduct, and recognition of the harm that could have fallen upon the community. 

Ground 1: That the Court erred in law by reason of its erroneous application of Div 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) by inappropriately asking whether there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period and then proceeding to assess whether the offence was within the mid range of objective seriousness and thereby treating the standard minimum non-parole period as having determinative significance to the applicant's sentence.

24The judge sentenced by reference to the principles enunciated by this court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. Although judgment was given shortly after the High Court of Australia handed down its decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, the judge made no reference to it. It was contended by counsel for the applicant that the judge's approach was erroneous in that he adopted a two-stage approach to sentence held to be erroneous in Muldrock. It was further contended that the judge accorded the standard non-parole period determinative significance. 

25By way of response the Crown contended that a fair reading of the remarks on sentence in their entirety did not disclose the errors for which the applicant contended.

26Upon my reading of the sentencing remarks, it appears that in some passages the judge did allude to a mode of reasoning impugned in Muldrock whereas in other parts he appears to have adopted an approach in accordance with that identified as being correct in that decision. It is unnecessary to set out the various passages from the sentencing remarks as I am persuaded that the applicant should be given the benefit of the doubt with a finding that the judge probably did err as contended. That, of course, is not the end of the matter because it enlivens the consideration of whether a less severe sentence was warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 

Ground 2: That the applicant's sentence is manifestly excessive because the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the sentence imposed upon him compared to that of the co-offender Chuan Fat Kho.

27The co-offender Kho was sentence by his Honour Judge Berman SC in the District Court on 14 September 2012. The delay in sentencing him as compared to the sentencing of Tan and the applicant is explained by the fact that Kho was found guilty by a jury in 2010 but successfully appealed against his conviction to this court. He was retried before Judge Berman and again found guilty. Kho was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. 

28Bennett DCJ sentenced Tan prior to sentencing the applicant. He imposed a sentence of 15 years 3 months 28 days with a non-parole period of 10 years. That sentence was imposed after trial. 

29The submissions on behalf of the applicant contend that the subjective circumstances of both the applicant and Kho were ""virtually identical"". It was submitted that despite the finding by Berman DCJ that Kho's objective level of criminality was less than the applicant's, it was nevertheless criminality of significant seriousness having regard to the quantity of drugs involved. It was also contended that, unlike the applicant, Kho did not demonstrate contrition nor assist authorities. On the other hand the applicant had pleaded guilty, he was remorseful and had provided assistance. That led to the submission that the applicant had a justifiable sense of grievance arising from the heavier punishment imposed upon him compared to that of Kho.

Sentencing of Tan

30Tan was allowed a discount of 15 per cent for his assistance to authorities. That would mean that the starting point for his sentence would have been about 18 years. Bennett DCJ found that Tan was aware of the transaction upon which he was engaged but that his role was limited to the delivery of the trolley case to the other two offenders. He had not come to Australia in order to commit crime but was in Sydney on a holiday visa intending to extend his stay as a student and to obtain employment to improve his circumstances and provide better for his wife and children in his home country. 

31Tan claimed that on the morning of the offence he woke in response to a telephone conversation with a man he knew and as a result, met up with that man and accepted an offer of $3000 to deliver the trolley case. He knew it contained drugs. His explanation for his participation was economic need against his background of modest circumstances with obligations for the care of his wife, children and aging parents.

32Bennett DCJ was doubtful as to Tan's explanation given the telephone contact between Tan and the applicant in the fortnight or so prior to the transaction. His Honour did not accept that Tan's reward was limited to the $3000 he claimed. Despite Tan's attempt to minimise his role, the judge still accepted that his expressions of remorse were genuine.

33Tan was 22 years of age with no prior criminal record and no family in Australia. Regard was had to the fact that Tan would be imprisoned in circumstances where he would have little or no contact with his wife or children for a considerable period of time. He was found to be a person of good character with no prior convictions, good prospects of rehabilitation and a low risk of re-offending. Having regard to various circumstances the judge was satisfied that imprisonment would be a greater punishment for Tan than for a more typical inmate.

Sentencing of Kho

34The evidence before Berman DCJ was that Kho and the applicant had travelled from Chatswood to the café in the city on the morning of 16 January 2009. Tan arrived with the suitcase and sat at a table and spoke with the applicant. CCTV footage indicated that Kho appeared to be ""relatively uninterested in the conversation which was occurring"". After the offenders had consumed a drink they stood up and it was at this point that Kho took the suitcase, hailed a taxi, and put the suitcase in the boot.

35Berman DCJ noted that there was telephone contact between the applicant and Tan in the days leading up to the meeting but no known contact involving Kho.

36There was an issue as to precisely when Kho learnt that there was to be a supply of drugs on 16 January. The judge was not prepared to accept on the balance of probabilities that he only became aware immediately before the transaction took place. Similarly he was not prepared to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware of the proposed transaction at the time he came to Australia. In the end his Honour concluded that Kho became aware of the transaction ""some indeterminate time before 16 January"".

37Berman DCJ noted that it was ""notorious that those high up in the drug supply hierarchy try to avoid physical possession of drugs, preferring foot soldiers to take the risks associated with moving drugs from one place to another"". He concluded:

For those reasons I will sentence Mr Kho on the basis that he was less involved in this matter than Loh and Tan and lower down the drug supply hierarchy than those two men"".

38Kho was 38 years of age at the time of sentence and had no prior convictions. He was found to be a hard and industrious worker in Singapore and had assumed many responsibilities involving his family. It was accepted that he came to Australia for a holiday. 

39The judge had regard to Kho's industriousness whilst in custody; he was studying and had completed various courses and was planning for his release. The judge also took into account that serving a sentence in a foreign country involved a level of hardship. This included that Kho had, through his actions, deprived his parents of the assistance that he use to provide for them. 

40Finally his Honour referred to the principle of parity and had regard to the sentences imposed by Bennett DCJ on the applicant and Tan.

Determination

41Although the ground is expressed ambiguously in asserting both manifest excess and a complaint about parity, it was clarified that the ground should be confined to the latter. That is in accordance with authority to the effect that parity is an issue to be considered once one accepts that the sentence imposed was otherwise appropriate: England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [251]; McMullen v R [2013] NSWCCA 261 at [49].

42To compare the sentences imposed upon each co-offender in order to consider whether there is a legitimate sense of grievance in relation to the applicant's sentence, it is appropriate to have regard to the starting points adopted before any quantified reduction for a plea of guilty or assistance. 

43The starting point for the applicant's sentence was 16 years, whereas for Tan it was 18 years and for Kho it was 12 years.

44On any view, the level of involvement of Tan and the applicant was broadly equivalent whereas the involvement of Kho was significantly less. That on its own justified some similarity in the sentences imposed upon the applicant and Tan and a lesser sentence imposed upon Kho. 

45The applicant had a number of more favourable features to be taken into account and for that reason the distinction between the starting points for his sentence and that of Tan is understandable.

46The 12 year sentence, not subject to any reduction, imposed upon Kho was an appropriate distinction between he and the applicant. Their respective subjective circumstances were not dissimilar. In my view there is no legitimacy to the parity complaint now raised by the applicant.

Conclusion

47Having regard to the substantial gravity of the offence to which the applicant had pleaded guilty, involving as it did the supply of 14 times the large commercial quantity of heroin, I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted and should have been passed.

Proposed orders

48I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted

2. Appeal dismissed.

	JOHNSON J: The Accused, Lian Bin (Robert) Xie, is charged with five counts of murder. His trial is fixed to commence before a jury on 17 March 2014.
	
	
	On 18 November 2013, a pretrial hearing commenced before me which was intended to achieve a number of purposes. These purposes included:
	



	
	a Basha Inquiry (R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337) involving the evidence of Witness A;
	
	
	adducing evidence bearing upon parts of the Accused’s Notice of Motion filed 18 November 2013, seeking to exclude certain evidence;
	
	
	a Basha Inquiry concerning Daniel Sheen.
	



	
	The present judgment arises in the context of the Basha Inquiry with respect to Mr Sheen.
	
	
	Mr Sheen had been the solicitor for the Accused in the past. The Crown sought to adduce evidence from Mr Sheen which gave rise to a claim of client legal privilege by the Accused, and a submission by the Crown that client legal privilege had been relevantly waived.
	
	
	Having heard submissions on this issue on 25 November 2013, I ruled that client legal privilege had been waived in the area relevant to the proposed questioning by the Crown. I stated that I would publish my reasons for that ruling at a later time (PT400). In light of that ruling, evidence was then taken from Mr Sheen on the Basha Inquiry. 
	
	
	This judgment contains my reasons for ruling that client legal privilege had been waived.
	


Factual Background


	
	The Accused is charged that, on or about 18 July 2009 at North Epping, he did murder Min (Norman) Lin, Yun Li (Lily) Lin, Yun Bin (Irene) Lin, Henry Lin and Terry Lin.
	
	
	The Accused is married to Kathy Lin.
	
	
	In May 2010, Mr Sheen was acting as the solicitor for the Accused and Kathy Lin. The Accused had not been charged with the alleged offences of murder at that time.
	
	
	On 3 and 6 May 2010, Mr Sheen accompanied Kathy Lin to, and represented her at, private hearings before the New South Wales Crime Commission (“the Commission”) (Exhibit PTN, Tabs 1 and 2). Those hearings were held in camera. It is an offence to disclose anything said at a private hearing under s.13 New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985. That Act applied to the 2010 private hearings, although it has since been repealed and replaced by the Crime Commission Act 2012.
	
	
	During the course of the private hearing on 6 May 2010, Kathy Lin was examined by Counsel Assisting the Commission concerning the type, brand and size of shoes which the Accused ordinarily wore. That evidence was subject to the confidentiality provisions referred to above.
	
	
	After the Accused was charged with the murders, committal proceedings took place before a Magistrate in connection with those charges. On 21 August 2012, Kathy Lin was called as a witness by the Crown. Mr Corish, of counsel, appeared for Kathy Lin on that occasion. Mr Turnbull SC appeared for the Accused. Mr Tedeschi QC, Senior Crown Prosecutor, appeared for the Crown at those proceedings.
	
	
	It was the case that an audio-visual surveillance device had been placed by investigators in the home of the Accused and Kathy Lin at 4 Beck Street, North Epping prior to 6 May 2010. That surveillance device captured certain images, which the Crown says depict the Accused cutting up shoe boxes and disposing of them in the early hours of 7 May 2010 (Exhibits PTO and PTP).
	
	
	At the committal proceedings on 21 August 2012, the Senior Crown Prosecutor asked questions of Kathy Lin concerning what she had been asked at the private hearing on 6 May 2010 concerning her husband’s shoes, and whether the Accused had destroyed shoe boxes in her presence in the early hours of 7 May 2010. The surveillance device footage was played to Kathy Lin during her evidence.
	
	
	It is fair to say that Kathy Lin’s responses to the Crown involved uncertainty as to her recollection, followed by an indication that the images in question were not clear (see, for example, Exhibit PTN, Tab 3, pages 31, 34-35, 41-42, 45-48, 53-54, 56-57).
	
	
	Under cross-examination by Mr Turnbull SC, Kathy Lin was asked about questioning by Counsel Assisting the Commission on 6 May 2010 (Exhibit PTN, Tab 4, T229.24):
	


“Q. I understand that but what about the detail, do you remember being told on that day by Mr O'Connor [Counsel Assisting] that investigations showed that the size of the shoes, the Asics sneaker that was apparently identified as being left by the killer or killers, was the same size as your husband?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Do you remember being told that?

A. WITNESS: Yes.”


	
	Mr Turnbull SC continued to cross-examine Kathy Lin (Exhibit PTN, Tab 4, T230-231):
	


“Q. Did you, when you answered those questions and the question that followed, did you think that the Crime Commission were suggesting somebody to you?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Who were they suggesting to you?

A. WITNESS: My husband.

Q. You didn't accept that he had done anything wrong when you were asked those questions did you?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. You know as far as you are concerned for a fact that he is not the killer, isn't that right?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. After you left there you went home, isn't that right, to Beck Street?

A. WITNESS: We went to solicitor office.

Q. At the solicitor's office was it just you and the solicitor?

A. WlTNESS: And then my husband.

Q. Back at the solicitor's office was there any discussion about what had occurred at the Crime Commission?

A. WITNESS: The solicitor say my husband's suspect.

Q. The solicitor said that?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Who was present when he said that?

A. WITNESS: Me and my husband.

Q. Was there any mention of the propositions that had been put to you in those questions that I have just read out?

A. WITNESS: Only say the shoes is similar as my husband wear, the Asics.

Q. Did he put - did he say to you that the shoes, it was being asserted, being said were the same size as your husband's shoes?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Did you know whether or not it was allowed for the solicitor to speak to your husband about these things?

A. WITNESS: I don't know.

Q. Were you feeling upset and under stress at the time that you went back to the solicitor's office for this?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Did you remember any of the detail personally - the detail of what had been put to you that day about all sorts of things, the key and that kind of thing or not?

A. WITNESS: That times I'm extremely upset.

Q. What happened then after you had this conversation?

A. WITNESS: Then my husband took me home. I'm still shocking and feel upset, angry.”


	
	A little later, Mr Turnbull SC asked Kathy Lin (Exhibit PTN, Tab 4, T235):
	


“Q. You see, you've come here and you've been asked questions about a video which was shown to you by Mr Tedeschi, remember that, about activities in your house?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Remember you were asked questions about what you could see on that video?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. You were asked questions about whether or not you accepted that it was a box or looked like a box?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Remember that?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. After your solicitor told you and Robert, what you told us he told you before lunch, remember, about the proceedings that ... (not transcribable)…

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. You and Robert drove home together, isn't that right?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. You and Robert talked about what the solicitor had said to you, isn't that right?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Would it be fair to say that you and Robert together expressed to each other real fear about what the Crime Commission had said about the shoe?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. Robert used to work in a shoe factory, didn't he?

A. WITNESS: Yes.”


	
	Soon after, Mr Turnbull SC asked Kathy Lin (Exhibit PTN, Tab 4, T235-236):
	


“Q. You're aware, because you've seen the video and you've had some time to review some of the evidence before you were called back into court, that that video shows a variety of activities, potentially?

A. WITNESS: Yes.

Q. You saw Robert cutting up some boxes that night, didn't you?

A. WITNESS: Yes.”

Client Legal Privilege and Waiver


	
	In light of the evidence given by Kathy Lin during the committal proceedings, the Crown sought to ask Mr Sheen questions concerning any discussion with the Accused and Kathy Lin following the private hearing on 6 May 2010, in which the topic of shoes was discussed.
	
	
	It was common ground that, as both the Accused and Kathy Lin were clients of Mr Sheen at the time, client legal privilege would apply to any such communications by way of ss.118 and 119 Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Mr Ramage QC, for the Accused, informed the Court that the Accused did not waive any client legal privilege which existed in this respect. Mr Williams, solicitor, who appeared for Mr Sheen, informed the Court that Kathy Lin had waived privilege on this topic (PT398-399, 404).
	
	
	The issue for determination was whether the Accused had waived privilege in circumstances where his senior counsel had cross-examined Kathy Lin at committal proceedings concerning communications which had transpired during a meeting in Mr Sheen’s office on 6 May 2010, at which both the Accused and Kathy Lin were present.
	
	
	In circumstances where I am satisfied that client legal privilege existed with respect to communications between the Accused and Mr Sheen on this occasion, the Crown bears the onus of persuading the Court that client legal privilege has been lost: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 24) [2007] NSWSC 783 at [9]; Aouad v R; El-Zayet v R [2013] NSWSC 760 at [35]; Hannaford v Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, NSW [2013] NSWSC 1708 at [90].
	
	
	For this purpose, attention must be given to s.122 Evidence Act 1995 which provides:
	


“122    Loss of client legal privilege: consent and related matters

(1)    This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence given with the consent of the client or party concerned.

(2)    Subject to subsection (5), this Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence if the client or party concerned has acted in a way that is inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence because it would result in a disclosure of a kind referred to in section 118, 119 or 120.

(3)    Without limiting subsection (2), a client or party is taken to have so acted if:

(a)    the client or party knowingly and voluntarily disclosed the substance of the evidence to another person, or

(b)    the substance of the evidence has been disclosed with the express or implied consent of the client or party.

(4)    The reference in subsection (3) (a) to a knowing and voluntary disclosure does not include a reference to a disclosure by a person who was, at the time of the disclosure, an employee or agent of the client or party, or of a lawyer of the client or party, unless the employee or agent was authorised by the client, party or lawyer to make the disclosure.

(5)    A client or party is not taken to have acted in a manner inconsistent with the client or party objecting to the adducing of the evidence merely because:

(a)    the substance of the evidence has been disclosed:

(i)    in the course of making a confidential communication or preparing a confidential document, or

(ii)    as a result of duress or deception, or

(iii)    under compulsion of law, or

(iv)    if the client or party is a body established by, or a person holding an office under, an Australian law - to the Minister, or the Minister of the Commonwealth, the State or Territory, administering the law, or part of the law, under which the body is established or the office is held, or

(b)    of a disclosure by a client to another person if the disclosure concerns a matter in relation to which the same lawyer is providing, or is to provide, professional legal services to both the client and the other person, or

(c)    of a disclosure to a person with whom the client or party had, at the time of the disclosure, a common interest relating to the proceeding or an anticipated or pending proceeding in an Australian court or a foreign court.

(6)    This Division does not prevent the adducing of evidence of a document that a witness has used to try to revive the witness’s memory about a fact or opinion or has used as mentioned in section 32 (Attempts to revive memory in court) or 33 (Evidence given by police officers).”


	
	Waiver of the privilege may be express or implied: Mann v Carnell [1999] HCA 66; 201 CLR 1 at 13 [28]-[29]. Consent under s.122(1) includes consent that will be imputed to the client on the same principle where, at common law, a client will be taken to have waived privilege, even though the client did not subjectively intend to do so: Chen v City Convenience Leasing Pty Limited [2005] NSWCA 297 at [29]-[33]; R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 24) at [37].
	
	
	Common law principles concerning waiver have application in considering whether client legal privilege has been lost for the purpose of s.122. In Expense Reduction Analysts Group Pty Limited v Armstrong Strategic Management and Marketing Pty Limited [2013] HCA 46; 250 CLR 303, French CJ, Kiefel, Bell, Gageler and Keane JJ (in a joint judgment) said at 315-316 [30]-[32] (footnotes excluded):
	


“30.   According to its strict legal connotation, waiver is an intentional act done with knowledge whereby a person abandons a right (or privilege) by acting in a manner inconsistent with that right (or privilege). It may be express or implied. In most cases concerning waiver, the area of dispute is whether it is to be implied. In some cases waiver will be imputed by the law with the consequence that a privilege is lost, even though that consequence was not intended by the party losing the privilege. The courts will impute an intention where the actions of a party are plainly inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect.

31.   In Craine v Colonial Mutual Fire Insurance Co Ltd, it was explained that ‘'[w]aiver' is a doctrine of some arbitrariness introduced by the law to prevent a man in certain circumstances from taking up two inconsistent positions ... It is a conclusion of law when the necessary facts are established. It looks, however, chiefly to the conduct and position of the person who is said to have waived, in order to see whether he has 'approbated' so as to prevent him from 'reprobating'‘. In Mann v Carnell, it was said that it is considerations of fairness which inform the court's view about an inconsistency which may be seen between the conduct of a party and the maintenance of confidentiality, though ‘not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large.’

32.   Those considerations, articulated in relation to waiver at common law, apply with equal force in relation to the statutory question posed by s 122(2) of the Evidence Act, and made applicable by s 131A of that Act to the determination of a question of waiver of client legal privilege arising in the context of pre-trial discovery. That question is whether the client or party concerned ‘has acted in a way that is inconsistent with the client or party objecting to’ the production of a document.”


	
	I am satisfied that client legal privilege may be lost, as a result of questions asked in cross-examination of a witness, which disclose communications said to have been made in the course of a meeting with the person’s solicitor. In the present case, the Accused was represented by most experienced senior counsel at the committal proceedings. As it happens, Kathy Lin was separately represented by counsel at that hearing as well.
	
	
	In cross-examining Kathy Lin in this way at committal proceedings, it should be taken that senior counsel for the Accused was acting on instructions: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683-684. Questions were asked in cross-examination concerning what had been discussed at the meeting with Mr Sheen on 6 May 2010, at which both the Accused and Kathy Lin were present.
	
	
	I am satisfied that this process of questioning involved the knowing and voluntary disclosure of the substance of what would otherwise have been a privileged communication, for the purpose of s.122(3)(a) Evidence Act 1995.
	
	
	Further, the common law rationale underlying the concept of waiver, and as maintained by s.122, would mean that relevant inconsistency would arise if the Accused was able to bring about disclosure of alleged communications through cross-examination of Kathy Lin at the committal proceedings, but could maintain privilege so as to prevent Mr Sheen being asked questions about communications on the same topic which took place at that time.
	
	
	Accordingly, I was satisfied that the Crown had demonstrated that client legal privilege had been lost for the purpose of s.122 Evidence Act 1995, as a result of the process of cross-examination of Kathy Lin at committal proceedings.
	
	
	It was for these reasons that I gave a ruling in the following terms on 25 November 2013 (PT400.22):
	


“I am satisfied that client legal privilege existed in May 2010 with respect to confidential communications between Daniel Sheen, solicitor, and his then clients, Lian Bin Robert Xie and Kathy Lin.

I am satisfied that the cross examination of Kathy Lin by Senior Counsel for the accused during committal proceedings on 28 August 2012 constituted waiver of client legal privilege by the accused for the purpose of s.122 of the Evidence Act 1995 with respect to questions proposed to be asked of Mr Sheen concerning discussions at a meeting in Mr Sheen's office with the accused and Miss Lin following a New South Wales Crime Commission private hearing on 6 May 2010 with respect to the topics of shoes, or shoeboxes which had been the subject of questioning of Miss Lin before the New South Wales Crime Commission that day.”


	
	By way of postscript, I note that Mr Sheen proceeded to give evidence at the Basha Inquiry, in which he stated that there had been no discussion at all in his presence with the Accused or Kathy Lin concerning the Accused’s shoes or shoe size (PT405-407). He denied that he had conveyed to the Accused any information that he had been given in the New South Wales Crime Commission about the investigation of the matter (PT407).

		28 February 2017",2013-12-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705743,State of New South Wales v Cruse [2013] NSWSC 1733,"Judgment

1This is the preliminary hearing of proceedings which seek an order under s 9 Crimes (High Risk Offenders) Act 2006. The Plaintiff seeks an interim supervision order for 28 days under ss 10A and 10C with the conditions set out in Schedule 8 of the Summons. The Plaintiff also seeks an order pursuant to s 7(4) of the Act for the appointment of two qualified psychiatrists to conduct separate psychiatric examinations of the Defendant and directing the defendant to attend those examinations.

2The Defendant does not oppose the orders that are sought today but does not thereby accept that he will agree to orders being made on a final basis.

The application and the preliminary hearing

3On 9 November 2007 the Defendant was sentenced in respect of three serious sex offences being two counts of assault with an act of indecency and sexual intercourse without consent. The victim of these offences was a female known to him who was 16 years old at the time. He was sentenced overall to a non-parole period of four years commencing 10 December 2007 and concluding 9 December 2011 with an additional term of two years expiring 9 December 2013. He did not seek, and has not been granted, parole and his overall sentence is due to expire on 9 December 2013. 

4The Defendant's conviction for these offences means that he is a sex offender within the meaning of s 4 of the Act. Since the Defendant remains in custody at the present time he is a supervised sex offender - s 5I. That enables the State to make the present application - see s 5H.

5Section 7(4) of the Act provides that if, following the preliminary hearing, the court is satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation would, if proved, justify the making of an extended supervision order the Court must make orders for examination of the Defendant by (inter alia) two qualified psychiatrists. In addition under ss 10A and 10C, if the Defendant's current custody will conclude before these proceedings are determined, the Court may make an interim supervision order for a period not exceeding 28 days.

6The task of the Court at the preliminary hearing stage is not to predict the ultimate result. Rather the test is one similar to the prima facie test applied by magistrates in committal proceedings: Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119; Attorney-General for the State of New South Wales v Haytar [2007] NSWCA 993 and State of New South Wales v Thomas (Preliminary) [2011] NSWSC 118 at [11].

7In State of New South Wales v Brookes [2008] NSWSC 150 Fullerton J discussed the requirements when an interim order is sought and drew attention to the fact that because two of the objects of the Act are to ensure the safety and protection of the community and to facilitate the rehabilitation of serious sex offenders it is appropriate to give weight to risk avoidance. 

8The test that must be satisfied was formerly found in s 9(2) of the Act but is now to be found within the definition of a high risk offender in s 5B(2). Nevertheless, the wording is identical and the learning which had developed in relation to s 9(2) is equally applicable under the amended form of the Act. 

9Section 5B provides that if and only if the offender is a high risk sex offender can an extended supervision order be made. Section 5B(2) of the Act provides:

An offender is a high risk sex offender if the offender is a sex offender and the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender poses an unacceptable risk of committing a serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.

10In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v Williams [2007] WASC 206; 176 A Crim R 110 Wheeler JA (with whom Le Miere AJA agreed) said at [63]:

In my view, an ""unacceptable risk"" in the context of s 7(1) is a risk which is unacceptable having regard to a variety of considerations which may include the likelihood of the person offending, the type of sexual offence which the person is likely to commit (if that can be predicted) and the consequences of making a finding that an unacceptable risk exists. That is, the judge is required to consider whether, having regard to the likelihood of the person offending and the offence likely to be committed, the risk of that offending is so unacceptable that, notwithstanding that the person has already been punished for whatever offence they may have actually committed, it is necessary in the interests of the community to ensure that the person is subject to further control or detention.

11In Director of Public Prosecutions (WA) v GTR [2008] WASCA 187; 198 A Crim R 149 Steytler P and Buss JA said at [27]:

The word 'unacceptable' necessarily connotes a balancing exercise, requiring the court to have regard, amongst other things, for the nature of the risk (the commission of a serious sexual offence, with serious consequences for the victim) and the likelihood of the risk coming to fruition, on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the offender, on the other, if an order is made (either detention, without having committed an unpunished offence, or being required to undergo what might be an onerous supervision order). As John Fogarty points out, albeit in a rather different context (Unacceptable risk - A return to basics (2006) 20 AJFL 249, 252), the advantage of the phrase 'unacceptable risk' is that 'it is calibrated to the nature and degree of the risk, so that it can be adapted to the particular case ... '. 

12In State of New South Wales v Richardson (No. 2) [2011] NSWSC 276; (2011) 210 A Crim R 220 I said at [90]:

Two things seem to me significant when assessing the evidence and the likelihood of re-offending. The first is the higher standard of proof imposed by the words ""a high degree of probability"". The second is the notion that ""unacceptable risk"" involves a balancing exercise between the commission of a serious sexual offence and the likelihood of that risk coming to fruition on the one hand, and the serious consequences for the Defendant either because he will be detained beyond the period of his sentence although he has not committed any further offence or he will be subject to an onerous supervision order, on the other hand. It is because of that balancing exercise that it is open to the Court to be satisfied to a high degree of probability that there is an unacceptable risk but that the result of that finding (either a continuing detention order or a supervision order) may vary in a given situation. ... 

Background

13The Defendant has had earlier convictions for sexual offences. On 14 February 1975 he was convicted of carnal knowledge and committed to the care of a children's home for two years and six months. This offence involved a 15 year old girl who was severely mentally retarded.

14On 15 September 1980 he was convicted of attempted rape in the Port Augusta Criminal Court and sentenced to nine months hard labour.

15On 5 November 1984 he was convicted of sexual intercourse without consent and assault person with act of indecency. On each charge he was sentenced to three years and six months penal servitude to be served concurrently with a non-parole period of nine months. These offences involved a three year old boy. 

16On 30 April 1993 he was convicted of three counts of aggravated sexual assault. On each count he was sentenced to a minimum term of five years and six months with an additional term of two years and six months. At the same time he was sentenced for another aggravated sexual assault to a fixed term of three years. In relation to the last group of offences he was refused parole in 1998 and released at the expiry of the full term of his sentence in January 2001. These offences involved two females, one ten and one 16 years of age. 

17A number of the offences occurred whilst the Defendant claimed he was intoxicated. 

Supporting documentation

18Section 9(3) sets out matters to which the Court must have regard when considering whether to make an extended supervision order. It is necessary to have regard to those matters to decide on a prima facie case basis whether the supporting material, if proved, would justify the making of such an order. Many of the matters in s 9(3) are dealt with in the supporting documentation. I make specific reference to the following matters.

19The Defendant was examined at the request of the Commissioner of Corrective Services by a senior psychologist with the Department, Narci Sutton. She prepared a report dated 8 October 2013.

20A useful starting point is the Executive Summary of that report which relevantly says this:

Mr Cruse has a documented history of childhood trauma, as a member of the Stolen Generation, and has suffered frequent periods of clinical depression leading to suicidal ideation and behaviour. He also has a significant history of alcohol abuse, and there is evidence that the majority of his offences have been committed while heavily intoxicated.

Until his current period of incarceration Mr Cruse had been reluctant to participate in the Custody Based Intensive Treatment (CUBIT) Sex Offender Programme. He is now in the final stages of completing CUBIT and his participation appears to have been consistently conscientious. His written work, and his discussion of the dynamics of his offence behaviour demonstrate significant gains in insight.

Actuarial assessment of sexual offence risk, based on his offending history, places Mr Cruse in the high risk category relative to other sexual offenders. His therapeutic gains and reported family support may attenuate this risk level, as long as Mr Cruse remains abstinent from alcohol and committed to an offence-free life style. However in my view the stability of these gains is a yet unproven, thus his risk remains high and on-going supervision from Community Corrections would be essential to monitor his progress and assist with his goals. Mr Cruse stated that he is aware of his need for on-going assistance to maintain his treatment gains, and welcomes the added support an ESQ might provide.

21Ms Sutton carried out a series of tests and assessments on the Defendant. Two of those which concern the likelihood of sexual re-offending are the Static - 99R instrument and the Risk of Sexual Violence Protocol (RSVP). 

22The Defendant's total score on the Static - 99R was 7 which places him in the high risk category relevant to other male offenders. The recidivism rate for those who score 7 is around 5.25 times higher than the recidivism rate expected for ""typical"" sex offenders (those scoring a two on the instrument). Around 96% of the sexual offenders in the routine sample scored below the Defendant's score. 

23The Static - 99R instrument has limitations which Ms Sutton acknowledges. 

24The RSVP was developed to assist in the identification and management of a comprehensive range of factors identified by the literature as related to sexual offending. It includes a total of 22 both static and dynamic factors grouped into five domains, sexual violence history, psychological adjustment, mental disorder, social adjustment and manageability. These factors are not mutually exclusive. 

25It is not necessary to detail all of the sub-categories of the five domains and how the Defendant fits into those categories and meets the criteria. It is sufficient to note that Ms Sutton concludes that the Defendant presents with risk factors in all but one of the domains covered by the RSVP. That, she said, suggests that the high risk score on the Static - 99R is an accurate reflection of his risk. 

26She concluded that when the Defendant is likely to re-offend it would most likely be while intoxicated. It is likely to be spontaneous rather than be preceded by the grooming of the victim. The offence is likely to unfold quickly and the victim is more likely to be an adolescent girl. 

27Ms Sutton also said that the Defendant's long history of sexual re-offending suggests that without ongoing support to implement the skills learnt in therapy, at least in the early stages after his release, he was likely to return to the high risk behaviours associated with his offending. 

28Ms Sutton examined various documents made available to her dealing with the Defendant's response to supervision at various times including when he had been on parole. His record in that regard was somewhat mixed although the most recent conditional liberty in 2005 was completed satisfactorily.

29A risk management report prepared by the Community Corrections Extended Supervision Team dated 25 October 2013 demonstrates that the Defendant is capable of being managed within the community in a way that minimises any risk of further offending. This plan involves a referral of the Defendant to the Nunyara Community Offender Support Program for transitional accommodation. The report notes that electronic monitoring could be utilised for the Defendant if the Court considered that was desirable. 

30I have also read what is contained in the affidavit of Zouhier Abedine which provides greater detail concerning what would be proposed, bearing in mind the conditions that the State asks to be imposed upon the Defendant.

31The report by the Community Corrections Extended Supervision Team and, to some extent, the affidavit of Mr Abedine, deal with such other matters as the Defendant's drug and alcohol issues, his mental health issues, employment and access to children as well as possible pharmacological intervention. It proposed a review of his conditions on a six-monthly basis.

32Case notes from the High Risk Offenders Review Group tend to show a positive change in attitude towards dealing with his sexual offending. An example of this occurred in October/November 2012 when the Defendant was enrolled in the CUBIT program commencing 24 October. He was then keen to complete the program and did not wish to apply for parole until he had done so. Reports subsequent to that time were positive about his progress. Ms Sutton made a similar assessment.

Determination

33I note the proposed conditions in Schedule A to the Summons. I note also that those conditions are agreed to on an interim basis by the Defendant. Without preventing argument at the final hearing about the suitability of any of those conditions, I consider that those conditions are suitable to be imposed for any interim order including the proposal for electronic monitoring.

34In the present case the evidence put forward by the Plaintiff is sufficient, if proved, to justify the making of an extended supervision order. In those circumstances I will make orders in terms of paragraphs 1 to 11 contained in the Order provided.

35The matter is listed for hearing on 26 February 2104 with an estimate of 1 to 2 days. There will be liberty in the meantime to re-list on 3 days' notice.

2705744,State of New South Wales v Beck; Commissioner of Police v Beck [2013] NSWCA 437,"HEADNOTE

[This Headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

An off-duty police officer urinated on a public street in the early hours of the morning. He was subsequently charged with an offence under s 4(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW). The charge was later withdrawn. The officer was demoted in rank. He brought proceedings against the State of NSW for malicious prosecution and brought other proceedings seeking prerogative relief against the Commissioner for Police in relation to the decision to demote him. 

In the malicious prosecution proceedings, no evidence was adduced by the State. At the close of evidence in the plaintiff's case the State sought the summary dismissal of the proceedings on the basis that there was 'no case' to answer. That application was dismissed. Leave to adduce evidence was not then sought by the State. The trial judge proceeded to give judgment for the plaintiff. 

The trial judge awarded $50,000 in general damages, $80,000 in exemplary damages and costs on an indemnity basis. 

As to the prerogative relief proceedings, the trial judge quashed the decision to demote the off-duty officer and ordered the Commissioner of Police to pay part of the costs of the proceedings. 

Each of the Commissioner and the State of NSW appealed from the respective decisions against them.

Held (allowing the appeal in relation to the malicious prosecution proceedings):

(1) His Honour failed to use the advantage available to him as trial judge by failing to have regard to the totality of the evidence, which included the unsworn and untested police statements (per Ward JA at [62]).

Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; (1959) 101 CLR 298 considered. 

(2) The findings of fabrication of evidence and commission of criminal offences were serious findings to be made only on the application of the Briginshaw standard. Having regard to the manner in which the trial judge treated the conclusion reached on the 'no case' application as determinative of liability on the malicious prosecution case, the Court could not be satisfied that the Briginshaw standard was properly applied (per Ward JA at [72]). 

Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34 (1938) 60 CLR 336 considered. 

(3) Challenge to certain of the factual findings in relation to fabrication were made out (per Ward JA at [119]).

(4) In relation to the exemplary damages award, the trial judge took into account an irrelevant consideration, namely the subsequent conduct of the police in considering the question of demotion of the officer (per Ward JA at [129]).

Held (granting leave to appeal and allowing the appeal in relation to the prerogative relief proceedings): 

(5) It was open to the Commissioner to conclude that it was seriously inappropriate and unacceptable conduct for a police officer to urinate in a public street in the early hours of the morning whilst under the influence of alcohol (Barrett JA at [2]).

(6) It could not be said to be manifestly unreasonable for the decision maker to come to the view that, on the officer's own version of events, the officer's conduct was seriously inappropriate and unacceptable and did not comply with the spirit of the Police Code of Conduct (per Ward JA at [153]).

(7) The trial judge misapplied the hypothetical ordinary reasonable person test for an offence under s 4(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW) (per Ward JA at [164]).




			Judgment

 

1BEAZLEY P: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the comprehensive reasons of Ward JA. I agree with her Honour's reasons and with the orders she proposes in respect of each of the matters before the Court. I would only add the following additional comments in relation to the State's application for a non suit under the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (UCPR), r 29.9(4) and its consequential application for a verdict by direction under UCPR, r 29.10.

 

2Both those applications were, it seems to me, misconceived. There was evidence in Mr Beck's case, which, taken at its highest, supported a claim of malicious prosecution. In the choice made by the State upon rejection of its application under r 29.9(4), to seek a verdict by direction rather than to call evidence, it could not be said that it was unlikely on the evidence that Mr Beck could not succeed on its claim. Further, given that there were questions of credit involved, the case was likely, in any event, to be an unsuitable vehicle for a verdict by direction: see Naiama Pastoral Company Pty Ltd v Plan 4 Insurance Services Pty Ltd [2010] SASC 105; 107 SASR 42; Fleming's Law of Torts, 10th ed (2011) Thomson Reuters.

 

3Leaving that aside, however, once the applications were made and determined, the task required of the trial judge was no longer to assess the evidence in Mr Beck's case at its highest. The task was to determine, on a consideration of the whole of the evidence, whether Mr Beck had established his case.

 

4I have given serious consideration to whether his Honour's reference to the evidence, contained in the statements of the police officers, as being ""worthless"" was no more than a finding that he did not accept their evidence. After a consideration of the whole of the evidence, I consider that the finding was more than that and it was in error.

 

5As Ward JA has carefully explained, there were aspects of the police evidence and, indeed, crucial aspects, particularly the estimation of the distance from Oxford Street to where Mr Beck was standing, which were essentially the same as the evidence of the witnesses called in Mr Beck's case. His Honour made no adverse comment upon the apparently wrong estimates made by those witnesses, yet considered that the police had deliberately fabricated their evidence on that matter.

 

6His Honour needed to consider, in all the circumstances, whether the estimates of distance were merely miscalculations, as seems to have been likely. Had he done so, his assessment of the evidence in the police statements may have been quite different. If that turned out to be the case, the assessment of whether Mr Beck's malicious prosecution claim had been made out would have been approached differently. In saying that, I do not suggest that the outcome would have been different. Rather, the State was entitled to have its case assessed upon a proper consideration of the whole of the evidence.

 

7I also agree with the additional comments of Barrett JA. The Police Service is entitled to expect an appropriate standard of behaviour of its officers, including when they are off duty. I do not consider that Mr Beck's conduct on the night which became subject of the charge laid against him was appropriate or acceptable behaviour and the Commissioner was entitled to take the course he did in demoting Mr Beck.

 

8BARRETT JA: In relation to both the malicious prosecution appeal and the appeal in respect of the quashing of the Commissioner's disciplinary decision, the outcome should be as Ward JA proposes. I agree with her Honour's assessment and reasons. As to the disciplinary aspect, I agree, in particular, that it was well open to the Commissioner to form the view that the respondent's conduct (which was, on his own account, urinating in a public street in the early hours of the morning while under the influence of alcohol) was, for a police officer, seriously inappropriate and unacceptable conduct.

 

9WARD JA: Before this Court for hearing on 8 November 2013 were two matters, each relating to an incident that occurred in Surry Hills in the early hours of 25 September 2006. Mr Beck, then a police officer who was off duty at the time, had been with friends to nightclubs in Oxford Street. At around 3.20am, he urinated in a gutter on the eastern side of Pelican Street south of the intersection between Pelican and Oxford Streets. That incidence led to a chain of events that culminated in a successful claim by Mr Beck for damages for malicious prosecution and the making, and subsequent quashing, of a decision to reduce Mr Beck's then rank in the police force.

 

10The present proceedings involve the appeal by the State against the malicious prosecution decision and an application for leave to appeal by the Commissioner of Police from the quashing of the decision in relation to Mr Beck's rank.

 

Background

 

11At the time of the incident, Mr Beck was on the eastern side of Pelican Street at a distance he later measured as being 38 metres from the intersection of Oxford and Pelican Streets, but which was initially estimated (both by Mr Beck and his friends on the one hand and by the police officers who were there at the relevant time), as being closer to the corner of Oxford Street (somewhere around 15-20 metres). Mr Beck's friends were on the western side of Pelican Street and were further south down that street than Mr Beck. Mr Beck was on the opposite side of the street to, though further down from, a Hungry Jack's restaurant.

 

12Mr Beck was observed by two police officers (Sergeant Sullivan and Sergeant Deas) who were in a marked police vehicle that had turned left from Oxford Street into Pelican Street. What they in fact observed, or were able to observe, at that time (having regard to the position of Mr Beck, the light in the area and the precise time during the course of the incident that they turned into Pelican Street) was hotly in dispute. They stopped and spoke with Mr Beck. He identified himself as an off-duty police officer. Acting Inspector Dempsey (who was the duty officer at Kings Cross police station at the time) and Detective Acting Inspector Birley attended the scene shortly afterwards and spoke with Mr Beck.

 

13No formal arrest of Mr Beck was made. However, a court attendance notice was later issued, by Sergeant Sullivan as prosecutor, on 17 November 2006 charging Mr Beck with an offence under s 4(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW) (Blue 62). The offence was described in the court attendance notice as:

 

Behave in offensive manner in/near/within view from/within hearing from a public place/school between 3:20am and 3:45am on 25/09/2006 at Surry Hills.

 

did conduct himself in an offensive manner in a public place, to wit, Pelican Street, Surry Hills.

 

14The attached facts sheet gave further details of the alleged offence. Relevantly, the facts sheet stated that Mr Beck did not appear intoxicated and that he was in full view of the police officers (and continued urinating after the police car had stopped beside him).

 

15On 10 January 2007, Mr Beck's solicitor attended the Local Court and entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. Subsequently, submissions were made to the Director of Public Prosecutions on behalf of Mr Beck. On 21 February 2007, following the decision of the Director not to proceed with the matter, the charge against Mr Beck was withdrawn and dismissed (Blue 69). That was not, however, the end of the matter.

 

16On 16 August 2007, a decision was made (by a delegate of the Commissioner of Police) not to recommend the promotion of Mr Beck (who was then a level 5 constable due for promotion to a level 1 senior constable subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions). The decision not to recommend Mr Beck's promotion was stated to be ""pending finalisation of IRP/181D notification""; a reference to a recommendation that had by then been made for the referral of the matter to the Commissioner of Police for consideration by the Commissioner as to whether an order should be made for the removal of Mr Beck from the police force under s 181D of the Police Act 1990 (NSW).

 

17No order for the removal of Mr Beck from the police force was ultimately made. Rather, the s 181D notification culminated in the issue of a warning notice to Mr Beck, on behalf of the Commissioner, on 10 January 2008 (Blue 184), accompanied by a Statement of Reasons (Blue 185-186). Again, that was not the end of the matter.

 

18On 30 January 2008, a notice was issued to Mr Beck under s 173(5) of the Act (Blue 181), notifying him that consideration was being given to the making of a reviewable order against him, namely an order that he be reduced in increment from the rank of Constable Level 5 to Constable Level 3. On 25 February 2008, Mr Beck submitted a response thereto (Blue 187), to which he annexed, among other things, statutory declarations signed by the three witnesses (three of the friends who were with him on the night in question) who in due course gave oral evidence in the proceedings now the subject of appeal.

 

19A decision was made by Superintendent Crandell on 22 September 2008 to reduce Mr Beck in rank from a level 5 constable to a level 3 constable and an order under s 173(2) was made to that effect (Blue 235-236). In the notification of that order, Superintendent Crandell stated that he was satisfied that Mr Beck had breached the NSW Police Force Code of Conduct and Ethics - ""Statement of Values"" and ""Private Conduct"", extracts of which were there set out. The latter (dealing with the private conduct of police officers) included the statement that:

 

All officers have an obligation to act and to be seen to act by the public in accordance with the spirit and the letter of the law including the terms of this Code of Conduct whether on or off duty.

 

20Superintendent Crandell stated that he had carefully considered the matters raised in the 30 January 2008 notice, and Mr Beck's response thereto, and that:

 

I note that you have admitted that, at about 3:20am on 25 September 2006, while off duty, you urinated in Pelican Street, Surry Hills. You have asserted you did so ""out of urgent necessity'. However, given your general location as well as your proximity to an open Hungry Jacks restaurant on the corner of Oxford Street and Pelican Street, I have formed the view that you could have easily found and used a toilet had you wished to do so.

 

I note there is considerable dispute as to the degree to which your actions could be seen by persons in the Hungry Jacks restaurant. However, regardless of your exact position while urinating, it is clear from your own admissions that you must have removed your penis from your pants and urinated in a public place. Even if I were to fully accept your version of events as to your exact location and position, I still regard your conduct as seriously inappropriate and unacceptable. Indeed, it is highly likely that it amounted to a criminal offence, even although the DPP decided not to proceed with charges. 

 

...

 

In all of the circumstances I have formed the view that your conduct has been seriously inappropriate and unacceptable and that you should be subject to the action proposed in the notice dated 30 January 2008. (my emphasis)

 

21Mr Beck then commenced two separate proceedings.

 

22The first was a claim against the State of New South Wales for malicious prosecution brought by statement of claim filed on 9 October 2008. In his initial claim, Mr Beck alleged, among other things, that he had been unlawfully arrested; that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas had each fabricated evidence and lied in the creation of their contemporaneous notes and/or police statements; and that the stated observations of Sergeants Sullivan and Deas were physically impossible. In the final version of Mr Beck's pleading (the Further Amended Statement of Claim filed with leave on the second day of the hearing on 14 February 2012 - Black 111.27), the allegation of unlawful arrest was not pursued. The allegation of fabrication was expanded. It was alleged that Sergeants Deas and Sullivan had each prepared police statements making false accusations of Mr Beck's conduct (paras [7] and [8] of the further amended statement of claim) and that Sergeant Sullivan had prepared a court attendance notice containing false accusations of Mr Beck's conduct (at [11]).

 

23Mr Beck's allegation in the malicious prosecution proceedings was that the State of New South Wales, by its servants and/or agents identified as ""the nominated members of the New South Wales Police Force and particularly Sergeant Kevin Sullivan"", had laid the court attendance notice without reasonable and probable cause ([15]) and did so maliciously ([16]). Mr Beck claimed damage to his reputation, as well as loss and damage including special damage (particularised at [17]). He sought an award of exemplary damages in addition to the special damage claimed.

 

24The second proceeding was an application for prerogative relief against the Commissioner of Police in respect of the decisions made on 16 August 2007 and 22 September 2008, to which I have referred above (at [16] and [19]).

 

25The two sets of proceedings were heard together by Adams J in February 2012, with evidence in each to be regarded as evidence in the other. His Honour found for Mr Beck in the malicious prosecution proceedings, awarding him, among other amounts, the sum of $50,000 in general damages and the further sum of $80,000 in exemplary damages, as well as costs of the proceedings on an indemnity basis. His Honour dismissed the claim for prerogative relief in relation to the first (16 August 2007) decision but upheld the claim in relation to the second (22 September 2008) decision, quashing that decision and ordering the Commissioner of Police to pay Mr Beck's costs of the prerogative relief proceedings but only in relation to the decision of 22 September 2008.

 

26What is now before this Court is the appeal by the State of New South Wales from the decision in the malicious prosecution proceedings and the application by the Commissioner of Police for leave to appeal from the quashing of Superintendent Crandell's decision; the latter application being dealt with as a concurrent hearing of the leave application and the appeal itself. I will deal with those matters in the order in which they were argued before this Court.

 

Proceedings before Adams J

 

27In the malicious prosecution proceedings, Mr Beck relied upon his affidavit sworn 10 December 2010 (Blue 11) and affidavits from three of the four people who were with him at the time of the incident (Mr McHenry - Blue 5; Ms Shillitoe - Blue 8; and Mr Saba - Blue 97). Each gave oral evidence and was cross-examined.

 

28Mr Beck also tendered in his case the respective police statements: Sergeant Sullivan's statement dated 29 October 2006 (Blue 53-56); Sergeant Deas' statement dated 13 October 2006 (Blue 50-52); as well as reports signed by Acting Inspector Dempsey on 25 September 2006 (Blue 42-43); Sergeant Sullivan on 26 September 2006 (Blue 44-47); the court attendance notice (Blue 62) and the facts sheet (Blue 63-65). The police statements were admitted into evidence in Mr Beck's case without any limitation as to the use to which they might be put.

 

29No evidence was adduced by the defendant in the malicious prosecution proceedings. The circumstances in which that decision was made require some explanation, since (at [46]) the primary judge prefaced his factual findings with a statement as to the worthlessness of the police statements on the basis that the respective officers had not been called and cross-examined on those statements. The primary judge noted the course of events in this regard from [17]-[19] of his reasons.

 

""No case"" application

 

30At the close of Mr Beck's case for damages, the State made an application under Rule 29.9 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) for the dismissal of the proceedings on the ground that, on the evidence given, a judgment for the plaintiff could not be supported (Black 111.37). Mr Beck, as it was open to him to do, declined to argue the question raised by that application. Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 29.9(4), the Court could not make an order under Rule 29.9. It then fell to the State to elect either to adduce evidence or to make an application under Rule 29.10 (Rule 29.9(5)). The State elected to take the latter course (Black 115.35).

 

31On an application under Rule 29.10, the applicant (here the State) must satisfy the Court that, on the evidence given, a judgment for the 'beginning party' (here, Mr Beck) could not be supported. As the primary judge noted, in dealing with a submission of ""no case to answer"" it is said that the question is to be approached by taking the evidence of the plaintiff at its highest.

 

32His Honour rejected the application by the State for judgment under Rule 29.10. He did so on the basis that, assuming for the purposes of the ""no case"" application that Mr Beck's evidence was true, the statement of Sergeant Sullivan was fundamentally contradicted by Mr Beck's evidence. His Honour concluded that the police prosecutor could not honestly have believed the case that was instituted or maintained when it was based on a fabrication. In other words, taking Mr Beck's evidence at its highest, his Honour concluded that the police officer prosecuting the case had fabricated evidence against Mr Beck. In so doing, his Honour thus excluded (or had no regard to) the possibility that the contradiction between the police statements and the evidence called for Mr Beck could have been the product of something other than fabrication (such as, for example, an honest but mistaken belief by the police officers who made the statements on which the decision to prosecute Mr Beck was based). The complaint now made is in effect, that once his Honour had reached that conclusion on the no case application his Honour simply translated the finding on that application to a finding on the substantive case.

 

33In his Honour's later published reasons for rejecting the ""no case to answer"" application, the primary judge expressly adopted the test in Hunt v Watkins (2000) 49 NSWLR 508 and found that, taking the evidence of Mr Beck at its highest, the charge against Mr Beck was fabricated and there was ample evidence upon which a judgment for Mr Beck could be supported ([38]).

 

34At [44], his Honour concluded that if the evidence of Mr Beck and the three other witnesses were accepted then there could be no doubt that Sergeant Sullivan ""well knew where the truth lay"" and that the statement of facts attached to the court attendance notice was false ""in every crucial respect"". His Honour concluded that it followed from this that Sergeant Sullivan knew that Mr Beck was not guilty and that this was sufficient to establish absence of reasonable and probable cause to bring the criminal prosecution.

 

35At [45], his Honour found that if Mr Beck and his witnesses were accepted then the dominant purpose of Sergeant Sullivan was to procure a conviction upon facts he knew to be fabricated, believing that, in truth, Mr Beck had committed no criminal offence.

 

36His Honour's decision on the Rule 29.10 application, during the course of the hearing, had the consequence, pursuant to Rule 29.10(4), that the State was then not able to adduce evidence or further evidence in the proceedings except by the leave of the Court.

 

37No application for leave to adduce evidence was made by the State (Black 148.19). It may be, from my review of the transcript of the earlier discussion between Counsel and his Honour, that no such application was made having regard to what had fallen from his Honour. At Black 140.15, his Honour said that he did not think he would be minded to give leave to the State to attempt to weaken the plaintiff's case and made the observation that to do so would destroy the whole purpose of the proceeding. Whatever the reason, a forensic decision was made by the State at that point not to seek leave to adduce evidence in its defence.

 

38His Honour, having formally refused the application for judgment under Rule 29.10, then proceeded immediately to find against the State, saying that ""[i]t follows, I think, that I must give judgment for the plaintiff"". The question of damages was reserved and his Honour proceeded to hear argument as to damages, reserving his reasons on the ruling that had been made on the State's application under Rule 29.10.

 

39Thus, his Honour seems to have proceeded on the basis that the conclusion reached for the purposes of the ""no case"" application was necessarily determinative of the case in favour of Mr Beck without further consideration or balancing of such evidence as there was in support of the defendant's case or that contradicted the plaintiff's case.

 

40Pausing here, I note that the common law rule on a ""no case to answer"" application, explained in Tate v Johnson (1953) 53 SR (NSW) 492 and James v ANZ Banking Group Ltd (No 2) (1985) 9 FCR 448 as noted in the commentary to Rule 29.10 in Ritchie's, was that if a ""no case"" submission was made the Court had a discretion whether to put the defendant to an election about calling evidence before ruling on the ""no case"" submission and would ordinarily require the defendant to make such an election (Laurie v Raglan [1942] 1 KB 152; Alexander v Rayson [1936] 1 KB 169). Furthermore, the ordinary position at common law was that a defendant was not permitted to call further evidence once a ""no case to answer"" application had been made and determined by the Court (Builders Licensing Board v Mahoney (1986) 5 NSWLR 96).

 

41The procedure under the Rules, however, now permits evidence to be given if leave is granted. Nevertheless, in the course of argument on the ""no case"" application, the primary judge had expressed the opinion that such leave would only rarely be given (see Black 138.8).

 

Primary judgment

 

42On the material that was in evidence before his Honour, there were material differences between Mr Beck's version of events and that contained in the statements of Sergeants Sullivan and Deas (and in the facts sheet attached to the court attendance notice) going to whether it was possible for the police officers to have seen Mr Beck urinating in the gutter when they turned into Pelican Street (or, if they could, whether they could have seen his penis at the time).

 

43The police statements, in effect, put Mr Beck as standing at the rear of a parked black Peugeot hatchback, facing north or angled towards Oxford Street, with his penis clearly exposed and making no attempt to conceal it. Mr Beck said that he was standing at the ""B pillar"" of the hatchback with his back to Oxford Street and that he had concealed his penis with his left hand while urinating. Further, there were differences between the respective versions of events as to whether, when Sergeant Sullivan got out of the police car and spoke to Mr Beck, Mr Beck had continued to urinate and made no attempt to conceal himself from Sergeant Sullivan, as the police version asserted; and as to Sergeant Sullivan's statement that he had heard Mr Beck refer to himself, in a conversation between Inspector Dempsey and Mr Beck, as a ""fag"", which Mr Beck vehemently denied doing and which was regarded by Mr Beck as a derogatory term.

 

44The critical differences, for the purposes of whether there was reasonable cause to institute and maintain a prosecution against Mr Beck for offensive conduct, went to where Mr Beck was standing when urinating in the gutter in Pelican Street (which went to whether the police officers could have seen what their statements recorded them as having observed) and to the general location (which went to the question whether a person who might have been in the vicinity could have observed what Mr Beck was doing).

 

45There was no denial by Mr Beck that he had urinated in the gutter. That said, in his detailed s 173 response Mr Beck somewhat inconsistently stated that ""[t]here is no reference [seemingly in the statements by Sergeants Sullivan and/or Deas] to physical evidence in source documents such as the wet mark on the ground that one would leave after urinating"" (Blue 205K) (contradicted by his earlier statement at Blue 192D-J).

 

46Significantly, there was an inconsistency between the statements of Sergeants Sullivan and Deas (repeated in the facts sheet) and the statement of Inspector Dempsey and evidence of Mr Beck and Mr Beck's witnesses as to whether Mr Beck appeared to be intoxicated.

 

47His Honour summarised the evidence given by the three witnesses called by Mr Beck (at [12] to [16]). His Honour found that each of Mr Beck and the three witnesses was a truthful, or candid, witness and each was reliable ([16], [44] and [46]). His Honour accepted Mr Beck's evidence.

 

48At [46], his Honour set out his decision on the evidence, stating that:

 

...In light of the failure of [the State] to call the police officers, their statements, although providing evidence of the facts asserted in them, are worthless in respect of any matters contradicted by the sworn testimony given before me. I have no doubt that I should accept the evidence of the plaintiff and the other witnesses as truthful and reliable. In short I am satisfied that Sergeant Sullivan and Sergeant Deas fabricated not only the circumstances in which they first saw the plaintiff and what he was then doing but also his position in the street and in respect to the parked car. They also lied about the light whether from street lighting or Hungry Jack's, at the place where the plaintiff was standing. In my view, also, (in this respect supported by the evidence of Sergeant Dempsey) they lied about the plaintiff's sobriety (probably to remove one of the reasons for not going to the SPC). (my emphasis)

 

49His Honour continued at [46] to say:

 

I do not accept, either, that the toilet facilities at Hungry Jack's were available simply to members of the public as distinct from patrons, or that the plaintiff would have been able to use the toilets at the Sydney Police Centre or that there was any other public toilet available to him in the near vicinity. It follows that the conclusions which I have stated above as to the inferences that follow from acceptance of the witnesses' evidence remain appropriate.

 

50At [47], his Honour said:

 

I should add that I do not accept that Sergeant Sullivan's account of the conversation - nor that of Sergeant Deas, to the extent that it corroborates it - is truthful in respect of those parts in which it differs from that given by the plaintiff. Moreover, even if it were accepted, it certainly does not demonstrate that the plaintiff was ""rude, abrupt, dismissive of his actions, [with] no respect for rank"". Insofar as the plaintiff's denial of the officer's allegation goes, asserting that he had his back to Oxford Street, he did not attempt to lie at all but was telling the truth as both officers well knew. As I said above, their characterisation of the nature conversation [sic] was itself manufactured.

 

51His Honour, in considering the exemplary damages claim, said (at [68]):

 

In this case, the actions of Sergeants Sullivan and Dias [sic] were proved to be deliberate, concerted, elaborate, reprehensible and contumelious involving the making of false statements (a criminal offence under s 85 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986) and an attempt to pervert the course of justice (an offence under s319 of the Crimes Act 1900). These are serious offences against public justice, involving far more than an assault on the rights of the plaintiff. The condemnation of the Court must be unmistakeably demonstrated.

 

52At [69], his Honour added that the response of the officers whose responsibility it was to consider whether action should be taken against Mr Beck was ""woefully inadequate"", noting that the allegations made by Mr Beck against Sergeants Sullivan and Deas were extremely serious ""involving the commission of criminal offences"". His Honour noted that Mr Beck's response to the first s 181D notice indicated that Mr Beck was with friends on the occasion in question but that no attempt had been made to interview them and that the response to the 30 January 2008 notice included statutory declarations of those persons but that no investigation as to the truthfulness of the Sergeants' statements had been undertaken. His Honour considered that there had been a ""gross failure of responsible management"" that enlivened the relevance, to the assessment of exemplary damages, of a passage in NSW v Ibbet [2006] HCA 57; (2006) 229 CLR 638 at 646-647 to the effect that the assessment of exemplary damages in a case of conscious and contumelious disregard by the police of plaintiff's rights ""should also be such as to bring home to those officials of the State who are responsible for the overseeing of the police force that police officers must be trained and disciplined so that abuses ... do not happen"".

 

Appeal in malicious prosecution proceedings

 

53The State's appeal from the malicious prosecution decision, apart from taking issue with the amount awarded by way of exemplary damages if the decision is otherwise to stand, challenges the decision in essence on two bases: first, it is submitted that his Honour did not take into account or give any weight to the evidence setting out the police officers' version of events; and, second, it is submitted that the serious findings made in respect of the conduct of Sergeants Sullivan and Deas required satisfaction to the Briginshaw standard (Briginshaw v Briginshaw [1938] HCA 34; (1938) 60 CLR 336), to which his Honour made no reference in the reasons.

 

54Criticism is also made of various of the findings made by his Honour that are said either not to have been open on the evidence or to have been inconsistent with material in Mr Beck's case that favoured the police officers' version of events.

 

55The State contends that his Honour erred:

 

(a) in holding that documents tendered in Mr Beck's case which contained material favourable to the State's case were ""worthless"" (ground 4);

(b) in failing to find that the said documents and other evidence contained material favourable to the State (ground 5);

(c) in failing to assess the contents of the said documents and other evidence and allot weight thereto in light of the remainder of the evidence (ground 6);

(d) in making findings amounting to criminal conduct on the part of Sergeant Sullivan and Sergeant Deas without having applied the Briginshaw test to the evidence (ground 7);

(e) in making the following findings of fact (ground 8):

(i) that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas fabricated the position of Mr Beck in the street and in respect of the parked car;

(ii) that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas lied in statements about the light including light from Hungry Jacks;

(iii) that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas lied that toilet facilities at Hungry Jacks were only available to patrons and not the public;

(iv) that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas lied that toilet facilities were not available to Mr Beck at the Sydney Police Centre;

(v) that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas lied that public toilet facilities were not available in the near vicinity;

(vi) that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas lied about Mr Beck's state of sobriety and demeanour; and

(vii) that Mr Beck was not facing angled towards Hungry Jacks when first seen by Sergeants Sullivan and Deas.

(f) in not finding to the contrary in respect of each of the findings of fact the subject of ground 8 of the grounds of appeal (ground 9); and

(g) in the assessment of the amount of exemplary damages (ground 10).

 

56I consider those grounds of appeal as follows.

 

Grounds 4-6 - evidentiary weight of the police statements in circumstances where the defence adduced no evidence

 

57These grounds go to the assessment by his Honour of the evidence before him and, in particular, to his Honour's statement (at [46]) that the statements of the police officers (presumably including in this not only Sergeants Sullivan and Deas but also the statement of Inspector Dempsey), though providing evidence of the facts asserted in them, were ""worthless"" because the police officers had not been called to give evidence.

 

58Senior Counsel for the State, Mr Neil QC, submits that the State was entitled to have his Honour consider material favourable to the State that was contained in the documents tendered by Mr Beck, even though it did not call oral evidence in the case, and that his Honour erred in principle in failing to assess such material in light of all of the evidence. Reference was made in this regard to R v Higgins (1829) 3 C&P 603; 172 ER 565; Jack v Smail (1905) 2 CLR 684; R v Williamson [1972] 2 NSWLR 281; and Ceva Logistics (Australia) Pty Limited v Redbro Investments [2013] NSWCA 46. Mr Neil submits that the question was one of the weight to be attached to evidence that was not tested in cross-examination and that his Honour erred in dismissing outright the evidence as worthless.

 

59Mr Neil pointed to the statement of Inspector Dempsey, for example, as recording the contemporaneous version of events given by Sergeants Deas and Sullivan as to Mr Beck's initial attitude, though he concedes that Inspector Dempsey's statement did not support the statements made by Sergeants Sullivan and Deas as to Mr Beck's state of sobriety.

 

60Mr Neil submits that if his Honour had considered all the material favourable to the State, giving it such weight as his Honour saw fit prior to making his decision as to which version to accept, there was a realistic prospect that his Honour may not have been satisfied to the requisite standard that Mr Beck had proven his case and therefore that the State has been deprived of a reasonable opportunity to have its case fully considered at law and the matter should be remitted for a new trial.

 

61Counsel for Mr Beck, Mr Cleary, submits that his Honour was entitled completely to reject the version of events outlined in the police statements that had been tendered, on the basis that they were not called as witnesses, and to accept Mr Beck's version of events.

 

62As to his Honour's description of the police statements as worthless, Mr Cleary submits that, properly understood, his Honour's reasons make clear that he accepted that the untested statements of the police officers provided evidence of the facts asserted in them but was of the view they were of no weight (hence worthless) insofar as they contradicted the sworn testimony of Mr Beck and the three witnesses called by Mr Beck.

 

63Mr Cleary submits that the rule in Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; (1959) 101 CLR 298 permitted an inference to be drawn that the evidence that could have been given by the police officers would not have helped the State's defence and entitled his Honour more readily to draw the inference that the criminal prosecution was based on fabricated evidence (that being an inference that he submits is open from the other evidence adduced in Mr Beck's case).

 

64As to the drawing of adverse inferences from the fact that the police were not tested in cross-examination as to the version of events set out in their statements, there was an explanation for the fact that the police officers were not called upon in the defence case, namely, the forensic disadvantage to which the State was put when its ""no case"" application was dismissed. However, that would not preclude the drawing of a Jones v Dunkel inference in favour of Mr Beck. Indeed, Jones v Dunkel was a case where an adverse inference was said to be properly available in circumstances where Counsel had unsuccessfully asked for a verdict by direction and could not then call the relevant witness to give evidence. Windeyer J (in the majority) said (at p 331):

 

I have written this lengthy excursus to make it clear that the proper inference to be drawn from the absence of [the truck driver] from the witness-box is not to be cut down because his counsel by asking for a verdict by direction could not thereafter call him as a witness. Had counsel wished to preserve a right to call evidence if the judge should rule that there was a case to answer, he could have asked for a non-suit. The idea that this course was not open is, I have sought to show, based on a misconception. Moreover, the words which counsel used when he applied for a verdict show that he accepted the consequences of the course he took and knowingly elected not to call evidence. The jury, when they asked, should therefore have been told fully of the inference they could draw from the silence of [the truck driver] whom counsel had deliberately chosen not to call.

 

65The statement of Counsel to which his Honour had there referred was to the effect that when Counsel asked for a direction to the jury to return a verdict for the defendants it was indicated that he would not call any evidence (at p 300.4). As I read the transcript there was no such statement made in the present case although it was appreciated that leave would be necessary to adduce evidence if the no case application were to fail.

 

66Relevantly, a Jones v Dunkel inference would permit his Honour, where there were competing inferences available on the evidence, more comfortably to accept Mr Beck's version of events but it would not permit a positive finding that had the police officers been tested in cross-examination that evidence would have been damaging to the defence case (HML v R (2008) 235 CLR 334; Cross on Evidence, JD Heydon, 8th edn [1215]). Therefore I have difficulty with the proposition that the fact that the police officers were not called carried with it the inevitable consequence that the divergence between the evidence called in Mr Beck's case and the police statements warranted an inference that one or more of the police officers had knowingly falsified his or their evidence. In any event, what was necessary was for his Honour to have had regard to all the evidence, including the untested police statements for what weight his Honour considered they were worth, (and to apply the Briginshaw standard before making findings of criminal conduct against the police officers) in determining the question of liability once the no case application had failed. It appears from the manner in which his Honour proceeded immediately to find for Mr Beck as a consequence of failure of the no case application that his Honour did not at that point do so.

 

67It is submitted by Mr Cleary that there is no unfairness in his Honour's acceptance of Mr Beck's version of events, since it was the State that made the decision not to call any witnesses at the trial, the consequence of which being that Mr Beck's version of events, as corroborated by his witnesses, was accepted by his Honour. However, a finding by his Honour that no or little weight could be placed on the unsworn and untested police statements is one thing; a dismissal out of hand of those statements as worthless is another. The manner in which his Honour proceeded, immediately from rejection of the Rule 29.10 application, to a finding that it ""followed"" that judgment should be entered for Mr Beck on his claim indicates that his Honour did not at that point consider the weight, if any, to be attached to parts of the police statements that were or might be said to be inconsistent with Mr Beck's case and simply assumed that acceptance of Mr Beck's evidence proved that the police officers were lying. This was not a case where his Honour reserved his judgment on liability. He announced judgment immediately as a consequence of the finding on the ""no case to answer"" application and the fact that no application was made for leave to adduce evidence by the State at that stage.

 

68In that regard, his Honour appears to have failed to use the advantage available to him as a trial judge by failing to have regard to the totality of the evidence, which included the unsworn and untested police statements.

 

69Grounds 4-6 are in my view made out.

 

Ground 7 - findings of fabrication

 

70The second main ground of appeal relates to the findings that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas fabricated their evidence and deliberately committed criminal offences under s 85 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 (at [68]). His Honour recognised that such conduct involved the commission of serious offences against public justice. His Honour may (in describing the conduct as ""concerted"") also have intended a finding that there was collusion between the two officers or that they acted in concert in so doing, though this was not expressed as such.

 

71It is not disputed that such findings were very serious. There is no doubt (and this was not disputed by Mr Cleary) that his Honour was required, before making findings of criminal conduct on the part of the police officers, to approach the determination of such matters with ""much care and caution, weight being given to the presumption of innocence and exactness of proof expected"" (Briginshaw at 347), and to have an actual persuasion, on the balance of probabilities, of the relevant matters giving rise to such a conclusion.

 

72The complaint made in respect of those findings is that there is nothing in the judgment from which one could infer that his Honour had had regard to the level of satisfaction required for such a finding to be made, namely the application of the so-called Briginshaw standard (Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336). Mr Neil submits that his Honour's reference to the police statements being ""worthless"", and the lack of any acknowledgement in his Honour's reasons as to the need for there to be a high degree of satisfaction on the balance of probabilities as to those findings, suggest that his Honour had not done so. Mr Cleary maintains that it was not necessary for his Honour to make specific reference to the Briginshaw standard.

 

73I accept that it was not necessary that his Honour articulate in his reasons the need to apply the Briginshaw standard and as an experienced judge it would be expected that he had done so. However, his Honour's conclusion that a verdict for Mr Beck must automatically follow from the finding on the ""no case"" application, coupled with the lack of any reference to the level of persuasion required by Briginshaw, suggests that his Honour did not at that stage turn his mind to any evidence (such as it was) that could be consistent with a genuine belief on the part of the police officers that Mr Beck had committed the offence with which he was being charged and that there was reasonable cause for him to be charged.

 

74It is submitted by Mr Cleary that the inference open to be drawn from the acceptance of Mr Beck's evidence was that, to the extent that the police statements were contradicted by Mr Beck's evidence, the police statements must have been false and Sergeant Sullivan must have known this. However, the giving of inconsistent or contradictory accounts does not of itself necessarily bespeak fabrication or dishonesty.

 

75His Honour does not appear to have addressed at all the possibility that there might have been an innocent explanation for the fact that evidence in the police statements that was contradicted by Mr Beck's evidence, notwithstanding that in another context his Honour was prepared to attribute an innocent explanation for discrepancies in the witness accounts (namely, the distance from the Oxford Street intersection where the incident occurred).

 

76As adverted to above, his Honour proceeded on the basis that if Mr Beck's evidence (and that of his witnesses) were to be accepted then it must automatically follow that the police officers' version of events was fabricated. That does not, in my opinion, necessarily follow. Some of the contradictory statements could readily be explicable by differences in perception of distance: such as whether Mr Beck was at the rear of the parked car or was standing; a metre or so further south at the B pillar behind the front passenger seat; others might be referable a question of imprecision in the wording - such as the stance of Mr Beck or angle of his body.

 

77The most stark disparity between evidence contained in the two police statements on the one hand and the evidence of Mr Beck and his witnesses (consistent with the statement of Inspector Dempsey) is that as to Mr Beck's state of sobriety or intoxication. However, intoxication was not an essential element of the offensive conduct charge. I accept that one would not expect experienced police officers to be mistaken as to the signs of intoxication. His Honour considered that they had lied on this issue in order to remove a basis for Mr Beck's excuse of reasonable necessity..

 

78Ultimately, with respect to his Honour, I cannot be satisfied that the Briginshaw standard was properly applied, having regard to the manner in which his Honour treated the conclusion reached on the ""no case"" application as determinative of liability on the malicious prosecution case.

 

79Mr Cleary submits that there has been no miscarriage of justice, since the police had the opportunity to be heard. I do not accept that submission. It is one thing to argue that the State is bound by the consequences of forensic decisions made in the course of running a trial, it is another to say that serious findings of criminal conduct should be made against individual police officers who have not in a practical sense had the opportunity to respond to such accusations, and where it is not apparent that his Honour took into account the possibility of human error on their part.

 

80Ground 7 is made out.

 

Grounds 8 and 9 - Factual findings

 

81The State challenges the making of the seven findings of fact identified in ground 8 of the notice of appeal. Reliance was placed in this regard on the statement in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 (per Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ at 503), to the effect that an appellate court may exercise its own discretion, in substitution for that of the trial judge, if the judge has acted upon a wrong principle, has allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the judge, has mistaken the facts or has not taken into account some material consideration.

 

82However, what is challenged by grounds 8 and 9 is not the exercise of a discretion but the process of fact finding itself. Therefore, what must be shown by the State (bearing in mind that the challenged findings cannot have been based on adverse findings of credit in respect of the police officers' statements as they were not cross-examined) is, as explained in Abalos v Australian Postal Commission (1990) 171 CLR 167 by McHugh J, that his Honour failed to use, or palpably misused, his advantage as trial judge in that his Honour's advantage in that regard could not be sufficient to explain or justify the relevant conclusion (noting the qualification placed on what was said in Fox v Percy [2003] HCA 22; (2003) 214 CLR 118 (at [27], [30]-[31] as to the duty of this Court on a rehearing of this kind).

 

Ground 8(i) - finding of fabrication of position of Mr Beck in the street and in respect of the parked car

 

83His Honour was satisfied that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas had fabricated ""not only the circumstances in which they first saw [Mr Beck] and what he was then doing but also his position in the street and in respect of the parked car"". Mr Neil submits that his Honour did not allow for the fact that the police could simply have been mistaken as to those matters, noting that his Honour was prepared to accept that Mr Beck's friends could simply have been mistaken in their evidence as to the distance Mr Beck was from Oxford Street. While an explanation for this may well be that his Honour had seen and heard the evidence of Mr Beck's friends in the witness box, it does illustrate that an inconsistency in recollections of the event is not necessarily an indication of fabrication of evidence.

 

What was the evidence as to the position of Mr Beck in the street and in respect of the parked car?

 

84The first police statement, prepared by Sergeant Sullivan on 26 September 2006 and signed by Sergeant Deas on 2 October 2006, (Blue 44) relevantly recorded that:

 

Sergeant Deas was driving the vehicle and turned left into Pelican Street. Immediately both Sergeants Sullivan and Deas observed a male person ... standing on the eastern footpath of Pelican Street with his penis exposed and urinating towards the gutter. There was a black Peugeot hatch back ... parked on the eastern side of Pelican Street and the male person was standing on the footpath adjacent to the rear near side of this vehicle and urinating towards the gutter.

 

There was no other vehicle parked on Pelican Street between Oxford Street and the location of this black Peugeot and the male person was in clear view of patrons walking on Oxford Street and also numerous patrons who were sitting in the Hungry Jacks premises which is located on the corner of Oxford and Pelican Streets.

 

85Sergeant Deas was driving the vehicle in question. His view of Mr Beck must therefore have been from the driver's seat of the car, turning left into Pelican Street. There was no dispute that there were no cars parked behind the Peugeot closer to the Oxford Street intersection. Hence, his view of Mr Beck would have been at an angle but not obstructed by other cars. Sergeant Sullivan's view, as the passenger, would necessarily have been a view straight down the eastern footpath of Pelican Street as the car turned the corner.

 

86Sergeant Deas' later statement (Blue 50 at [4]) recorded that ""immediately on turning into Pelican Street from Oxford Street"" he saw Mr Beck:

 

... standing on the Eastern footpath urinating into the gutter. He was adjacent to the rear of a black Peugeot Hatchback ... which was parked at the kerb. [Mr Beck] was angled toward Oxford Street and the Hungry Jacks restaurant on the opposite corner of Oxford and Pelican Street ...

 

87Sergeant Sullivan's later statement (Blue 53 at [6]-[8]) relevantly recorded that:

 

...We turned from Oxford Street into Pelican Street and I immediately saw [Mr Beck] standing on the eastern footpath with his penis exposed urinating in the gutter. [Mr Beck] was clearly visible from Oxford Street and Pelican Street.

 

[Mr Beck] was standing adjacent to the rear of a black Peugeot Hatchback ... which was parked on the eastern kerb of Pelican approximately fifteen metres south of the intersection of Oxford Street. 

 

[Mr Beck] had made no attempt to conceal himself as he urinated in the gutter and he was angled towards Oxford Street and the Hungry Jacks restaurant located on the opposite corner of Oxford and Pelican Streets.

 

88Both Sergeant Deas and Sergeant Sullivan recorded in their statements that Mr Beck was clearly visible whilst urinating (Deas at [9]; Sullivan at [9], where Sergeant Sullivan said that there was an unobstructed view of Mr Beck urinating with his penis clearly exposed ""as soon as we turned into Pelican Street""). Sergeant Sullivan noted in his statement that there was no other vehicle parked on Pelican Street between the rear of the black Peugeot and Oxford Street.

 

89Inspector Dempsey, who attended the scene shortly after but did not observe the incident, reported that the area where the incident occurred ""was only a very short distance from Oxford Street"" and to the incident having occurred directly opposite the Hungry Jack's restaurant (Blue 42S).

 

90In his response to the s 173(5) notice, Mr Beck had said that he had walked about 15 to 20 metres south of the Oxford Street intersection (Blue 190N) and that the parked car was ""about 20 metres south"" facing a southerly direction (Blue 191D). In that statement, Mr Beck said that he had ""stepped into the gutter"" and that his back was ""turned towards Oxford Street and four friends [were] slightly in front and opposite [him] and within [his] eyesight"" (Blue 191F). Mr Beck said that he had had an unobstructed view south (and that his right hand was holding onto food that he had purchased - a chicken kebab).

 

91Mr McHenry's affidavit deposed that he had crossed Pelican Street to the same side as Hungry Jacks ""opposite the Wig Shop about 15 metres south of Hungry Jacks"" and that he saw Mr Beck ""standing opposite us across the road behind a parked car ... facing [i.e. south down Pelican Street] the direction the car was facing and ... standing in the middle of the parked car, just behind the front passenger door (Blue 6 [7]-[8]). At Black 95N-P he said that Mr Beck's back was facing towards Oxford Street at the time of urination.

 

92Ms Shillitoe deposed to Mr Beck being ""on the opposite side of the road, about 15 metres from Oxford Street and Hungry Jacks"" and that he was ""standing in the middle, between the front of the car and the back of the car and facing the direction of the car"". She said she could see his head and shoulders (Blue 9 at [8]-[9]). At Black 78 she said she could ""only just sort of see his silhouette"". At Black 81C, she said that she could see that Mr Beck was facing her. In her affidavit, Ms Shillitoe had said that she saw Mr Beck ""standing behind a car on the kerb"". At Black 81L, she clarified that to say that he would have been ""in the middle of the car"", and that ""he was standing on the pavement behind the car to the middle of the car to what my presumption was [sic] that he was standing in the middle of the kerb"".

 

93Mr Saba deposed that Mr Beck had ""fallen behind slightly""; that they had walked about 20 metres from Oxford Street south and that he turned and saw someone ""standing opposite us across the road, behind a parked car"". He said he could see the man's head and shoulders, that the man ""was facing south and his back was to Oxford Street, he was about halfway between the front of this car and the rear of this car eating a chicken kebab skewer"" (Blue 98 [9]-[10]). He said that he could not see what the man was doing (other, it seems, than eating a chicken kebab skewer) from where he was standing. At Black 102H, he agreed that Mr Beck was looking in the direction of the street in which his car was parked then said he was ""look[ing] straight at us"" and went on to say that he could clearly see Mr Beck holding a chicken kebab in his mouth.

 

94Mr Beck's affidavit evidence was that, although he had previously estimated that his location was approximately 20 metres south of Oxford Street, he had since measured the distance. He said that he had stopped opposite the Wig Ship on the eastern side of Pelican Street 38 metres south of Oxford Street facing in a southerly direction. He said that he had stepped off the footpath into the gutter and stood next to a black Peugeot hatch back adjacent to the B pillar of the car (that being located behind the front doors and separating the front from the rear doors). He said he was facing south and his back was facing Oxford Street.

 

95At [12]-[15] of his Honour's reasons, his Honour summarised the evidence of the three persons who had been with Mr Beck and had given evidence in his case. His Honour accepted Mr Beck's evidence as to the distance he was from Oxford Street, stating that the estimation of distances was difficult and that he was satisfied that the lesser distances to which Mr Beck's three friends had deposed were mistaken ([16]). When referring to the evidence as to Mr Beck's position in the street and in relation to the car, his Honour noted that the three other witnesses had been taken to photographs of the scene and when this was done their evidence supported the distance of 38 metres to which Mr Beck had deposed.

 

96His Honour (at [32]) then said that, if Mr Beck and the other witnesses told the truth, Sergeant Sullivan's account constituted ""an elaborate, deliberately false fabrication"". His Honour said:

 

There is simply no room for mistake or misunderstanding. Leaving aside the plaintiff's position vis-à-vis the parked car, he was significantly further down Pelican Street than 15 metres, and was facing away from both Oxford and Hungry Jack's which was behind him to his right. It follows from these facts alone that it was impossible for Sergeant Sullivan to have seen the plaintiff's penis when the police vehicle turned the corner and also impossible for the patrons of Hungry Jack's to have done so at any time, as Sergeant Sullivan must have appreciated. (my emphasis)

 

97In fact, Mr Beck himself had initially estimated the distance at around fifteen metres. Therefore, if his later measurement of the scene was correct, as his Honour accepted it was, everyone present on the night who had expressed an opinion as to distance was mistaken. Again, this indicates that an incorrect assertion as to distance is not necessarily an indication of deliberate fabrication of evidence.

 

98As to Mr Beck's position in relation to the car, with no parked car behind the Peugeot, differences between the witnesses and the police as to whether Mr Beck was standing at the rear or adjacent to the rear or adjacent to the B pillar could readily be explicable to one or other of the witnesses or the police simply being mistaken as to the distance Mr Beck was at or the position where he stood vis-à-vis the car without anyone having necessarily fabricated his or her evidence.

 

99There is a clear inconsistency between the statements on the one hand that Mr Beck's back was turned towards Oxford Street and that he was facing down Pelican Street in the direction the Peugeot was facing and the police version that he was angled towards Hungry Jack's. However, given the evidence of Ms Shillitoe and Mr Saba, it seems that at least his head and shoulders may have been angled towards the western side of the street, which suggests the possibility that Mr Beck's body may have been angled to some degree in that direction.

 

100His Honour went on to say:

 

The plaintiff was not at the rear of the parked car, but in the centre of the cabin, which must necessarily have concealed him below the waist from any patron of Hungry Jack's, not to speak of the police.

 

101After referring to (and implicitly accepting) Mr Beck's evidence that his penis was already in his underpants when the police car stopped, his Honour concluded that the police officers did not see Mr Beck's penis at any time.

 

102In circumstances where all the witnesses (including Mr Beck) and the police had initially estimated the distance at somewhere between 15-20m from Oxford Street, there is no basis for a finding that the police fabricated their evidence as to distance. As to the angle at which Mr Beck was standing, accepting the evidence of Mr Beck's witnesses at least the upper part of his body seems to have been angled towards the opposite side of Pelican Street (for him to be looking straight at his friends across the road and for the chicken kebab to be visible in his mouth, as Mr Saba said) and hence might explain a description of Mr Beck as angled at least partly towards Hungry Jack's.

 

103The position of Mr Beck vis-à-vis the car is by no means conclusive of fabrication on the part of the police, since there was no car parked behind the Peugeot and on any view Mr Beck was towards the rear of the car and standing in the gutter (though Ms Shillitoe at one stage seemed to suggest he was not in the gutter but on the kerb).

 

104As to the opinion, expressed in the police statements, that Mr Beck was clearly visible to patrons in the Hungry Jack's restaurant, there was no consideration seemingly given by his Honour to the possibility that, again, this was an error of judgment - i.e., that the police officers mistakenly believed that to be the case having regard to what they had themselves seen. (A similar explanation might perhaps have been available for the evidence as to Mr Beck's penis being exposed - namely, that they saw him urinating or thought he was urinating, and assumed that what they were seeing was his penis rather than, say, his hand covering it or attempting to do up his fly - although that would not explain the discrepancy between the different versions as to whether he continued to urinate after the police car stopped; and in any event no such explanation was proffered in the absence of oral evidence of the police officers.)

 

105Therefore, while it was certainly open to his Honour to accept the evidence of Mr Beck and his witnesses as to Mr Beck's position in the street and vis-à-vis the car, the finding of deliberate fabrication as a necessary result of acceptance of their evidence, seems to me to bespeak a misuse of the advantage his Honour enjoyed as the trial judge.

 

Ground 8(ii) - fabrication as to lighting

 

106At [46], his Honour said that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas:

 

... also lied about the light, whether from street lighting or Hungry Jacks, at the place where the plaintiff was standing.""

 

107Sergeant Sullivan's statement (at [23]) was that ""[t]he area where [Mr Beck] had his penis exposed urinating is illuminated by street lighting along with lighting from business and high rise residential premises in the immediate vicinity"" (Blue 56M). Sergeant Deas similarly said (at [9]) that ""[t]he area is illuminated by street lighting along with the lighting from business and high rise residential premises in the immediate vicinity"". (Blue 52G). Inspector Dempsey's report, highly relevant in that he was not the subject of his Honour's criticism or any findings of fabrication and he had also attended the scene, was that the area where the incident occurred was ""well lit"" (Blue 42S).

 

108Mr McHenry gave no evidence in his affidavit about the light but said that he could not see what Mr Beck was doing from where he was standing. He said in the witness box that: it was dark and there was not a lot of street lighting (Black 84T); that there was light from Hungry Jack's but there ""wasn't a lot of illumination"" from Hungry Jack's where they (presumably there not referring to Mr Beck who was opposite) were standing; there was not a lot of lighting from houses or apartments (Black 84X); that it ""wasn't too dark to see him"" (Black 93P), but thought that was also because he knew what he was wearing; agreed with his Honour that he could make out Mr Beck's features as distinct from some sort of generally shadowy form (Black 93U); and then said, again, (at Black 95O) that it was dark, when explaining why he was shocked later to find out that Mr Beck had been in trouble because he was urinating in the street.

 

109Ms Shillitoe said it was ""very dark"" (Black 775); accepted that there would have been lights coming from Hungry Jack's (Black 77T); said it was not light where she was standing (Black 78G); and she did not recall any light at all where Mr Beck was standing (Black 78G). She did not recall if she had been able to see Mr Beck's features.

 

110Mr Saba said (at Black 97) that it was pretty dark and there was not much lighting (Black 97T), not that it was pitch black but that there ""wasn't much light"" (Black 109T). Mr Saba could nevertheless see sufficiently well to describe Mr Beck as having the chicken kebab in his mouth though he said it was not light enough to see a person's features.

 

111Mr Neil submits that photographs tendered by Mr Beck show that there was a light pole near where Mr Beck claimed to be standing and two other lights on the opposite side not far from Hungry Jack's.

 

112Relevantly, neither Sergeant Sullivan nor Sergeant Deas referred in their statements to the light from Hungry Jack's and there was no suggestion of fabrication by Inspector Dempsey. In light of that, the ability of at least Mr Saba to see a chicken kebab in Mr Beck's mouth and the variety of the descriptions of the area and lighting where Mr Beck was standing, it is difficult to see how a finding of fabrication could have been made on this issue applying the Briginshaw standard.

 

Grounds 8(iii)-(v) - fabrication as to use of toilet facilities at Hungry Jack's, Sydney Police Centre or public toilets in the vicinity

 

113After the abovementioned extracts from [46], and after a statement as to the evidence of Mr Beck's sobriety and demeanour (to which I refer later), his Honour went on to say:

 

I do not accept, either, that the toilet facilities at Hungry Jack's were available simply to members of the public, as distinct from patrons, or that the plaintiff would have been able to use the toilets at the Sydney Police Centre or that there was any other public toilet available to him in the near vicinity.

 

114At the outset, it is not clear to me that his Honour was here making a finding that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas had fabricated any evidence as to this issue, although I accept that the word ""either"" suggests that his Honour was treating the rejection of the propositions that followed as being in the same category as his findings of fabrication that preceded them.

 

115Certainly, there was nothing in the police statements positively asserting as fact any of the propositions that his Honour stated, in the extract at [113] above, that he did not accept. Rather, what Sergeant Sullivan records in his statement is that he put to Mr Beck the proposition that he could have used toilet facilities (either across the road at Hungry Jack's or at the Sydney Police Centre) (Blue 55C-K). Mr Beck's response to those propositions was, in effect, that he was intoxicated; that the last time he went to Hungry Jack's the toilets were really dirty; and that he could not get into the Sydney Police Centre without a warrant card and would not go there anyway (Blue 55D). In Mr Beck's response to the s 173(5) notice he said that when the police asked him about Hungry Jack's he had said that ""[t]he last time I was there the toilets were closed, at Kings Cross they nailed the toilet door shut.""

 

116Mr Neil submits that the proposition that Mr Beck could have gone across the road to Hungry Jack's was a reasonable assumption but that in any event there was no evidence in the statements by Sergeants Sullivan and Deas to support the proposition that they falsely advanced a positive proposition that toilets were available at Hungry Jack's to persons in the position of Mr Beck; nor was there any assertion in the police statements that the toilets were available for use by Mr Beck at the Sydney Police Centre. As to the proposition that the police statements asserted that there were other public toilets available to Mr Beck in the near vicinity, he notes that Sergeant Sullivan recorded no more than a question by Sergeant Deas as to why he had not gone around the corner.

 

117If this was indeed a finding of fabrication (and I doubt it was), there was in my view no basis for it to be made.

 

Ground 8(vi) - fabrication as to state of Mr Beck's sobriety and demeanour

 

118Also at [46], his Honour expressed the view, that he said was supported by the evidence of Inspector Dempsey, that Sergeants Sullivan and Deas had ""lied about the plaintiff's sobriety (probably to remove one of the reasons for not going to the SPC)"". As to the parenthetical comment, Mr Neil submits that this was no more than speculation without any evidentiary basis. I agree. Moreover, Mr Beck's explanation that he did not have his warrant card with him (and could therefore would not have gained entry to the SPC) would have ruled out the possibility that he could have gone to the SPC anyway, so there would have been no logical reason for Sergeant Sullivan to have lied about Mr Beck's sobriety for the reason his Honour speculated.

 

119Leaving aside his Honour's speculation as to why the police officers would have lied about Mr Beck's sobriety, this is the one aspect of the police officers' statements that in my view could support an inference that they had fabricated evidence. It is difficult to postulate a scenario where Sergeants Deas and Sullivan could have been mistaken in the descriptions they gave as to Mr Beck's condition, when compared with Inspector Dempsey's account and the evidence of the three friends, unless Mr Beck had been able, at least for a short time, to present himself to them as a relatively sober individual.

 

120However, given the other findings of fabrication where I consider his Honour misused his advantage as a trial judge, the troublesome evidence of sobriety does not remove my concern as to the overall conclusion of fabrication.

 

121At [47], his Honour added that he did not accept that the account of Sergeant Sullivan (nor that of Sergeant Deas to the extent that it corroborated it) was truthful in respect of those parts in which it differed from that given by Mr Beck. His Honour went on to say that:

 

Moreover, even if it were accepted, it certainly does not demonstrate that the plaintiff was ""rude, abrupt, dismissive of his actions [with] no respect for rank"". ... As I said above, their characterisation of the nature conversation [sic] was itself manufactured.

 

122In that regard, however, Inspector Dempsey's statement recorded a similar assessment of Mr Beck, namely that ""[h]is demeanour was initially arrogant and flippant however when further spoken to he became more rational and understood to some extent that his actions would bring serious consequences"" (Blue 42O).

 

123In the absence of any basis for suggesting that Inspector Dempsey had fabricated his evidence, there is no basis for concluding that Sergeants Deas and Sullivan were not truthful in their view as to Mr Beck's demeanour simply because his Honour formed a different view as to whether Mr Beck's account of events portrayed him in a bad light in this regard.

 

Ground 8(vii)- fabrication as to which way Mr Beck was facing

 

124This has been considered in relation to ground 8(i) above. Mr Neil submits that his Honour failed to take into account the material favourable to the police's version of events in relation to where Mr Beck was facing when first seen by them. I consider that submission to be well founded. Mr Neil also submits that on Mr Beck's version of events there was no reason for the police to stop and speak to him, which is inconsistent with the fact that they did so immediately after turning into the street and observing him. It is not necessary to speculate on why the police officers chose to stop and speak to Mr Beck.

 

Conclusion as to grounds 8 and 9

 

125I consider that grounds 8(i), (ii) and (vi) (but only in relation to demeanour), and the corresponding grounds in 9, have been made out.

 

Ground 10 - Damages

 

126This issue does not strictly arise as in my opinion the State has succeeded on its appeal as to liability. However, I consider its appeal as to quantum below.

 

127At [48] to [66], his Honour summarised the evidence as to the impact of the malicious prosecution on Mr Beck's reputation and career as a police constable. Mr Cleary notes that this was not challenged. His Honour then referred to the principles set out in NSW v Zreika [2012] NSWCA 37. His Honour concluded that the response of Sergeants Sullivan and Deas, in considering whether a criminal prosecution should have been commenced, was ""woefully inadequate"". In so doing, however, his Honour appears to have had regard to what was done by other police officers in response to the s 173(5) notice, which post-dated by some months both the decision to institute proceedings and the withdrawal of the charges.

 

128His Honour awarded exemplary damages in the amount of $80,000. As already noted, the amount of general damages that was awarded was $50,000. Mr Neil submits that the award of exemplary damages was manifestly excessive even if his Honour's findings against the police were to be accepted.

 

129Mr Neil notes that in Zreika the police had acted in a way that resulted in the plaintiff being incarcerated for a lengthy period of time and an award of exemplary damages of $100,000 was reduced on appeal to $50,000. He also points to the outcomes in NSW v Deify [2007] NSWCA 303, where an award of exemplary damages of $25,000 was reduced on appeal to $10,000, and in Zaravinos v NSW (2004) 62 NSWLR 58, where an award of $25,000 was considered to be a ""not inconsiderable"" sum to cover all classes of damages.

 

130Mr Cleary submits that the award of damages was not excessive. He accepts that the reasoning that led to the exemplary damages award included not only that the conduct of Sergeants Sullivan and Deas was serious and involved criminal offences ([68]) but also that there was no attempt made by Sergeant Sullivan to interview Mr Beck or his friends in relation to the incident prior to instituting proceedings. However, his Honour goes on to refer to the fact that no investigation was undertaken by Superintendent Crandell, notwithstanding the serious consequences for a criminal prosecution of Mr Beck. Superintendent Crandell's conduct cannot be relevant to the issue as to whether the proceedings were maliciously commenced or maintained.

 

131What appears to be argued in that regard is that ""failures"" or ""inadequacy"" in the subsequent investigation of the complaints should be taken into account in punishing misconduct that occurred at an earlier time. This illustrates the separateness of the conduct of Superintendent Crandell from that of the prosecuting officer. That conduct, in my opinion was not a relevant consideration to take into account even if the implicit criticism of Superintendent Crandell were warranted (which, for reasons I set out below, it is not).

 

132If the findings of fabrication were to stand, exemplary damages should certainly be ordered to mark disapproval of the conduct of the police officers in fabricating the evidence that led to the claim. The question is whether his Honour's discretion miscarried in the sense that he took into account the conduct of Superintendent Crandell in determining what level of damages should be ordered. In my opinion, it did. I am not satisfied that this was a relevant consideration.

 

133Mr Cleary accepted that the criticism that was made by his Honour in relation to the investigation seemed to suggest that the award for exemplary damages was in part to reflect a need for training and discipline for past abuses. The proposition thus put in support of the exemplary damages award was to the following effect. First, that his Honour's reasoning (at [69]) should be understood as being that there was such blatant misconduct in fabricating evidence in the context of the malicious prosecution case that an award of exemplary damages was required in order to punish and deter future such conduct. Second, that his Honour was fortified in the view that it was necessary so to punish and deter that conduct with an award of that amount because his Honour considered that in a subsequent investigation arising out of those facts there had not been a proper investigation of the matters that had been raised by Mr Beck.

 

134However, such a formulation emphasises the separateness of the two events and the two courses of conduct. Apart from the fact that I see nothing inappropriate in the Superintendent approaching the task then before him (of determining whether the recommended reduction in rank should be approved) on the basis that Mr Beck's evidence be accepted at its highest, the award of exemplary damages was to mark the Court's disapproval and censure of quite different conduct.

 

135In my opinion, his Honour therefore took into account an irrelevant consideration in the making of the award. Having regard to the authorities to which this Court was taken, and in particular Zreika, I consider that an award of $40,000 would have been justified by way of exemplary damages, bearing in mind that Mr Beck was not arrested or incarcerated but also that the purpose of exemplary damages is to express condemnation of the actions of the police officers who on this hypothesis would be found to have committed criminal offences in connection with the charges brought against Mr Beck.

 

Conclusion

 

136I consider that the appeal should be allowed and the matter remitted for hearing.

 

137Rule 51.53 requires Court not to remit for new trial unless substantial injustice would result. The allegations made by Mr Beck about the conduct of the police were very serious. It is in my view in the public interest that they be properly determined and hence that there would be substantial injustice if the appeal were not to be remitted.

 

Prerogative relief proceedings

 

138In the second set of proceedings, the Commissioner seeks leave to appeal from the decision by his Honour quashing the decision made by Superintendent Crandell on 22 September 2008. The Commissioner seeks to appeal from this decision on the grounds that his Honour erred:

 

(i) in finding that the decision made by Superintendent Crandell on 22 September 2008 was manifestly unreasonable;

(ii) in the test that his Honour applied to the question whether there was an offence; and

(iii) in finding that the section 173(5) notice did not include the nature of the proposed order.

 

139The second appeal ground in the draft notice of appeal was not pressed.

 

Should leave to appeal be granted

 

140The Commissioner requires leave to appeal the decision quashing the 22 September 2008 decision of Superintendent Crandell by reason of s 101 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). Grant of leave is opposed by Mr Beck on the ground that the Commissioner has not provided substantial reasons for appellate review (referring to what was said in Johnson Tiles Pty Ltd v Esso Australia Ltd (2000) 104 FCR 564 as to when it is appropriate for leave to appeal to be granted - there, in respect of an interlocutory decision).

 

141The Commissioner contends that leave should be granted in this case as the proposed appeal raises an issue of legal and public importance involving the conduct of the processes of the NSW Police Force. The issue so identified is whether the test when making a decision under s 173 is whether an actual offence has been committed (as it is contended was the thrust of his Honour's decision) or whether (as the Commissioner contends) the test is whether the conduct could reasonably be thought by the decision-maker to come within the category of misconduct.

 

142I consider that the appeal sought to be maintained by the Commissioner does raise an issue in the public interest and that leave to appeal should be granted.

 

Decision by the primary judge

 

143In the prerogative relief proceedings, Mr Beck relied upon an affidavit sworn by him on 30 July 2010 (Blue 101). The Commissioner relied upon affidavits of each of Superintendent Hayes and Superintendent Crandell (the respective decision makers).

 

144His Honour considered (at [79]-[81]) the decision made by Superintendent Crandell on 22 September 2008. His Honour concluded that it should be quashed on the ground it was a manifestly unreasonable decision.

 

145At [79], his Honour criticised the content of the notice in that he said that the notice could scarcely be said to have identified the misconduct or unsatisfactory performance (including all relevant facts and circumstances) on the basis of which the proposed order was intended to be made (s 173(5)(a)) if the basis for the allegations in the notice (i.e., the statements made by the relevant police officers) was not disclosed.

 

146At [80], his Honour said that more fundamental was the character of Superintendent Crandell's conclusion as to the conduct of Mr Beck. His Honour said:

 

If the plaintiff's position was as he and his witnesses described it, it was impossible that any person whether in the restaurant or otherwise could have seen his person and, although they might have guessed that he was urinating, they could not have known that this was the fact. There was no basis ... without actually determining which of the conflicting accounts was the truth - a task which, manifestly, the Superintendent did not undertake - for acting otherwise than accepting that the plaintiff had attempted to conceal himself and had succeeded in doing so in a situation where he had to relieve himself then and there. No reasonable person would have taken any offence at what the plaintiff had done. No reasonable decision maker could have concluded otherwise. Moreover, it was also unreasonable in this sense to conclude that, on the plaintiff's account, his conduct was ""highly likely ...[to amount to] a criminal offence"". Quite apart from this, it seems to me that the finding that the plaintiff's conduct was so ""seriously inappropriate and unacceptable"" and deserved the adverse consequences specified in the order was so manifestly unreasonable as to have vitiated the exercise of the statutory discretion proposed [sic] in the Superintendent. 

 

Appeal

 

147The jurisdiction being exercised by his Honour when reviewing the decision made by Superintendent Crandell was a supervisory jurisdiction. Mr Beck had sought relief under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 against the Commissioner of Police in the nature of certiorari.

 

148Mr Beck contended that the decision was infected by jurisdictional error in that the decision made by Superintendent Crandell was so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have come to the same conclusion, invoking the so-called Wednesbury test of unreasonableness (derived from Associated Provincial Picture House Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation [1948] 1 KB 223 at 229-233).

 

149In Associated Provincial Picture Houses, Limited v Wednesbury Corporation, Lord Greene MR said at 230:

 

It is true to say that, if a decision on a competent matter is so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it, then the courts can interfere ...; but to prove a case of that kind would require something overwhelming.

 

150The question to be determined by his Honour was thus whether the 22 September decision was one that was ""illogical, irrational or lacking a basis in findings or inferences of fact supported by logical grounds"", to adopt the words of Spigelman CJ in Murrumbidgee Groundwater Preservation Association Inc v Minister for Natural Resources [2005] NSWCA 10, (2005) 138 LGERA 11 at [129] (with whom Beazley JA, as her Honour then was, and Tobias JA agreed). See also Westfleld Management Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Co Ltd [2006] NSWCA 245 at [71] and Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v SZMDS [2010] HCA 16; (2010) 240 CLR 611 at [121]-[131], and [135].

 

151In Marrickville Metro Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Marrickville Council [2010] NSWCA 145 at [104]-[109], Tobias JA noted the distinction between what the Court considered was unreasonable and a decision that the Court considered was so unreasonable that no reasonable body could have come to it, concluding that the relevant unreasonableness in the decision must be something shown to be irrational, absurd or implausible.

 

(i) Ground 1- error in finding the decision manifestly unreasonable

 

152Section 173 of the Police Act provides that the Commissioner may take action with respect to a police officer's misconduct or unsatisfactory performance.

 

153Mr Neil submits that, in reviewing the decision made by Superintendent Crandell, his Honour did not correctly apply the Wednesbury test but, rather, impermissibly proceeded to review the decision on the merits (citing Minister for Aboriginal Affairs v Peko-Wallsend Ltd [1986] HCA 40; (1986) 162 CLR 24 at 42). In Minister for Immigration and Citizenship v Li [2013] HCA 18 Hayne, Kiefel and Bell JJ noted (at [66]) that there is an area in which the decision maker has a genuine and free discretion which resides within the bounds of legal reasonableness and indicated that courts should be conscious of not exceeding their supervisory role by undertaking a review of the merits of an exercise of discretionary power.

 

154At [72] in Li, their Honours refer to the concept of ""manifestly unreasonable"" as where a decision maker may be regarded, by reference to the scope and purpose of the statute, as having committed a particular error in reasoning, given disproportionate weight to some factor or reasoned irrationally or illogically.

 

155Mr Neil submits, and I accept, that the conclusion that Mr Beck's conduct was ""seriously inappropriate and unacceptable"" (and capable of amounting to a s 4(1) offence at least at a prima facie level) was not unreasonable.

 

156Mr Cleary argues that, critical to his Honour's conclusion that Superintendent Crandell's decision was manifestly unreasonable, were his Honour's findings as to the evidence contained in the statements of Mr Beck and the three witnesses called by him as to Mr Beck's conduct and the conclusion reached by his Honour that this evidence could not support any finding that Mr Beck had either acted in an offensive manner or had committed any offence under s 4(1) of the Summary Offences Act 1988. Mr Cleary points to his Honour's conclusion (at [26]) that, on Mr Beck's account of events, Mr Beck had committed no offence (as I understand it, on the basis that, if no one was capable of seeing his penis while he was urinating, no one could reasonably have considered that this was offensive conduct). He further contends that if, as Mr Beck said he was, Mr Beck was unable to prevent himself from urinating then the defence of reasonable necessity would apply such that he would have committed no criminal offence.

 

157However, as Mr Neil points out, the notice under s 173(5) raised matters of alleged misconduct in light of the Police Code of Conduct. This was not an inquiry as to whether an offence had occurred. Superintendent Crandell proceeded in my view appropriately in considering whether there had been misconduct on the basis of an assumption that Mr Beck's own version of the relevant events were to be accepted.

 

158It is submitted by Mr Neil that, on Mr Beck's version of events, had there been a bystander or pedestrian on the eastern side of Pelican Street at the relevant time that person would have seen an intoxicated man urinating in the street covering his penis with his left hand whilst holding a kebab with his other hand and that it was not manifestly unreasonable for Superintendent Crandell to consider that such a bystander or pedestrian would or could be offended. Furthermore, it is submitted by Mr Neil that even if, on Mr Beck's version of events, his conduct did not constitute an offence, an opinion by Superintendent Crandell that it was highly likely that it did would not vitiate his decision that Mr Beck's conduct was seriously unacceptable and inappropriate conduct for an off-duty police officer. I agree.

 

159It could not in my view be said to be manifestly unreasonable for Superintendent Crandell to come to the view that, on Mr Beck's own version of events, Mr Beck's conduct was ""seriously inappropriate and unacceptable"" and did not comply with the spirit of the Police Code of Conduct.

 

160Mr Neil also submits that his Honour erred in taking into account the oral evidence of Ms Shillitoe, Mr Saba and Mr McHenry at the hearing, in determining whether the Superintendent's decision was vitiated. He submits that this evidence was irrelevant, not being something that was before Superintendent Crandell. It is not necessary in light of the conclusion I have reach above to consider this additional submission. However, I accept that the reasonableness or unreasonableness of a decision can only be based on the material before the relevant decision maker or to which the decision maker should and would be able to have had regard.

 

161In the present case, Superintendent Crandell in effect applied the ""no case"" to answer test. He considered Mr Beck's version of events at its highest. There was no unreasonableness in so doing. Whether he reached the conclusion that his Honour would have done is not the test. The conclusion that Superintendent Crandell reached was one that in my opinion was open to him even accepting, as Mr Cleary emphasised, that Mr Beck's belief was that he acted out of reasonable necessity.

 

(ii) Ground 3 - correct test for offence under s 4(1) Summary Offences Act

 

162The second ground pressed on this appeal is as to whether his Honour erred in the test applied to the question of whether there was an offence in respect of s 4 of the Summary Offences Act 1988 (NSW), which prohibits a person from conducting himself or herself ""in an offensive manner in or near, or within view or hearing from, a public place"".

 

163At [21] to [25], his Honour referred to R v Smith [1974] 2 NSWLR 586, Stutsel v Reid (1990) 20 NSWLR 661 and R v Benson (1882) 8 VLR (L) 2 to the effect that it is not necessary that some person should have seen the conduct. At [23], his Honour noted that the focus is ""on the anticipated response of the reasonable person who might have witnessed the conduct in question"".

 

164His Honour then referred to the statement by Sully J in Spence v Loguch (unreported, 12 November 1991 at p 10), where his Honour cited with approval Inglis v Fish [1961] VR 607 (at 611 [25]- [30]):

 

It is not necessary that the case for the prosecution must contain, in order to establish a prima facie case of an offence, evidence that some such reasonable person was in fact offended. It is sufficient that ... such behaviour occurred in a place where the presence of members of the public might reasonably have been anticipated; and in such circumstances where such behaviour could be seen by any member of the public who happened to be present if he were looking...

 

165In Inglis, Pape J had said that behaviour can be offensive ""notwithstanding that no member of the public is present, or (if there be members of the public present) that nobody is offended, provided such behaviour occurred in a place where the presence of members of the public might reasonably have been anticipated; and in circumstances where such behaviour could be seen by any member of the public who happened to be present if he were looking"" (at 611.25-30) (my emphasis).

 

166It is submitted by Mr Neil that this is a reference to an ""hypothetical person""; i.e., the hypothetical ordinary reasonable person. I agree.

 

167At [26], his Honour said:

 

On the facts here, (putting aside the contrary evidence of the police sergeants) it is clear that there was no person at all in the vicinity who was capable of seeing what the plaintiff was doing. It follows that, on the plaintiffs account, he had committed no offence. (my emphasis)

 

168It is submitted by Mr Neil that it is implicit in the above that his Honour found that Mr Beck's version of events was not capable of amounting to an offence because there was no one there present (i.e., no one in Pelican or Oxford Street at the relevant time) who was capable of seeing what Mr Beck was doing and that it was because of this that there was no prima facie case against Mr Beck.

 

169Mr Neil does not suggest that his Honour did not state the correct test as to what was required for a contravention of s 4(1); rather, it is contended that his Honour failed to apply that test.

 

170The conclusion by his Honour, in the way expressed by him, does in my view incorrectly focus on whether there was anyone physically present in the street at the time who could reasonably have been offended at the conduct. As I understand Inglis and Spence, the relevant question would be whether, if there had been an ordinary reasonable person in the street at the relevant time (the hypothetical ordinary reasonable person), that person could have seen and been offended by Mr Beck's conduct. Mr Cleary submits that on Mr Beck's evidence the answer to this would be in the negative, since Mr Beck said that he had concealed his penis while urinating. But whether it was concealed or not the hypothetical ordinary reasonable person could reasonably have been offended by the act of urination in the street. The challenge to his Honour's reasons in this respect is that his Honour misapplied the hypothetical person test. I consider that criticism to be made out.

 

171Although nothing turns in practical terms on this challenge to his Honour's reasons, since the relevant issue is whether the decision of Superintendent Crandell was one that no reasonable decision-maker could have made, applying the Wednesbury test of unreasonableness as understood in the authorities referred to above, in my opinion, this ground is made out.

 

(iii) Ground 4 - content of notice

 

172At [56], his Honour commented that the s 173(5) notice issued on 30 January 2008 did not inform Mr Beck of ""the proposed nature of the order"", except that it would be made under s 173(5). His Honour said that he would deal with the ""obvious unfairness"" of that omission in connection with the proceedings for prerogative relief.

 

173Nothing seems to have turned on this criticism of the s 173(5) notice when his Honour came to determine that the decision made by Superintendent Crandell on 22 September 2008 should be quashed (rather, what was there the subject of criticism, at [79], was whether the notice had identified all the relevant facts and circumstances on the basis of which it was intended to make the proposed order). Nevertheless, Mr Neil contends that the notice (at Blue 136-138) did adequately set out the nature of the proposed order, in that it stated that:

 

In accordance with section 173(5), Police Act 1990, I hereby give you notice that I am considering making a reviewable order against you in the following terms.

 

That pursuant to section 173(2)(a), Police Act 1990, that you be reduced in increment from Constable Level 5 to Constable Level 3.

 

174There can be no doubt that the nature of the order that Superintendent Murdoch (who had issued the notice) was considering had been identified in the notice issued to Mr Beck. However, in circumstances where his Honour does not appear to have taken that into account when determining to quash the September 2008 decision, the fact that the statement by his Honour at [56] was incorrect does not take matters any further.

 

175Insofar as his Honour was critical of the fact that the 30 January 2008 notice did not disclose the ""the basis for the allegations in the notice"" because it had not disclosed the statements made by the relevant police officers, this suggests that a notice under s 173(5) must refer to the evidence of the relevant facts and circumstances on which the allegation of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance is based and that a statement of the facts and circumstances said to amount to misconduct or unsatisfactory performance is not sufficient. I disagree.

 

176The s 173(5) notice summarised the assertions of the relevant police officers that they had observed Mr Beck ""whilst off duty standing on the footpath with your penis clearly exposed urinating in the gutter whilst facing Hungry Jacks Restaurant""; the opinion of the police officers that the patrons of Hungry Jack's would have had a clear view of his actions; and that Sergeant Sullivan's evidence suggested that Mr Beck had made no attempt to conceal himself while spoken to by the police officers and continued to urinate during the verbal exchange. It also referred to the allegation by both Sergeant Sullivan and Inspector Dempsey that Mr Beck had behaved in a rude, unprofessional and uncooperative manner throughout the incident and subsequent events; and quoted statements made by Sergeant Sullivan in that regard.

 

177The notice expressed Superintendent Murdoch's concern both that there were grounds to conclude that Mr Beck had behaved in ""an unacceptable and potentially illegal and obscene manner, by urinating in a public place with [his] penis exposed"" and as to the lack of remorse or contrition, or recognition of wrongdoing, that Superintendent Murdoch said appeared to have been demonstrated by Mr Beck's ""alleged attitude towards other police officers"".

 

178The notice then quoted extracts from the New South Wales Police Code of Conduct and Ethics as to Private Conduct and as to Statement of Values, to which I have already referred.

 

179While it is true that Mr Beck was not provided at that time with copies of the statements that had been made by the relevant police officers, he had in my opinion been adequately notified of the facts and circumstances on which Superintendent Murdoch stated that he was considering making the order to reduce Mr Beck's increment as constable.

 

180Mr Neil notes that Mr Beck provided a detailed and extensive response to the notice and submits that there was no unfairness to Mr Beck even if the notice was not adequate. It is not necessary to determine this since there was no challenge based on procedural unfairness to Mr Beck.

 

181Mr Cleary submits that the fact that the notice, while identifying the allegations and the proposed order, did not set out or contain the relevant statements said to support the allegations was a legal error (namely, a failure to comply strictly with the terms of s 173(5) of the Police Act) and that s 173(5) is a provision that provides police officers with procedural fairness (referring, by analogy, to the decision of the High Court in relation to procedural fairness provisions in the Migration Act 1958 (Cth) in SAAP v MIMIA [2005] HCA 24; (2005) 228 CLR 294).

 

182Whether or not Mr Beck may have had a basis to complain of procedural unfairness in the manner in which he was notified of the relevant facts and circumstances on the basis of which the order referred to in the s 173(5) notice was being considered, it is clear from his Honour's reasons that what was fundamental to his Honour's decision to quash the notice was ""the character of Superintendent Crandell's conclusion as to the plaintiff's conduct"" and that there was no basis, without Superintendent Crandell actually determining which of the conflicting accounts was the truth, for Superintendent Crandell to act otherwise than to accept that Mr Beck ""had attempted to conceal himself and had succeeded in doing so in a situation where he had to relieve himself then and there"". His Honour concluded on the basis of those matters that no reasonable person would have taken any offence at what Mr Beck had done and no reasonable decision maker could have concluded otherwise (at [80]).

 

183I consider the notice adequately sets out the allegations made against Mr Beck and that, to the extent that his Honour found otherwise, Ground 4 is made out.

184I would grant leave and allow the appeal.

		11 September 2015",2013-12-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2705747,Col v R [2013] NSWCCA 302,"Judgment
1LATHAM J : The appellant, Murat Col, appeals against his conviction after a trial before Lakatos SC DCJ in August 2011 with respect to the offence of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm pursuant to s 33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1990.  There is no appeal against sentence.
The Crown Case
2At the time of the offence, the appellant was 40 years of age and lived with his de facto partner, Maryanne Scott, who was the victim of the offence.  The circumstances of the offence summarised below derives substantially from a statement provided by the victim to police but retracted shortly before the appellant's trial.
3On 7 August 2009, the appellant attended an evening barbeque.  At around 8:30 pm the victim called the appellant on his mobile phone, becoming upset because she had expected the appellant to be home by that time.  Later on, the appellant tried to call the victim several times but the victim did not answer the phone.
4The appellant returned home at approximately 10 pm.  The victim accused him of lying about the presence of women at the barbeque.  The appellant became angry that the victim had not answered her phone.  The victim went upstairs, put on her pyjamas and got into bed.  The appellant came into the bedroom, told her she could not sleep, and dragged her from the bed by her pyjama pants, tearing the drawstring of her pyjama pants.
5The appellant dragged the victim down the hallway and partially down the stairs.  The victim told the appellant to stop as he was hurting her and he did so.  She returned to the en suite bathroom in the bedroom and took off her pyjama pants.
6The appellant followed her with her mobile phone in his hand and proceeded to smash it.  He hit the victim in the face with the back of his hand and she went back to bed.  The victim heard the appellant making noise downstairs in what sounded like the opening and closing of cupboards.
7The appellant came upstairs and said to the victim that he would burn the bed or the house or ""it all down"".  The victim felt liquid being splashed across her and the bed.  She recognised the smell as being methylated spirits.  The victim jumped up and knelt on the bed, facing the appellant and said to him, ""What are you doing?""  She heard him flicking a cigarette lighter a couple of times, causing the methylated spirits to ignite.
8The victim saw flames all over her and heard the appellant say, ""Oh, fuck"".  The victim ran into the spare bedroom whilst trying to remove her jumper.  She threw the burning jumper onto the floor of the spare room and ran back towards the shower.  The appellant grabbed her and carried her to the shower in the main bathroom where she stayed until the flames were extinguished.  The victim cried for the appellant to get help. 
9At 11:55 pm, the appellant called ""000"", telling the operator, ""Methylated spirits, got ah, ignited and we got burnt"".  At midnight on 8 August 2009, the appellant called ""000"" again.  The appellant is recorded as saying, ""Don't tell them...Don't tell the cops please...""  Later during the call, the victim is heard saying, ""I won't say anything"" to which the appellant replies, ""Do not say what happened"".  The victim says to the appellant, ""You're too good to me"".
Circumstances Following the Offence  
10When the ambulance arrived, an ambulance officer, Kiri Muller, asked the victim what had happened.  The victim claimed that there had been an accident.
11A senior ambulance officer, Jacqueline Christian, treated the victim in the ambulance.  Ms Christian asked the victim, ""Did he do this to you?"" The victim replied, ""Yes"".  The victim said that she had been trying to get away from the male in the bed and he had poured ""metho"" on the bed and set it alight with a cigarette lighter.  
12Ms Muller was driving the ambulance back to the hospital when she heard Ms Christian say to the victim, ""So he did this to you"".  Ms Muller did not hear the victim's reply but saw the victim nodding when she looked in the rear view mirror.  As a result of this, Ms Muller decided to contact the police.
13The victim underwent two surgical procedures and remained in the Intensive Care Unit at Concord Hospital.  She later underwent a third procedure.
The Victim's Accounts to Family and Friends 
14The victim's sister, Leanne Scott, visited the victim on the night of 8 August 2009.  The victim was unable to speak as there were breathing tubes going down her throat.  She communicated with Ms Scott by writing on three pieces of A4 paper.  The victim wrote,  ""We had a fight, he had a lighter, he flick it and my clothes went up"".  She also wrote ""I'm not charging him"" and ""He didn't mean it"".  
15The following day, the victim was able to speak.  She told Ms Scott that she had been lying in bed when the appellant kicked and punched her, and the next minute he had flicked the lighter and she was on fire.  On 10 August 2009, Ms Scott attended the police station and handed over the three A4 pages with handwriting.  The A4 pages were dated and signed by Ms Scott on 10 August 2009. 
16A friend of the victim, Vicky Faulds, visited the victim on 9 August 2009.  The victim told Ms Faulds that she had argued with the appellant about women being present at the barbeque, as the appellant had informed her that it was a male only event.  She also told Ms Faulds that the appellant had been angry with her for refusing to answer the phone and that the appellant had taken her mobile phone and smashed it.  The victim said that the appellant dragged her downstairs and pushed her against a wall and hit her.  After the victim went back to bed, she said the appellant came into the bedroom and threw some ""metho"" at the quilt.  The appellant had a lighter in his hand and when the methylated spirits ignited the victim ran out of the bedroom and ripped off her pyjama top.  The victim said that she raced to the shower whilst the appellant was trying to put out the fire in a pile of clothes that had caught alight in the spare room when the victim had thrown her burning pyjama top onto it. 
17The victim asked Ms Faulds not to say anything about what she had told her.  When Ms Faulds asked the victim whether the appellant had thrown the methylated spirits at her, the victim replied ""no"" and said it was thrown on the quilt and that he had not meant it.  However, the victim said later that there had been a fight in which the appellant had thrown the methylated spirits at her and had teased her with the lighter while standing at the foot of the bed. 
18Another friend of the victim, Michelle Brown, first visited the victim on 8 August 2009, thereafter visiting her around 3 times a week.  During one of her visits, the victim told Ms Brown that the appellant had caused her injuries, asking, ""Why would he do this?""  The victim told Ms Brown that there had been a fight during which the appellant had said that if the victim did not get out of bed he would douse her with ""methyl"" and that he was ""flickering the light, and then it just went up"".  The victim also told Ms Brown that the appellant had told the victim to tell the ambulance officers that it had been an accident.  
19The victim's son, Ryan Coyne, first visited the victim on 8 August 2009, thereafter visiting her daily until 30 October 2009 when she was discharged.  In a conversation that took place about two weeks after the first visit, the victim told Mr Coyne that the appellant had thrown methylated spirits on her and had set her on fire.  
20A friend of the victim, Leah Tasker, visited the victim on 9 August 2009.  On that day, she entered the room on her own to find that the victim's sister Ms Scott was also in the room.  The victim told Ms Tasker and Ms Scott that she and the appellant had been arguing, that he was punching her when she asked him to stop and that she had wanted to sleep.  
The Victim's Statement to Police and its Retraction.
21On three separate occasions on 24 and 27 August and 3 September 2009, a police officer, Plain Clothes Constable Heffernan, visited the victim for the purposes of obtaining a statement.  Constable Heffernan brought with him the three A4 pages that the victim had written and that Ms Scott had brought in to the police station.  Constable Heffernan also had pictures of a broken mobile phone.  In the statement she provided to police, the victim gave a detailed account of the events of the night which was consistent with the accounts already provided to her family and friends, and confirmed that she recognised some of the writing on three A4 pages as being her handwriting.  She also stated that three photos of a broken mobile phone shown to her were those of her phone that had been smashed on the night.  The statement was dated 24 August 2009 and the bottom of each page was signed by the victim
22On 28 July 2011, the victim faxed a handwritten statement to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and to the legal representatives of the appellant.  The victim claimed that she had been heavily sedated and not fully conscious at the hospital when her friends and family had ""told [her] what they thought had happened on the night"".  She also wrote that her statement to police was ""not the truth"" and that she had no recollection of the events described upon reading it again.
23During the trial the victim was cross-examined by the prosecution as an unfavourable witness pursuant to s 38 of the Evidence Act 1995.  She maintained that the appellant did not douse her with methylated spirits and set her on fire and that the version in the police statement was not the truth even though she believed it was when she provided the statement.  The victim was cross-examined on the contents of her statement and versions of events she had given to the ambulance officer, family and friends.  
The Defence Case
24The appellant's case at trial was that after returning home from the barbeque, he lit a cigar and went upstairs to smoke the cigar on the balcony.  On reaching the balcony door, the appellant found that he could not open it and returned to the bedroom where the victim was sleeping. The appellant leant over the bed to give the victim a kiss before returning downstairs to finish the cigar.  As the appellant walked back up the stairs, he smelt smoke coming from the bedroom and when he reached the bedroom he saw smoke coming out of the bed in which the victim was asleep.  The appellant saw a bottle on the tallboy and thinking it was water, poured it on the bed.  The methylated spirits caught alight and the appellant tried to pat the flame down, causing burns to his hand.  He then grabbed the victim and put her in the shower.  He accidentally stood on the mobile phone as he went to search for burning clothes in the spare room. 
Grounds of Appeal 
25 The appellant appeals on the following grounds:
(1)The judge erred in admitting into evidence the victim's statement to investigating police
(2)A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the use made of the victim's statement to investigating police
(3)A miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the use made of evidence disclosing a consciousness of guilt
(4)The verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence
Grounds One and Two - Error in Admitting into Evidence the Victim's Statement to Police and Miscarriage of Justice Arising from its Use.
26It is convenient to deal with these two grounds together.  Ground one complains of error in admitting the physical document as an exhibit.  During the hearing of the appeal, contrary to what the appellant appeared to be submitting in writing, the appellant acknowledged that the contents of the statement were relevant and admissible in cross-examination as a prior inconsistent statement.  However, it was submitted that the jury would have given disproportionate weight to the victim's statement in the circumstances of the trial and that a miscarriage of justice thereby arose (Ground two).
27The handwritten notes compiled in the hospital were admitted (without objection) as Exhibit A.  The victim's police statement and the victim's statement of retraction were tendered by the Crown and became Exhibits O and P respectively.  The decision to admit the police statement over objection was made on the basis of the High Court's decision in Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57.  Consideration was not given to the effect of the amendment of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act) by the Evidence Amendment Act 2007. 
28At the time of the trial, s 101A of the Evidence Act relevantly provided :-
Credibility evidence, in relation to a witness or other person, is evidence relevant to the credibility of the witness or person that: (a) is relevant only because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, or (b) is relevant: (i) because it affects the assessment of the credibility of the witness or person, and (ii) for some other purpose for which it is not admissible, or cannot be used, because of a provision of Parts 3.2 to 3.6.   29The appellant submitted that the victim's police statement was 'credibility evidence' as defined in s 101A(b) of the Act because it affected the credibility of the victim and was relevant for an inadmissible purpose, namely a hearsay purpose. The appellant maintained that the statement did not fall within an exception to the hearsay rule. In particular, it did not fall within the exception where the maker of the representations was available to give evidence (s 66), because the representations were made for the purpose of indicating the evidence the person would be able to give: s 66(3). 
30The appellant conceded that the representations contained in the statement were admissible as an exception to the credibility rule, since the statement fell within the exception contained in s 103.  It was adduced in cross-examination of the victim by the Crown Prosecutor pursuant to the leave granted under s 38.  It could not be seriously contested that the evidence substantially affected the assessment of the credibility of the victim.  
31In addition, the contents of the statement were admissible pursuant to s 106 as a prior inconsistent statement.  The Crown Prosecutor complied with the requirements of s 106(1) and the victim denied the substance of the evidence, that is, whilst agreeing that she had received burns after she had been doused with methylated spirits which was ignited, she denied any knowledge of how that occurred and that the conduct of the appellant was deliberate : see R v Michael Anthony Ryan (No.7) [2012] NSWSC 1160 ; 218 A Crim R 384.  
32Once the contents of the statement were admissible for a non hearsay purpose, the representations constituted evidence of the facts : s 60.  
33Counsel at trial invoked s 137 of the Evidence Act to justify the exclusion of the victim's police statement, essentially on the same basis as that advanced on the hearing of the appeal, namely, that the jury would apportion too much weight to the statement.  How that consideration constituted a danger of unfair prejudice was not entirely made clear, given that it was never submitted that there was a risk that the jury would misuse the contents of the statement and the exercise required by s 137 is not concerned with the attribution of weight by the tribunal of fact : R v XY [2013] NSWCCA 121 at [66], [68], [163] - [168].  The contents of the statement were clear and unambiguous.  There was no room for competing inferences arising out of the contents of the statement.  The only conceivable use of the statement was to cast doubt on the reliability of the victim or to prove the commission of the offence.  In either case, it was not relevantly prejudicial.
34The probative value of the statement was considerable if accepted by the jury as a truthful version of events.  It included material that was wholly consistent with forensic evidence at the scene. Significant material included: (1)The victim described being dragged from the bed by the appellant holding onto the waist of her pyjama pants, and tearing them in the process. A torn pyjama drawstring was found close to the bed. The victim could offer no explanation when initially asked about the torn drawstring. She agreed that she could not have been given this information by her family or friends.(2)After the appellant had ripped her pyjama pants the victim got into bed wearing only underpants and a top, which she removed once she was alight. When the ambulance arrived she was only wearing a pair of underpants, consistent with the bottoms being removed at an earlier point in time. (3)The victim described her mobile phone being broken with the flip part being completely broken off, the battery and back cover separated and the sim card missing. This is an accurate description of the mobile phone as shown in the photographs taken at the scene. In evidence, the victim could offer no explanation as to how her telephone came to be broken and in the position as described in her statement. (4)In the statement the victim identified the liquid that was spilt on her as being methylated spirits. In her handwritten statement she only described the appellant as spilling liquid on her and at trial she denied that she had smelt methylated spirits. According to the appellant it would have been quite dark in the bedroom when the appellant entered and poured the methylated spirits on the victim. The victim would not have had the opportunity to see the bottle yet she was able to identify the substance as methylated spirits in her statement. (5)The victim stated that she could hear the sound of a cigarette lighter being operated as she heard the flint contacting the wheel of the light. This is consistent with the sound of a Bic lighter, which was found in the bedroom. According to the appellant, the lighter was in his pocket until after the victim was set alight and only fell from his pocket when he removed his mobile phone to call ""000"". On the victim's evidence and the appellant's version, there was no way that the victim could have been aware that he had taken the lighter from the kitchen to the bedroom. (6)The victim stated that she ran into the spare bedroom and threw the burning pyjama top onto a pile of clothes. This is consistent with the fire damage to the spare room. 
35A submission that the judge erred in admitting the statement must be determined on the basis of the material available at the time of the decision and the reasons that were advanced against its admission, not by a retrospective analysis of what use was made of it and what prominence it may have assumed.  If the evidence was correctly admitted at the time of the ruling, the only remaining question is whether a miscarriage of justice arose from its admission, having regard to other evidence adduced at trial : R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338, [36] - [42] per Simpson J (McCllelan CJ at CL agreeing).  
36No submission was advanced at trial that s 43(2) of the Evidence Act precluded the admission of the statement, on the basis that the victim admitted that she had made a prior inconsistent statement.  That submission was advanced on the hearing of the appeal.  In so far as the victim acknowledged that she had made the statement, but that she was merely relying upon what others had told her, it may be accepted that she was acknowledging that her police statement was inconsistent with her evidence at trial.  However, that does not of itself render the statement inadmissible.  As Barr J explained in R v Aslett [2006] NSWCCA 49 (Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreeing) at [76] :-
[Under the Evidence Act] there is a purpose in tendering such statements beyond any attack on credibility, namely proof of the facts asserted: s60. Nothing in s43 is directed to the admissibility of any prior inconsistent statement to prove the truth of its assertions. All subs(2) does is ensure that a witness who is about to be attacked on credit is fairly dealt with. Nothing in s43 purports to limit the effect of ss38, 103 or 60.
37In my view, there was no error in admitting the statement.  It had very substantial probative value and there was no risk of unfair prejudice.
38The appellant next submitted that admission of the victim's statement as an exhibit gave rise to a risk that it would be given undue weight (Driscoll v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 542; Butera v DPP (Vic) (1987) 164 CLR 180 at 189 -190).  It was submitted that the risk was heightened by the formal nature as well as the comprehensive and detailed content of the statement.
39The appellant argued that the risk of undue weight had to be assessed in the light of the emphasis given to the exhibit in the Crown Prosecutor's closing address and in the absence of any warning from the judge not to attribute disproportionate weight to the statement.  These factors in combination were said to create a real risk that it would be given disproportionate weight relative to other evidence in the trial (R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278 ; (2005) 63 NSWLR 628 at [11]; Gateley v The Queen (2007) 232 CLR 208 at [95]). 
40In my view, this argument is misconceived.  The victim's statement was not the basis of the evidence she gave at trial.  It was not a record of her evidence given at trial.  By admitting the statement as an exhibit, the jury were not given access to a reiteration of her evidence.  To the contrary, the jury were given an entirely different account to that advanced by the victim at trial.  The authorities of NZ and Gately are distinguishable on that basis alone.
41There was no dispute as to the authenticity of the statement : cf Driscoll. The victim agreed that she had signed the document after reading it in order to acknowledge the truth of what had been written.  In Butera, at 198, Dawson J referred to this aspect of Driscoll (that the accused claimed that the record of interview was a fabrication) in determining that the transcript of audio recordings did not attract the same considerations as a document, the veracity of which was disputed.
42The submission that there is a reasonable possibility that the use made of the victim's statement may have affected the jury's verdict, causing a miscarriage of justice ought be rejected.  The discussion in Baini v The Queen [2012] HCA 59 ; 246 CLR 469 at [53]-[56] and in Lee v R [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [29]-[34] demonstrates that, for the appellant to succeed on ground two, he must establish a causal connection between the admission of the statement and the verdict, in the sense that, but for the admission of the statement, the appellant might have been acquitted.  The principal impediment to success on this ground is that there was no error in admitting the statement and there was other copious evidence originating from the victim of the appellant's deliberate conduct leading to the ignition of the bedclothes.  Exhibit A fell into that category.  In addition, the jury had the advantage of weighing the police statement against the victim's retraction.  
43The trial judge gave appropriate directions, including :-
This case is a little different from many criminal prosecutions brought in these courts. In most cases but certainly not all, an alleged victim of crime provides a police statement, giving his or her version of the offence and will give evidence in the trial, supportive of that version. In the present case, there has been much focus by both parties on the original police statement provided by Ms Scott, by reason of the fact that she has not adhered to that version, in the trial itself. Accordingly the parties have spent a significant part of the trial examining the circumstances in which the initial police statement by Ms Scott was made. The police statement which is exhibit O has been admitted into evidence and you will have it available to you in the course of your considerations. It contains a version of events provided by Ms Scott to police in the 3 to 4 weeks after she suffered injuries. It is a matter for you to assess whether the version then supplied by her is the correct version of events and is reliable. If you consider it to be so, it is open to you to use the contents of that statement as part of the evidence. Perhaps you may think an important part of the evidence, upon which you will determine whether the Crown has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. In considering whether you accept that the police statement is correct and reliable, you will no doubt have regard to the relevant circumstances in which that statement was made. These include the physical and mental state of Ms Scott when she made the police statement on those three days. The effects of the medication which she had taken on her ability to accurately provide a version of events. Whether or not any of her visitors provided information to her about the alleged events and thus influenced her in her recollection. Whether or not the facts in the police statement were consistent with other accounts she provided to paramedics who attended her and she provided to her family and friends shortly afterwards. The contemporaneous statement she made, those statements at the time about her affection and loyalty towards Mr Col the accused. As well as whether the facts in those statements are consistent with the objective evidence found at the scene. Ladies and gentlemen, these are matters which I suggest you might look at. How you deal with them is a matter for you. Whether you think they are of use is a matter for you but in assessing whether or not you give weight to the statements made by Ms Scott, leading up to her police statement and including it, I suggest that you will need to look and examine those particular issues.It will also be necessary for you to consider the subsequent statement, exhibit P in which Ms Scott provided a version of events suggestive of accident rather than any criminal conduct by the accused. You will of course consider the evidence given in these proceedings and make your own judgements about the accuracy and reliability of the evidence. 
44Defence counsel did not request any further directions at the end of the Summing Up.  The absence of a warning from the trial judge against attributing too much weight to the statement was not necessary and was not sought.  Rule 4 applies.
45Disregarding the victim's statement, the accounts given by the victim to medical personnel, members of her family and friends, Exhibit A and the objective evidence in combination amounted to a strong Crown case.  The retraction by the victim only four days before the commencement of the trial and the victim's evidence at trial did very little to undermine it. 
46 I would dismiss grounds one and two.
Ground Three : Miscarriage of Justice Arising from Consciousness of Guilt Evidence.
47This ground is focussed upon two pieces of evidence in the trial, namely, the appellant's attempts to dissuade the victim from telling the ambulance personnel and police ""what happened"" and the appellant's account of how he came to move the bottle of methylated spirits onto the rear of the upper shelf of the walk in wardrobe, after the ambulance arrived.
48The recording of the ""000"" call was Exhibit L at trial.  The terms of the recorded conversation that are the subject of this ground are set out at [9] above.
49In the course of examination in chief, the appellant said that he did not remember what he said during the ""000"" call.  In cross-examination, the text of the recorded statements was put to the appellant and he continued to claim that he had no memory of those words.  He did not deny saying them.  The Crown Prosecutor put to the appellant that he was ""concerned that [he] had done something very wrong [and] concerned that [the victim not] say anything to the police about what [he] had done to cause that situation.""  The appellant refuted those suggestions.  
50In the course of the Crown Prosecutor's closing address, he said :-
If ...  this was some inadvertent accident where there hadn't been any sort of domestic fighting beforehand, there hadn't been any dragging down the stairs or anything like that, and he simply came to the rescue or the aid of Ms Scott, why on earth would he be saying, ""don't tell the cops please"". He would have a perfectly reasonable explanation as to him having made a mistake in terms of tipping - it is a matter for you whether it is a reasonable explanation - as to tipping methylated spirits over her thinking it was water. I ask you to examine that, members of the jury, that whole scenario. Does it ring true to you members of the jury, this suggestion and the accused's evidence that he grabbed this bottle thinking it was a bottle of water and then poured it on the already ignited it seems, Mary Anne Scott or the bed............................................................................If the accused had done nothing wrong, why is she not going to say anything, and why is he saying, ""don't say what happened"".
51In the closing address of the appellant's counsel, it was submitted that the appellant's entreaty to the victim not to ""tell the cops"" was explicable by the fact that the appellant had made a terrible mistake throwing methylated spirits on the victim and that ""he was afraid about how it might look.""  
52Exhibit K at trial consisted of four photographs, three of which depicted the empty bottle of methylated spirits at the rear of an upper shelf in the walk-in wardrobe of the bedroom occupied by the appellant and Ms Scott.  The fourth photograph was a close-up view of the label on the bottle of methylated spirits.  The exhibit was tendered during the Crown's cross-examination of the victim.  The victim identified the bottle in the photograph as the relevant bottle of methylated spirits and denied any knowledge of how it came to be in that position in the wardrobe.
53During cross-examination of the appellant, he was asked if he had placed the bottle on the upper shelf of the wardrobe.  The appellant claimed that after the ambulance had arrived at the property, he returned inside the house because he did not have his keys or wallet, that he found his keys but not his wallet and so he returned upstairs, came across the bottle as he did so, picked it up, ""didn't really think much of it and ... just tossed it.""
54The appellant further acknowledged in cross-examination that he had looked at the label and read ""methylated spirits"" before throwing the bottle into the wardrobe and at the time that he did so, he had already come to the realisation that it was methylated spirits that he had poured on to the victim.  The Crown Prosecutor put the allegation to the appellant that he had deliberately poured methylated spirits onto the bed clothes and set the bed alight, after an argument with the victim.  The Crown Prosecutor then suggested to the appellant that ""the reason why the methylated spirits bottle was in the upper shelf of the walk-in wardrobe area was because you realised that that was implicating you in having done precisely what I've just been putting to you?""  The appellant denied that suggestion.
55During the Crown's closing address, the Crown Prosecutor suggested that the appellant was ""trying to hide the evidence by putting [the bottle] where he did.""  After the address, the submission made to the jury with respect to the methylated spirits bottle was clarified between the Crown Prosecutor, the appellant's counsel and the trial judge.  The Crown maintained that it was available to the jury to draw the inference that the appellant consciously attempted to hide the methylated spirits bottle.  The appellant's counsel agreed that the inference was available and did not require any correction, beyond a request that the trial judge read the questions and answers to the jury.  Ultimately, that was what the trial judge did. In addition, the trial judge said :-
I should say at this point that Mr Crown in his submissions made the submission that the reason that the accused threw the bottle away was that he was hiding evidence. It is certainly true that no such specific proposition was put to Mr Col to allow him to answer it. The Crown as I apprehended, intended that to be a submission as an inference that you could draw from the facts and the evidence that he would rely upon, as I understand it, is the passage I have just read to you.
56In short, the principal use which was made of the ""000"" call and the appellant's conduct with respect to the methylated spirits bottle was to rebut the alternative explanation advanced by the defence, namely that of accident, in response to a circumstantial Crown case.  The judge confirmed the basis of the Crown case in the summing up.  After giving an unexceptional direction to the jury about the drawing of inferences and the importance of excluding other reasonable alternatives, the judge said :-
How does that apply in the present case? In the present case the Crown asks you to draw an inference that given the presence, the location and condition of various physical exhibits, the second written statement of Ms Scott, the handwritten one, the evidence of the accused cannot be the true position. He points to the presence of the methylated spirits bottle in the bedroom. He points to the presence of the cap of that bottle on the bed, to the presence of the mobile phone in a broken state near the bed, the unexplained absence of the SIM card to that phone, of the ultimate and unexplained location of the metho bottle in the wardrobe, why it got there, and as to the presence of the torn pyjama cord near the bed where Ms Scott was originally lying.The accused argues as against those that there are other reasonable explanations for those matters which are not consistent with the guilt of the accused. His counsel contends that the damage to the phone could equally have been caused, as the accused said in evidence, by his stepping on the phone in the aftermath of the fire, that the other damage to the pyjama cord and the like could have occurred in the subsequent chaos when the fire went out of control, that the metho bottle and its presence in the bedroom had a perfectly rational explanation, namely it had been used the night before for the purpose of assisting the accused administer steroids, that the lighter and its presence in the bedroom was explained by the fact that it had been in the accused's pocket and dropped out of his pocket as he reached in to use the phone to call 000 and that the initial fire in the bed may have been caused by his dropping parts of a lit cigar onto the bed.So ladies and gentlemen, when you consider what inferences you draw from the physical facts, you will weigh up all of those and you will say to yourself ""well, is the conclusion that the Crown asks me to draw the only rational and reasonable conclusion or is what the accused says and his counsel on his behalf argued, a reasonable alternative.""
57The appellant submits that, to the extent that the cross-examination of the appellant and the Crown Prosecutor's submissions suggested that the appellant's words and conduct amounted to a consciousness of guilt, a direction such as that discussed in Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28 ; 200 CLR 234 ought to have been given.  
58In Zoneff, the accused was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor in terms that suggested he told a number of lies both in and out of court, but because the accused was self represented, there was no Crown address.  An incomplete and unsatisfactory Edwards direction (Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193) was given by the trial judge, in circumstances where the issue of lies could only have gone to the credit of the accused.  It was against that background that the High Court suggested the following direction :-
You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.
59There are three limbs to the direction.  The first is that it is a matter of fact for the jury to determine whether deliberate lies were told.  The second is it is a matter for the jury what significance they attach to those lies.  The third is a warning not to reason directly from an adverse finding on the credibility of the accused to guilt of the offence.
60In this case, it was not directly alleged that the appellant had told lies or was telling lies in the course of his evidence.  It may be accepted that the appellant's credibility was in issue to the extent that the Crown case was that his account of the accidental ignition of the bedclothes was not worthy of belief.  However, there could be no risk that the jury would reason directly towards guilt from an acceptance that the appellant tried to silence the victim or that he had tried to hide incriminating evidence.  The jury were instructed that they could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant's guilt unless they were able to reject the appellant's explanation as a reasonably available one, and only after the appellant's conduct (which was not disputed) was taken together with all the other evidence on which the Crown relied.  
61A Zoneff direction was neither required nor desirable in the circumstances of this case.   There was no risk of a misunderstanding on the jury's part as to the use to which they might put the appellant's conduct.  It was not submitted at trial or on the hearing of the appeal that the appellant's conduct was incapable of supporting an inference of guilt.  More importantly, the directions of the judge conformed to the spirit of what was said in R v Heyde (1990) NSWLR 234 at 244, namely, provided that it is open to the jury to rationally draw an inference that consciousness of guilt motivated the relevant conduct on the part of the accused, the jury should be directed that such an inference cannot be drawn unless other reasonable explanations for the conduct inconsistent with a consciousness of guilt have been excluded. 
62Rule 4 applies to this ground.  I would refuse leave to rely upon it.
Ground Four : Unreasonable Verdict
63The appellant submits that on the whole of the evidence at trial, there remains the reasonable possibility that the appellant did not deliberately set the victim alight and that, in all of the circumstances, it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant caused grievous bodily harm with intent to do so. 
64On the hearing of the appeal, the appellant acknowledged that it was open to the jury to reject the appellant's account in evidence at trial, as well as his prior accounts to treating medical practitioners and the evidence of the victim at trial, to the effect that the incident was in the nature of an accident.  The appellant also acknowledges that his explanation for the incident, which was effectively adopted by the victim, was inconsistent with objectively reliable evidence and inconsistent with his representations before trial.
65It is not suggested that an outright acquittal is appropriate, rather that the Court should enter a substituted verdict for the alternative offence of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm.  Whilst acknowledging that it was open to the jury to find that the appellant deliberately threw a volatile liquid onto the bed, in the knowledge that the victim was in the bed, and that the act of flicking the lighter was deliberate, the appellant nonetheless maintained that it was equally open as an inference that the appellant either did not deliberately light the fire or, if he deliberately lit the fire, that he did not intend to set the victim alight.  In other words, accepting that the appellant had been violent towards the victim, that she had retreated to the bedroom, that he said ""you are not sleeping in the bed tonight"", that he went downstairs, retrieved the lighter and methylated spirits from the kitchen cupboard, returned to the bedroom, doused the bed with methylated spirits, uttered the threat that he would burn the bed or the house down, then deliberately flicked the lighter (one or more times from the foot of the bed), it was nonetheless a reasonably available inference that the appellant intended no more than to tease or taunt the victim.
66Having examined the whole of the evidence at trial, I am of the view that it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant intentionally caused grievous bodily harm to the victim.  In coming to that conclusion, I have not disregarded the fact that the victim told a number of her friends whilst in hospital that the appellant ""did not mean it"", that the appellant said ""Oh fuck"" when the fire took hold on the bedclothes and that the appellant immediately grabbed the victim and took her into the shower.  Nor have I disregarded the obvious distress on the part of the appellant in the course of the ""000"" calls and statements to the effect that he did not mean to harm the victim.
67The test for an unreasonable verdict or one that cannot be supported having regard to the evidence is not satisfied by demonstrating that the jury might have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt : Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30 ; 230 CLR 559 at [113] ; Lee v The Queen [2013] NSWCCA 68 at [200] - [202].  The evidence ""did not require the conclusion that the jury should necessarily have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt"" : Libke at [113].  
68The evidence that the appellant expressed his intention to ""burn it all down"" shortly before dousing the bed with methylated spirits, and that he deliberately flicked the lighter, after the victim had knelt in the bed and asked him what he was doing, provided a compelling basis for the jury's verdict, notwithstanding any expressions of regret that followed upon the appellant's realisation of what he had done.  There was no necessary inconsistency, in my view, between the appellant taunting the victim and then making good the threat.  The jury was required to infer from the appellant's words and conduct that he intended to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim, at the time that he deliberately flicked the lighter.  Even if that intention was of a transitory nature, it was sufficient for the purposes of the offence.  It was open to the jury to conclude that that was the only reasonably available inference.  
69I would dismiss this ground.
70I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.
71ROTHMAN J : I have had the advantage of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Latham J and the orders she proposes.  I agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed.  I wish to add some short further comment on the ground of appeal based on an ""unreasonable verdict"".
72The test for an unreasonable verdict is whether, on the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, at 493; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400, at [14].  The Court is required to make an ""independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"".
73In accordance with that requirement, I have read the evidence and independently assessed whether a reasonable doubt exists.  It is always theoretically possible that someone or something that sounds plausible and believable is inaccurate or wrong.  It is theoretically possible that a person, who sounds truthful, is in fact being untruthful or inaccurate.  It is for that reason that the High Court, in stating the test to be applied, remarked that the Court ""must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses"": M v The Queen, at 493.
74Essentially, the Crown case depends on the truth of accounts given by the victim, otherwise than in evidence, to a range of persons, and inferences arising therefrom.  Those earlier extra-curial statements are believable, generally consistent with each other such statement, and also consistent with the independent evidence.
75Further, as is clear from the analysis of Latham J, the alternative view is in some significant respects inconsistent with all of the earlier statements, and with the independent evidence.  The jury were in a better position than are we to assess the demeanour of the witnesses.  Nevertheless, the whole of the evidence does not, in my view, raise a doubt of the requisite kind and, to the extent one can rely on transcript for this purpose, is consistent with the truth of the earlier extra-curial statements by the victim.
76I have no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellant.  Many cases depend on the jury accepting one version of events and rejecting another; sometimes from one witness.  There was a proper basis on which the jury could reject the innocent explanation, and a proper basis for accepting, to the requisite standard, that version, which established guilt.
77The circumstance that one version in evidence ""is accepted and another ... rejected, of itself, and without independent evidence or some other factor affecting that assessment, cannot be a basis upon which a jury verdict is necessarily rendered unreasonable"": Brendon Singh v R [2011] NSWCCA 100 at [132].  In this case, I agree with the jury's assessment.  At the very least, the ""jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving ... [any] ... doubt"" that might otherwise be experienced (M v The Queen, at 494-495).  There has been no miscarriage of justice.
78DAVIES J : I agree with Latham J.

		03 December 2013",2013-12-02 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705749,Tilse v State of New South Wales [2013] NSWDC 265,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Ms Melissa Leigh Tilse of Grafton brings an action for damages for the tort of false imprisonment. She claims compensatory damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages. The statement of claim is pleaded in such a way as to suggest that ""wrongful arrest"" is a tort. However, it is not. Nevertheless, a wrongful arrest may commence a period of false imprisonment. Such is the plaintiff's allegation.

2The defendant seeks to justify the arrest and therefore the imprisonment of the plaintiff on the grounds that the arresting police officer suspected on reasonable grounds that the plaintiff had committed the offence of affray justifying an arrest under s 99(2) of Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA) and pursuant to s 99(3)(d) that it was necessary to arrest the plaintiff to prevent the harassment of or interference with witnesses nominated in the defence as Mr Brett Watson, the licensee of the Coutts Crossing Tavern, his wife, Mrs Kim Watson, and Ms Nadine Close.

3There is no dispute that at 1.35pm on Sunday, 1 May 2011, Senior Constable Peter Barnier of the Grafton Police arrested the plaintiff at Grafton Police Station and that the plaintiff was kept in custody at the Grafton Police Station until 7.18pm, on that evening when she was released on bail. There is no dispute that the period of time in custody was for five hours and 43 minutes. The issue for determination is whether the Senior Constable Barnier suspected on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to arrest the plaintiff in order to prevent the harassment or intimidation of the witnesses named in the defence. Despite the relatively short period that the plaintiff was in custody and the narrowness of the issues tendered for my determination, the matter has been hotly contested and nearly every point that could possibly be raised has been taken. 

4On Monday, 11 March 2013, I commenced a two-week sitting of this Court in its civil jurisdiction at Coffs Harbour. The first seven days were taken up with an action bought by a plaintiff named Randall against the State of New South Wales in which that gentleman alleged that he was assaulted and falsely imprisoned at the Casino police Station by police. I delivered judgment in that matter last Thursday, 5 December. That matter in fact went for a further three days in Sydney, after the seven days in Coffs Harbour. When I finished the matter of Randall at Coffs Harbour this matter commenced and took the rest of the two-week's sittings, namely three days. Only two witnesses were called in the plaintiff's case; the plaintiff herself and Ms Samantha Polley. The only witness called in the defence case was Senior Constable Barnier. He commenced his evidence at 12.49pm on Thursday, 21 March 2013. His evidence could not be completed on Friday, 22 March, as the court needed to adjourn early for the convenience of counsel. His evidence was completed in Sydney on Friday, 26 April 2013. All told, the Senior Constable's cross-examination took the best part of two days. There were then some interlocutory skirmishes before me in Sydney on 9 August 2013 and the matter was then set down for further hearing before me on the 5 and 6 December. I did not reach this matter on 5 December owing to the fact that I was giving judgment in the matter of Randall. This matter continued before me on Friday 6 and Monday 9 and Tuesday 10 December 2013. Yesterday I took ""time out"" in order to read the voluminous material to which I had been referred. 

5No concession was made by either party, in essence, about any point. For example, the plaintiff said that I would not accept the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier as being reliable, accurate or honest, and the defendant said the same thing about the plaintiff's evidence. The defendant submitted that judgment should be entered in its favour or, in the alternative, that at most the plaintiff's damages should be no more than $5,000 whereas the plaintiff submitted that she ought be awarded damages between $50,000 to $60,000 and interest.

The plaintiff's evidence

6I turn now to consider the plaintiff's evidence. The plaintiff was born on 26 April 1981. She was to turn 30 on 26 April 2011. She has at least three children. At the time she had living with her her daughter, Lyesha, who was then aged 11, and also residing with her was her daughter, Hope, who was then nine, and then also a third daughter, Isabelle, who was then five. I have stated that the plaintiff was the mother of at least three children because the plaintiff needed to be excused one afternoon, 20 March 2013, because she had to return from Coffs Harbour to Grafton to look after three children to whom she referred as her children and her grandchildren. That can be seen on p 77 of the transcript. 

7At relevant times the plaintiff was unemployed. In 2011 she was studying a TAFE course for a Certificate IV in Information Technology. She was attending Grafton TAFE on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, full time, and for a half day each Thursday. At relevant times the plaintiff was in a relationship with Mr David Daley. The evidence which the plaintiff gave, recorded on pp 30 and 31 of the transcript, lead to the view that the plaintiff may have been in a relationship with David Daley between August 2008 and October 2011 However, the plaintiff referred to the relationship as persisting for only some two and a half years ending in October 2011. There is evidence to suggest that at some stage the plaintiff and Mr Daley may have cohabited but the plaintiff gave evidence that he stayed overnight at her residence ""now and then"". However, it is clear that a number of witnesses believed that the plaintiff and Mr Daley were a defacto husband and wife. 

8Anzac Day 2011 was also Easter Monday. It was also the eve of the plaintiff's 30th birthday. On Anzac Day 2011 the plaintiff and David Daley, amongst others, were to visit the Coutts Crossing Tavern in the village of Coutts Crossing. It is clear that the plaintiff had some long association with that village. When interviewed by police, in particular by Senior Constable Barnier on 1 May 2011, the plaintiff said this,

""It's a lot easier if I just go out there [Coutts Crossing] rather than all my friend's out there... having to come into town. ...as I pretty much have lived out [at] Coutts basically since I was 22, that's pretty much been my home town.""

The plaintiff's parents were, in 2011, living at Coutts Crossing on the corner of Kangaroo Creek Road and Kudaroo Place. As at Anzac Day 2011 Mr Desmond Watson, the father of the licensee of the Coutts Crossing Tavern, Mr Brett Watson, had known the plaintiff for nine years as her mother had worked at the hotel. One might infer, therefore, that the plaintiff's parents had been living in Coutts Crossing since about 1992. There appeared to me to be an attempt by the plaintiff to downplay her familiarity with the Coutts Crossing Tavern. 

9Evidence can be gleaned from the plaintiff as to where she lived from time to time. She told me that she had left home at the age of 14. That would indicate that she had left home in about 1995. The plaintiff told me of living in Ulmarra for about two years, and then living in Braunstone for two and a half years, then living in Lower Kangaroo Creek Road at Coutts Crossing for three months; and then living in Tallowood Street, South Grafton for six months commencing in April 2008 but moving from Tallowood Street, South Grafton to 73 Oliver Street, Grafton where she had lived since October 2010. Clearly there is some discrepancy in the dates because if the plaintiff moved to Tallowood Street, South Grafton in April 2008 and only lived there for six months, she would have moved to Oliver Street, Grafton at the end of 2008 rather than in October 2010. One can see the plaintiff living with her parents from 1992 to 1995 at Coutts Crossing and, on the plaintiff's chronology, living at Braunstone for two and a half years which may have been in 2005, 2006 and 2007, then going to Coutts Crossing for a short period of three months into early 2008 before moving into Grafton or South Grafton. 

10Coutts Crossing is a village 18 kilometres south of Grafton and represents a place where a road to Armidale crosses the Orara River. Braunstone is a village nine kilometres north-east of Coutts Crossing and 14 kilometres south of Grafton. When the plaintiff was asked about whether the closest licensed premises to her when she lived at Braunstone was the Coutts Crossing Tavern the plaintiff said that the closest ""pub"" was at Glenreagh. Glenreagh, according to any map one needs to consult, is 33 kilometres south of Braunstone. In other words, when the plaintiff told me that the closest pub to Braunstone was at Glenreagh, she was not telling me the truth. The only reason not to tell the truth on such a relevantly trivial matter is, of course, to downplay her association with the Coutts Crossing Tavern. 

11In any event, the plaintiff went to Coutts Crossing on the afternoon of Anzac Day in order to have drinks with a number of her friends who lived in Coutts Crossing. She went to the house of Ms Cindy Wilson at 18 Lakkari Street, Coutts Crossing. She went there with Mr David Daley and her three children. The plaintiff went to Coutts Crossing at 3.30. The inference from what she said in the police interview is that she started drinking alcoholic beverages at 4 o'clock. At 4.30 the plaintiff, David Daley and others left 18 Lakkari Street and went to the Coutts Crossing Tavern. She told me that 18 Lakkari Street was only a ""five minute walk from the pub"". It was conceded by learned counsel for the plaintiff, that at the Coutts Crossing Tavern, she kicked Mr Peter Travers and that led her to being involved with the police. At the tavern the plaintiff spoke with the police and gave to Senior Constable Barnier her details.

12The plaintiff said that she had ordered hot chips from the kitchen at the tavern, which opened at 6pm in order to take the hot chips back to Lakkari Street for her children to have for dinner. The plaintiff said that as soon as she spoke to the police she obtained the hot chips ""over the bar"" and headed back to the house in order to feed the children. When she was at 18 Lakkari Street police attended the house. She could recall speaking with Detective King but she did not recall in her evidence-in-chief Senior Constable Barnier's being there. This evidence was then given:

""Q. Was there a disagreement with police officers at Lakkari Street?

A. There was a little bit, yes. They sort of walked into the house without having been let in and woke up all the children and we told them that Dave [Daley] wasn't at the house. We'd already told them he'd got a lift back to town but, yeah, they didn't take much notice of us and continued searching the house.

Q. How did that make you feel?

A. I was a bit upset, you know, mainly because the kids - we'd only just settled them down and got them down and, yeah, they were all sort of up wondering what was going on.""

13Before turning to the events of 1 May 2011, the plaintiff was asked in chief a number of questions about the three persons nominated in the defence. The plaintiff said that she didn't know Nadine Close and that she would not be able to point her out and did not recall what she looked like. She said that she knew Mrs Kim Watson because she and her husband, Mr Brett Watson, had been running the Coutts Crossing Tavern for many years and because her mother had worked at that tavern for approximately 14 or 15 years, and that had been her mother's last employment. When asked about Mr Brett Watson, the plaintiff identified him as the publican at the tavern and then went on to say this:

""I don't really get along with the bloke too well. I try not to - don't - I don't really go to the Coutts pub. I only went there that night 'cause it was my birthday the next day and my friends all lived out there.""'

She went on to describe Mr Watson as a very fit man who engaged in, amongst other sports, boxing. She went on to say that despite her not getting along well with Mr Watson she thought Ms Kim Watson was a ""pretty nice lady"" with whom she got on well. She then said that when she was living at Braunstone it was ""too far"" to travel to and from the Coutts Crossing Hotel. That was somewhat inconsistent with the evidence she gave in cross-examination about the nearest hotel to Braunstone being at Glenreagh, some 33 kilometres south of Braunstone. 

14The plaintiff's evidence then turned to the events of Sunday, 1 May 2011. The plaintiff said that on that day she had mown the lawn and then she had a shower. Prior to her getting into the shower she observed that David Daley was ""going somewhere"". She had the shower because she was hot and sweaty. She said that when she was drying herself after showering her lodger, Samantha Polley, knocked on the bathroom door and told her that the police had arrived. She then finished dressing and walked out the front to speak to the police. Even on this piece of evidence there is a dispute. Senior Constable Barnier said that when he knocked on the door at 73 Oliver Street on 1 May 2011 the door was answered by the plaintiff. There is corroboration in that regard for the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier from the evidence by Samantha Polley. She said (T.113) that Melissa, meaning the plaintiff, opened the door to the police. When she said that, this question and answer were given:

""Q. I want you to think about this. Did Melissa answer the door or did you answer the door or perhaps ... Lyesha opened the door. Lyesha would have been 11 then.
A. She could have opened the door, I'm not sure. Melissa normally answers the door"". 

When asked what the plaintiff had been doing prior to her answering the door Ms Polley said that she had been cleaning the house. She was asked what clothing the plaintiff was wearing and Ms Polley said that she was wearing her Parramatta Eels shirt and footy shorts. Those are the garments which the plaintiff was wearing, which one can see in the electronically recorded interview made later that afternoon at the Grafton Police Station. Accordingly, it is very easy for me to accept that the plaintiff answered the door based on the evidence of both Senior Constable Barnier and Ms Polley who was called in the plaintiff's case. 

15The evidence that the plaintiff gave about her movements immediately prior to police attending her home at 1.20pm on 1 May 2011 appears to have been given to excite some sympathy for the plaintiff herself. In her evidence-in-chief the plaintiff said that she said to the police ""What's going on?"" and that the police officer who spoke asked to speak with David Daley. There is really no dispute that the person who interrogated the plaintiff at the door of 73 Oliver Street on 1 May 2011 was in fact Senior Constable Barnier. She said that there were two male police standing at the front door, both in uniform, and these are clearly Senior Constable Barnier and then Probationary Constable George Andrew Chakty. The plaintiff then said that she asked the police officer who was speaking words to the effect of what was going on or what was happening. She then said that she may have said words to the effect of what do you want to speak to David Daley about, or something ""along those lines"". The plaintiff then said that the police office said ""Well, we're here to arrest him for assault"". The plaintiff replied to that ""Well, have you arrested Peter Travers?"" who was the person who was alleged to have been assaulted by David Daley. According to the plaintiff, the police officer said ""We've already arrested him and charged him with assault and released him on bail"". The plaintiff then said that in answer to that she probably said ""I'll bring Dave down when he gets back"". She said that she said that because she believed the he had gone out when she was in the shower. She said that very shortly after saying that, that she realised he was still in the house and he actually had not left the house.

16This again raises an issue as to why the plaintiff said she was in the shower. Was it to maintain the position that she believed that David Daley had left the house whilst she was in the shower, so that she could justify stating to police, as the police state she did, that he was not at home? When asked what the police officer said in response to her statement, that she would bring Mr Daley down to the station when he returned home, the plaintiff said that the officer said ""We're coming in to have a look"" and the plaintiff said ""Well, hang on. I'll go in and just double-check"". She also then volunteered that the police officer did mention something about someone's head sticking out of a window to which the plaintiff said that she may have replied ""It may be one of the children"". She said that the police denied that it was one of the children and she went and looked and that was when she saw Mr Daley inside the house and told him to go out to the front to meet the police. He did so and was arrested and put in the back of a caged police vehicle. The plaintiff's evidence continued thus:

""Q. What happened then, after he was put in the police car?

A. Then - I believe its Barnier said to me, 'Well, what are you doing?' and I said 'Well, about to watch the football soon. I just mowed the lawn and had a shower' and he's said 'Well can you come down the station and give a statement? When is it possible time you could come and give a statement?'""

The plaintiff then told Senior Constable Barnier about her TAFE commitments and that she could attend the police station on a Thursday afternoon or a Friday. She then said that Senior Constable Barnier asked her whether she could come to the police station ""right now"". The plaintiff said that she told the Senior Constable that she had two of her children there, her middle child, Hope, was away at a sleepover and she was awaiting a phone call so that she knew when to go and pick up Hope. She then said that Senior Constable Barnier said words to this effect, ""Well ... if she calls while you're giving your statement, you can go to pick her up and come back"". She then said that the Senior Constable said that the giving of the statement was only going to ""take an hour or two"". 

17The plaintiff then said that she told the Senior Constable that she had no-one to look after her other children who were in the house and it was Senior Constable Barnier who pointed out Ms Samantha Polley and he asked the plaintiff whether Ms Polley could look after the children. The plaintiff told, according to her evidence, the Senior Constable that Ms Polley didn't drive and she would be unable to pick up her daughter and that Ms Polley herself ""had to get going"" and that she could watch them for ""an hour or two"". She then said that she asked Ms Polley if it was all right for her to mind the two children and that Ms Polley replied ""yes, but not to be ""any longer than that"", meaning an hour or two. The plaintiff then said that she then reiterated to the police officer that if her daughter's friend's mother rang to pick up Hope that she could go and pick her daughter up. She then jumped into her motor vehicle and the police remained in their vehicle, stationary, until they saw her car pulling out of the driveway and then they themselves started what would have been a relatively short journey to the Grafton Police Station.

18What was said at the door between the plaintiff and Senior Constable Barnier is, of course, contested. However, there is again some corroboration for the Senior Constable's version from what was said by Ms Polley. In her evidence-in-chief Ms Polley said that she was living at 73 Oliver Street, Grafton as at 1 May 2011; that she ""got home"" not long before the police arrived at 1.20pm. She then gave this evidence,

""They asked if Dave, her partner at the time, was there, and I didn't know if he was there or not and then, yeah, they asked her about the incident at Coutts and asked her, like, would she please come down and make a statement, and she said yes, asked them what time, and they said today, and not long after they left, she left.

Q. Was there any discussion about children?
A. Yeah. She had two of her children at home at the time. I had to baby-sit them.""

In cross-examination Ms Polley said that she had babysat for the plaintiff before and referred to the plaintiff's daughters as ""like my little sisters"". She said that she enjoyed looking after them and that the plaintiff trusted her to look after them and that in the past she had fed them and bathed them. She said that she is content to look after the children and that it was no problem for her. There was no suggestion in Ms Polley's evidence that there was some time constraint on the period during which she could look after the plaintiff's children, nor was there any suggestion by Ms Polley that she had some engagement to which she had to attend on the afternoon of Sunday, 1 May 2011, which limited the time in which she was available to look after the plaintiff's children. It appeared to me after I heard the evidence of Ms Polley that the plaintiff had tried to limit her availability to look after the children in order to place greater significance than might otherwise attach to the length of time that she spent at the Grafton Police Station. 

19In chief, the plaintiff said that she entered the Grafton Police Station where there is a foyer which is open to members of the public. There was an officer behind the desk in the foyer and she told him that she had come to the police station in order to give a statement. She was asked to wait in the foyer. She then said that an officer came to the glass door at the side of the counter, meaning the desk in the foyer, opened the door and invited the plaintiff to come through the door into the interior of the police station. She said that she stepped inside the door and the officer began shutting it, then he put his hand on her handbag and told her that she was under arrest. The plaintiff made it quite clear that the arrest was not in the foyer but only after she has passed through the door between the foyer and the inside of the police station. There is an issue about that. 

20Senior Constable Barnier, who was the arresting officer, said that he arrested the plaintiff in the foyer. Despite the fact that it is now common ground that the police officer who spoke with the plaintiff at the door of her house at 1.20pm was in fact Senior Constable Barnier, and although the plaintiff herself referred to Senior Constable Barnier by name earlier when telling me what had happened at the front door of her house, the plaintiff was unable to identify the arresting officer and did not appear to accept that it was Senior Constable Barnier, although it is now common ground that it was him. This ""credit issue"" I find to be bemusing. It would be in the interests of Senior Constable Barnier for him to say that the plaintiff was only arrested after she had entered into that part of the police station where members of the public are not admitted because it would indicate that the arrest was not in a public place. However that is not his position. Equally, it would be in the interests of the plaintiff herself to maintain that she was arrested in the foyer of the police station, in a place open to members of the public. However, the significance of the place of arrest would probably be of more note to a police officer than to the plaintiff. The admission by Senior Constable Barnier that he arrested the plaintiff in the foyer is essentially against his interest because he arrested her in a public place. I therefore am prepared to accept his evidence, that he did arrest her in the foyer of the police station, but again, the evidence is positive that there was no-one in the foyer of the police station at the time of the plaintiff's arrest. However in the grand scheme of things this ""credit issue"" can have little moment.

21The plaintiff said that when she was told that she was under arrest she was ""stunned"". She said that she said to the police officer ""Why, when I was asked to come and give a statement?"" She then went on to say this:

""I was really stunned, just totally shell-shocked at that moment and just thinking of my children. They've only got a babysitter for two hours, like what am I going to do? I won't be able to ring them. Yeah, everything just started running through my head as to what was going to happen with my daughter that wasn't home.""

In cross-examination the plaintiff said that at the time that she was told that she was under arrest she was ""pretty shell-shocked"" which of course is consistent with what she said in chief. 

22Of course, I do not accept that the plaintiff only had a ""babysitter for two hours"" but I do accept that she was concerned about being able to communicate with her babysitter and/or her children if her phone were removed and how she would make arrangements to pick up her daughter if she could not take a phone call from her daughter's friend's mother or otherwise communicate with her daughter's friend's mother. Whether the plaintiff was actually shell-shocked or stunned depends largely on my acceptance or otherwise of the reliability of her evidence. 

23There is really no dispute about subsequent events at the police station. They can be gleaned from contemporaneous records. The arrest is recorded as occurring at 1.35pm. At 1.37 she was assigned to cell 2. One minute later she was received by the custody manager, Senior Constable Ryan Lynch. At 2.04pm Senior Constable Lynch completed the form on which he was required to make a brief assessment and a visual assessment of the plaintiff. At the same time he also filled out the medical questionnaire and made his general comments. One can accept that that process took the best part of half an hour. At 2.08pm the plaintiff was permitted a toilet break. The custody management record, exhibit C, shows that toilet break lasting for four minutes. At 3.50pm an electronically recorded interview with suspected person commenced and that finished at 4.44pm. One can accept some short time prior to the commencement of the interview that time would have been taken to set up the room and to move the plaintiff from her cell to the interview room. One can accept that after the conclusion of the interview some time would be taken returning the plaintiff to her cell. At 4.50pm, six minutes after the conclusion of the interview a court attendance notice was made. It is exhibit F. The 4.50pm time is shown as date of creation of the court attendance notice on the form itself. At 7.02pm the court attendance notice, a bail undertaking and a facts sheet were printed out. The custodial management record tells me that the plaintiff was formally charged at 7.10pm and released on bail at 7.18pm. 

24The plaintiff was shown a field arrest form which became exhibit B. That lists the property that the plaintiff had on her. Inter alia, she had taken with her to the police station a drink bottle which indicates that she thought she could be there for some time that could be categorised as other than short, but of course that might have been merely an hour. Nothing can be gleaned from that fact. The plaintiff confirmed that the property listed on the field arrest form was the property that she had at the time. The plaintiff was not searched. She said that the only other person in custody at the time she was in custody was Mr David Daley. She told me that she heard her telephone ringing when it had been removed from her custody and she told me that the police had told her that they would answer her phone and give her a message, but when her phone rang it was not answered and she was never given any message. There is no contest about that issue.

25The plaintiff stated shortly after her interview with Senior Constable Ryan was completed that she needed to use the lavatory and that she needed a tampon from her bag. The plaintiff told me that the police ""let me grab one"". She then asked that the curtains giving public view to her cell be drawn whilst she used the lavatory and that was done. She said it was drawn ""briefly"". She then said that the curtain was drawn for about ten minutes and then was re-opened by the police. There is no suggestion that the plaintiff's private affairs were observed by any member of the New South Wales Police in the station or indeed by Mr Daley when she needed to use the lavatory and use a tampon.

26The plaintiff makes no complaint about the way in which she was interviewed other than making a complaint about the coldness of the interview room. She gave this evidence:

""Q. During the interview with the police officers, how did you feel, how did you feel?
A. Freezing. My voice was trembling because I was so cold. But, yeah, I was just a bit, sort of, confused, I suppose - really as to still why they were arresting me. I'm not saying I didn't do anything wrong but compared to the other two [David Daley and Peter Travers] and what they did I was miniscule.

Q. After the interview concluded, what happened then?
A. Then they said - I said, 'Well, what happens now?' and they said 'You're going to go back into the cell until we finalise the interview records and draw up the paperwork.' I then asked them about how long they think that may take because I was pretty worried and a bit stressed at the time about where my kids were. They said, 'Not quite sure. Another hour. Maybe longer.' I then asked for a blanket because I was, yeah, freezing.

Q. Was a blanket provided to you?
A. Yes, it was then provided. Yes.""

The request for the blanket is not contained in the ERISP. However the plaintiff said that it was only after the conclusion of the ERISP that she asked for the blanket and that it was provided. In cross-examination the plaintiff said a number of things about the interview. At p 30 the following question and answer are recorded:

""Q. Did you do that during the interview, did you embrace yourself as if you were cold?
A. Yes, I would have. I was sitting there pretty much the whole time leaning on the table. I think I sat back at some points but sort of the whole time I was freezing.""

27Later, questions were asked about the behaviour of Senior Constable Barnier who did most of the talking at the interview. When asked whether the Senior Constable was polite the plaintiff agreed but grudgingly, stating, ""He wasn't rude I suppose"". She then described him as being ""a bit sarcastic"" and said that he made comments which she found difficult to explain and then she said that she thought he was mocking her. When pressed about what she was referring to, she said that she thought that the Senior Constable was repeating things that she said in a mocking or sarcastic manner. When pressed further, the plaintiff said that ""Nothing really upset me"" and when pressed as to give an instance of what Senior Constable Barnier may have said that mocked her she said she couldn't really do so off the top of her head. At p 71 Mr Barham is recorded as conceding that he made no complaint about the record of interview other than the plaintiff saying that she was cold. 

28Mr Spartalis visited this issue for a third time, commencing on p 91 of the transcript. That is on the second day of the hearing. The significance of this I shall turn to shortly. On p 92 the following evidence was given:

""Q. You know that when you told his Honour yesterday that you were freezing and shivering in the room, that was untrue as well, don't you?
A. No, that was the truth. I wouldn't have asked for a blanket at the end of the interview if it wasn't cold.

Q. You knew that there was no tremor in your voice during the interview, don't you?
A. There was when I was talking. I could feel it.

Q. In fact you were quite relaxed when you were talking, giving an account of what had occurred.
A. No, I don't believe so.""

The significance of those questions and answers is that the audiovisual recording of the interview was played to the Court on the afternoon of 20 March 2011. That was played to the Court in the absence of the plaintiff who had to return to Grafton to look after her children and grandchildren.

29From p 77 it was clear that when the plaintiff said that she needed to return to Grafton it was 4.10pm. It takes about an hour to motor from Coffs Harbour to Grafton. She would not get to Grafton until 5.10pm and she had to be back in Grafton by 5.30pm. The plaintiff agreed that she had the audio of the electronically recorded interview and she said that she would listen to that at home that evening and the Court then had played to it the audio-visual of the interview which became exhibit 3. In addition to noting some errata between what I could hear on exhibit 3 and what is recorded in the transcript of the interview, which is exhibit D, the following are noted on the transcript at p 79:

""The transcript can show that the plaintiff was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt that appeared to imitate a football jersey, short sleeves, and that each of the three police officers who are seen in the video were all wearing short-sleeved shirts, and I could not see on any occasion anywhere the plaintiff indicate in any way that she was cold.""

On p 80 this interchange is recorded: After referring to a question, 'Okay. There's nothing else you want to say"", which is Q289 , Mr Spartalis asked me to record that the plaintiff was observed to remove her cap, appeared to wipe her face and replace her cap. He submitted that the plaintiff appeared to be moving or wiping sweat from her forehead but he left that for me to determine. I then said that ""I didn't glean anything from that, other than perhaps it was a bit warm for wearing a cap."" There was nothing at all to suggest on viewing the electronically recorded interview that the plaintiff was cold. There is nothing to suggest that the courteousness of Senior Constable Barnier could be questioned in any way. There is no suggestion that he mocked the plaintiff, ridiculed her, made any comment or was sarcastic, and there is nothing to suggest the plaintiff was other than fully at her ease.

30The evidence was given by Senior Constable Barnier that the Grafton Police Station is air-conditioned. The temperature is constant and the police officers walk around wearing short-sleeved shirts. The plaintiff may have asked for a blanket for her use in the cell but whether it was to keep her warm or merely to soften the hardness of the bench or bed in the cell I do not know. I only know what she told me. However the criticisms she made of the conduct of Senior Constable Barnier at the interview are without any foundation whatever, nor can I determine anything about the temperature of the room other than to say that there is no suggestion that anyone was suffering from cold. I am unable to accept the plaintiff's evidence about the interview as being accurate or reliable. 

31The plaintiff said that she then sat in her cell ""for hours"". It would appear that the plaintiff was in her cell for the best part of two hours between 4.44pm and around 7.02pm. That is over two hours. Her evidence then continued thus:

""Q. What was the next thing that happened to you?

A. The next thing was Custody Officer Benfield, I believe - he came in to check on me. He'd just started. He came on duty. When he got to the door I was pretty upset and I was, sort of, having a bit of a - I don't know, anxiety attack. Hyperventilating. I don't know what you'd call it. I was very stressed. Breathing heavy, you know, trying to catch my breath. Just freaking out. I don't know where my daughter was. It was dark outside. That's out of the little window. I could see it was dark and I still had no idea what was going on with my kids. 

Q. What happened then?

A. He, sort of, was a bit concerned and he told me just to take it easy and 'I'll go and find out what's going on and we'll get you out of here'. He then went and must've spoke to the other officers and came back and told me they were still doing the paperwork and he said, 'Look, I'll take you into the custody room and you can - yeah, you can get out of this - you know, get a bit of fresh air and we'll get your, you know, fingerprints and photos done'.

Q. Did that happen?

A. Yes. Then he allowed me to call home and check up on the kids that were at home and find out whether my other daughter had been returned or if they'd call the home phone, but - yeah.

Q. Was there a discussion with Officer Benfield of any sort, about bail?

A. Yes. He asked about bail conditions and I said, 'Look, I'll agree to anything. I just need to get home. I'm, you know, I'm not going anywhere. I will be at court. I just need to get home. I just need to get out of here.'

Q. You were eventually released, of course.

A. Yes.

Q. I take it you don't recall exactly what time it was or do you?

A. I think it was just prior to 8 o'clock when I got home.

Q. How did you find the experience being arrested?

A. Traumatic. Yeah, just very traumatic. I've been through a lot in my life and, just - yeah, that was one of the worst, like, moments. Just watching that sun go down and not knowing where my kids were. It was horrible.

Q. How did you feel about the police defending this matter, the way they have done?

A. I cannot see their defence. They did the wrong thing. I did not raise my voice. I wasn't argumentative. I wasn't in any way difficult. I was doing what they wanted me to do.""

32I do note that Leading Senior Constable Philip Benfield commenced work on 1 May 2011 at 6pm and worked until 6am the following morning. All of that period was overtime, caused by staff shortages. The plaintiff's custodial record indicates that Senior Constable Michael Rheinberger (mistakenly referred to in the transcript as Ryanburger) commenced duty at 6pm on 1 May 2011 and worked until 6.30am the next morning, from the exhibit Q. Exhibit Q records that during that shift, Senior Constable Rheinberger was performing station duties. The plaintiff's custody management record shows Senior Constable Rheinberger commencing as the custody manager for the plaintiff at 6.04pm. That is consistent with Senior Constable Ryan Lynch ceasing duty after a period of overtime and being replaced by Senior Constable Rheinberger on the new shift commencing at 6pm. The same custody management record shows a change of custody manager to Leading Senior Constable Philip Benfield at 7.17pm. However, as I have earlier recorded, the plaintiff was released at 7.18pm. Leading Senior Constable Benfield appears to have been the most senior officer serving at Grafton at any material time as far as this case is concerned. 

33I expect that as a Leading Senior Constable, officer Benfield would have been an Acting Sergeant and officer in charge of Grafton Police Station pro tempore. The inference I drew from the evidence given by the plaintiff that I have just cited is that shortly after Leading Senior Constable Benfield came on duty at 6pm he would have visited those in custody and received the concerns voiced by the plaintiff and set in train the motions which eventually led to the behaviour described by the plaintiff and her release at 7.18pm.

34The plaintiff said in her evidence-in-chief that she was told at the end of the interview that she will be charged with both assault and affray. Senior Constable Barnier told the plaintiff the time of her arrest that she is under arrest for affray. The only charge that the plaintiff was given on 1 May 2011 was the charge of affray. That is the only charge contained in the Court Attendance Notice printed out at 7.02pm on 1 May 2011. There is a second Court Attendance Notice, exhibit L, which contains two charges. However that Court Attendance Notice was printed out on 1 November 2011 at 11.04am. That Court Attendance Notice was returnable before the Local Court at Grafton on that very day but at 9.30am. It would appear that the decision to charge the plaintiff with assault was made only on or shortly before 1 November 2011 and perhaps results from a letter from the plaintiff's solicitors to the Commander of the Grafton LAC bearing date 10 August 2011 offering to plead guilty to a charge of common assault if the charge of affray was withdrawn. The sequence 2 charge on the court attendance notice printed on 1 November 2011 is for of common assault on Peter Travers. On 1 November 2011 the charge of affray was withdrawn. The plaintiff did plead guilty to common assault on Peter Travers. The plaintiff was fined $550 and ordered to enter into a bond pursuant to s 9 to be of good behaviour for 12 months. I cannot accept the plaintiff's assertion that she was told at the end of the interview that she was being charged with both assault and affray. She was merely charged with affray and no-one had any reason to tell her at that time that she was being charged with assault. Furthermore, the particulars of the affray would encompass an assault upon Peter Travers and the two charges could not run concurrently: one could only be a back-up charge. 

Cross-examination of the plaintiff

35A number of matters were explored in cross-examination of the plaintiff and some of those I have already averted to. The first thing to note is that the first document adduced into evidence in the plaintiff's case was three pages of Facebook entries made by Peter Travers. The Facebook entries were posted on Anzac Day 2011. One generated at 11.37 shows a group of people with this caption ""On z piss at the coutts pub... oh ..."". Another generated at 11.43am was made by Ash Bancroft who asked Mr Travers with whom he was. The reply given by Mr Travers nominates eight persons and notes that they were playing the game of two-up, the traditional activity on Anzac Day. At about a half hour later a Facebook entry invites Ash Bancroft to join Mr Travers at the Coutts Crossing Tavern. At 12.24pm Mr Travers posted this ""Playing up like a second-hand lawn mower"". That would certainly seem to indicate that Mr Travers was behaving mischievously at least. Other Facebook entries were posted on the following day, 26 April, commencing at 7.40am. They discussed an altercation in which Mr Travers was engaged on the evening of Anzac Day. At 8.23am Mr Travers posted an entry which contains this matter ""Nah mate. I'm fine ey. Couple of cuts and grazes. lol... all just good fun really..."". At 10.55am Mr Travers posted a note which indicates that he was still fairly hung-over. Those Facebook entries were printed off by the plaintiff on 26 April 2011 when she became aware, she asked me to believe, of the extent of the interaction between Mr Peter Travers and Mr David Daley.

36Commencing on p 94 Mr Spartalis commenced cross-examining the plaintiff about her reasons for printing out the Facebook entries. At the foot of that page this evidence commenced,

""Q. Did you search it because you were very cranky about what happened?

A. No, I searched it because I wanted to copy and paste it because it may have come in handy.

Q. What, in case someone wanted to go around to his address?

A. No. In case it came to something like this, or in case I needed it in case I was going to get charged or just in case.""

I interpolate that that suggests that as at 26 April 2011, the plaintiff clearly had in her contemplation that it was possible that she could be criminally charged for what were injuries sustained by Peter Travers and the reason for printing out the Facebook entries was to make sure that he was not seriously injured and in fact was laughing off or minimising the extent of what had happened to him on the evening of Anzac Day 2011. However the questioning then continued thus:

Q. How does it help you with this case, can you tell his Honour?

A. It may not. I don't know. I didn't expect this was going to happen, because I didn't expect the police to treat me the way they did. I would never have expected to be treated that way. I'm not a menace to society. I'm not somebody who they pick up on a regular basis. Therefore I would have expected to be treated with slightly a bit more compassion I suppose.

Of course, the protestation that she didn't expect ""this"" was going to happen is inconsistent with what she had just said. If she perceived that she might be charged she would perceive that she would have some interaction with the police. However, the extent of the last answer amounts, in my view, to pure self advocacy by the plaintiff. She was unresponsively protesting that she had been ill dealt with by the police and that she ought not to have been dealt with in the way that she was, and that she ought to have been dealt with ""more compassionately"", meaning, I suppose, that she should not have been charged with any criminal offence. The hard fact is, however, that she printed off the Facebook entries in case anything were to happen, that is, in case she and perhaps her partner, David Daley, would be charged for what had happened to Peter Travers at the Coutts Crossing Tavern on the evening of Anzac Day. 

37There is, also arising from cross-examination and other evidence, an issue as to timing of the events at the Coutts Crossing Tavern, and therefore the reliability of the plaintiff's evidence. I have earlier recorded the evidence of the plaintiff in chief that as soon as she had spoken to police at the tavern she obtained the hot chips from over the bar and headed back to Lakkari Street in order to give the children their dinner and to continue having some further alcoholic beverages. In the electronically recorded interview , Q209 followed upon an adverse description of the Coutts Crossing Tavern given by the plaintiff. The question and answer recorded are this:

""Q209. If the, if the hotel's that bad, like, why go to it though?

A. Well, we only really went to get chips for the kids. We thought we'd have two beers. Three beers which we wait for the chips to cook, 'cause they don't start till 6 o'clock cooking. So, we thought, you know just to have a bit of peace away from the kids for an hour we'd sit down there, have a couple, then order chips and go home.""

In cross-examination at p 97 the plaintiff confirmed that she had already told me that the fight between Mr Travers and Mr David Daley occurred while she was waiting for the chips to cook. She also confirmed that that must have been after 6 o'clock because the kitchen only opened at 6pm. The plaintiff was asked whether she had hung around after the fight to obtain the chips and she said that she had, and the plaintiff said that she was only at the hotel for ""two or three minutes because the chips were already ready.""

38It is difficult to know whether that meant that she hung around for two or three minutes after ordering the chips or for two or three minutes after speaking to the police, however earlier the plaintiff said, at the foot of p 47, that she left the hotel ""after 6pm"". She confirmed that she had ordered chips for the kids to take home. She agreed about the kitchen only opened at 6pm and that the fight happened after she had ordered the chips.

39However, an undisputable objective fact is that a CIDS broadcast was made at 6.01pm on 25 April 2011 by a private citizen phoning on a landline to 000 with information that six persons, both male and female, were fighting at the Coutts Crossing Tavern. The incident is referred to as a ""brawl"" and I shall hereafter use that expression because it has no particular legal significance and because it is used both in documents and used by witnesses to describe what actually occurred at the Coutts Crossing Tavern early in the evening of Anzac Day 2011. 

40It is clear from exhibit 4, the COPS event entry, that the police only arrived at the Coutts Crossing Tavern at 6.15pm and that the plaintiff was still at the tavern at that time. The brawl may have occurred between the plaintiff's ordering hot chips at 6pm and picking them up after speaking to the police very shortly after 6.15. However the period involved appears to have been at least a quarter of an hour and not a few fleeting minutes as the plaintiff would have me believe. Indeed, this was eventually put by Mr Spartalis to the plaintiff commencing at the foot of p 99. This evidence was given:

""Q. The evidence you gave earlier about being at the pub for two minutes after the kitchen opened is wrong as well isn't it?

A. I beg your pardon?

Q. You gave evidence a moment ago that the kitchen opened at 6pm, you got the chips and two minutes later you were out of there. 

A. I said that I'd ordered the chips, and the chips were ready by the time the police got there. I spoke to the police then I went and collected the chips. I don't know exact times. This was like, nearly two years ago. I'm unsure of the exact time I ordered the chips or picked the chips up.

Q. I just put this to you squarely. You spoke to Senior Constable Barnier at 6.15 on 25 April 2011.

A. If that's what you're saying. I can't confirm or deny that. I don't know what time it was when I spoke to an officer and I do not recollect if it was that exact officer, but I did speak to an officer and the chips were ready at that point because I picked them up as soon as I spoke to the officer and gave him my details.""

Of course when pressed with objective evidence, the plaintiff is prepared to back away but again it does suggest that her evidence is not reliable or accurate.

LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT

41Another factor to bear in mind when considering the evidence of the plaintiff, especially the evidence that she gave about what happened at the Coutts Crossing Tavern, is to consider the state of her sobriety at that time. She was asked questions about her alcohol consumption when interviewed by Senior Constable Barnier on 1 May 2011. The plaintiff said that before she went into the hotel, that is between about 4 and 4.30, she had three stubbies of Tooheys New beer. At the tavern she had three schooners of Tooheys New beer and four nips of Stone's Green Ginger Wine. She admitted that she was ""probably a bit tipsy"" or ""slightly tipsy"". All told, that would have amounted to 13.3 standard drinks over a period of some two hours. That is discussed at p 34 of the transcript. Although the plaintiff herself said that she was ""slightly tipsy"", the standard of her inebriation may have been much greater and therefore her ability to remember what actually happened at the Coutts Crossing Tavern on the evening of Anzac Day might not be good and her memory of what was to happen later in the evening might also not be good.

42The plaintiff said that after leaving the Coutts Crossing Tavern she returned to 18 Lakkari Street, Coutts Crossing, and there were present there Ms Cindy Wilson, Ms Amber Murphy and her husband Mr.Tony Murphy, Natasha Wilson, the daughter of Cindy Wilson, and her boyfriend Mr Gary Brush, and other evidence also says that Ms Samantha Polley was also present. When cross-examined about the interaction of the plaintiff and the police at 18 Lakkari Street, when they called there looking for David Daley, the plaintiff admitted that she ""probably did yell at them a little bit"" and that she ""probably would have [sworn] a couple of times"", and this question and answer were then put:

""Q. What about this? 'You're all fucked. We're looking to - we're going to fuckin' sue. The ombudsman will have your fuckin' jobs.' What about that?

A. Yeah. I probably wouldn't have said the F-word that many times because I don't really say it that many times.""

43On 8 June 2002 the plaintiff had been arrested for the offence of offensive language. For that offence she was eventually fined $200 by the Local Court at Grafton. The COPS entry for that offence is in evidence. It is indicative of the language that the plaintiff might use when intoxicated. The narrative contained in the COPS entry for that charge is this:

""About 2am on Saturday 8 June 2002, police were performing foot patrols of the corner of Prince and Pound Street, Grafton in an effort to disperse a large crowd after the closing of nearby licensed premises.

At this time police had cause to arrest a female by the name of Scaybrook, a friend of the defendant.

Whilst police were arresting Scaybrook the defendant continually yelled verbal abuse towards police saying words like 'What are youse locking up a female for you fuckin' cunts. Youse are nothing but fuckin' cunts. Fuck youse.' Police cautioned the defendant about her use of offensive language and a short time later left the area.

About 15 minutes later police were patrolling when they were noticed [sic] the defendant and another female involved in a verbal argument. Although police were approximately 50 m away in a moving vehicle police could clearly hear the defendant yell, 'fuck you, you're a fuckin' white cunt. How many of youse will it fuckin' take to have ya's.' At this time a scuffle broke out between the defendant and several other people.

Police intervened in an attempt to stop the imminent brawl. The defendant turned to police and said, 'Youse never fucking help us out, you fucking cunts.' The defendant was then again cautioned about the use of offensive language.

As police calmed the situation down the defendant continually enraged the group, at one time attempting to physically attack another person, speaking to police.

At this time the defendant lashed out yelling 'You fuckin' racist slut, you fuckin' cunt, try to fight a 15-year-old will ya, ya slut.' 

Police then took hold of the defendant's arms and informed her she was under arrest. She was cautioned, to which she stated, 'I know, fuck youse.' 

The defendant was then conveyed to Grafton Police Station where she was issued a field Court Attendance Notice for the matters now before the court.

At the time of the incident the defendant was moderately affected by intoxicating liquor.""

I have, when quoting it, not commented upon the egregious errors of spelling made by Constable Wiles, who compiled the narrative. 

44It is also clear from the verbiage used by the plaintiff, when interviewed by the police on 1 November 2011, that even when sober the plaintiff is prone to using foul language. It appears to me to be more probable that the version of events to which Senior Constable Barnier was to depose as happening at 18 Lakkari Street, Coutts Crossing, is the more accurate and reliable version. I turn now to his evidence. 

Onus of proof of lawful arrest

45Before doing so I should probably state the obvious as to the onus of proof. These are civil proceedings. The onus of proof of the plaintiff's cause of action obviously lies with the plaintiff. However, the burden of a proof when the police arrest a person falls upon the police. In Zaravinos v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 320; (2004) 62 NSWLR 58, Bryson JA, with whom Santow JA and Adams J concurred, said commencing at [37] this:

""In the present case the burden of proof that the arrest and detention were lawful fell on the defendants under the defence of justification which was attributed to them. Even if the circumstances mentioned in s 352(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 exists, the lawfulness of the arrests of Mr Zaravinos are examinable, and the arrests were not lawful unless each decision to arrest was made in good faith and for the purposes for which the power to arrest exists, that is the purposes of bringing the person arrested before a justice and conducting a prosecution; and not for some extraneous purpose. Arresting a person for the purpose of questioning him and investigating the circumstances of the suspected offence or any other offence is arrest for an extraneous purpose. It is even more clearly an extraneous purpose to arrest a person as a piece of unnecessary, high-handed and humiliating behaviour in the circumstances in which arrest is not reasonably necessary for the effective conduct of a prosecution. The availability of information and summons as an alternative course, and the considerations favouring and adverse to the taking of that alternative course, are relevant where the validity of the exercise of the power to arrest is in question.

Whether or not the arrests themselves were lawful, the burden of proof of the lawfulness of the continuance of detention throughout the period rested on the defendants.""

Section 352(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 has been replaced by s 99(2) of LEPRA. The dictum which I have quoted remain applicable to an arrest governed by s 99 of LEPRA. 

46Incidentally, I should mention that Mr Barham, who appeared for the plaintiff, made submissions to me about the meaning of ""good faith"". ""Good faith"" is not a term used in s 99 of LEPRA. The requirement that an arrest be carried out in good faith represents a judicial gloss. Mr Barham referred me to the judgment of Kirby J in Cannane v J Cannane Pty Limited [1998] HCA26; (1998) 192 CLR557. In that case Kirby J discussed at [101] the meaning of the term ""in good faith"", but that, of course, was a term used in s 121(1) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 which was the subject of the consideration of the High Court. Dicta about words used in a statutory context cannot be applied literally to the same words used as a judicial gloss by judges speaking of the requirements of an Act which do not use that term. Clearly, in the dictum which I have quoted from Bryson JA above, his Honour used the words ""in good faith"" in contradistinction to an arrest being made for some ulterior or extraneous purpose.

Senior Constable Barnier's evidence

47Senior Constable Peter Barnier was attested as a probationary constable of police in 1999. He initially saw service in Sydney. In about 2009 he was posted to Grafton. On Anzac Day 2011 he commenced his shift at 6pm. He was working with two probationary constables, Probationary Constable George Chakty and Probationary Constable Andrew Jeffrey. As I have previously mentioned, the CIDS incident was broadcast at 6.01pm. Senior Constable Barnier and the two probationary constables were assigned to the police car known as Grafton 25. I have earlier referred to the CIDS message. Grafton 5 responded to the call. It is clear from the COPS event entry and from Senior Constable Barnier's notebook, exhibit 7, that they arrived at the Coutts Crossing Tavern at 6.15pm. They drove there with lights flashing and sirens sounding.

48The Senior Constable said this about what he observed:

""I observed a number of people. People were starting to leave. We started speaking to witnesses there and at that time we identified a crime scene which we proceeded to basically keep people out of. I started obtaining witness details as people were leaving, I made a number of inquiries, a number of entries in my notebook for witnesses.""

The copy of the Senior Constable's notebook for this attendance was then put into evidence. He went on to say that he was shown where the brawl had occurred and he saw blood. He saw a white parked utility in the car park of the tavern and there was blood on it. He said he also saw a blood trail leading away from the crime scene. He also saw that there was broken glass there. Eventually colour photographs were put into evidence and they became exhibit 19, showing blood on the Nissan utility, on the surface of the car park and a blood trail along the front verandah of the tavern, as well as pieces of broken glass.

49The first witness details recorded by the Senior Constable in his notebook were the details of the plaintiff. This evidence was given:

""You've identified her there as a witness. Why have you done that?

A. She was about to leave. So before she left, I thought she might have been a material witness. So I wanted to get her details before she left the scene.

Q. How would you describe her at that time?
A. Intoxicated. She just wanted to go home. She didn't really want to give her details, but basically I said, 'Look, it's a serious matter. I need your name and address and phone number.'""

The inference to be drawn from that evidence itself is that she was reluctant to give her details because she wanted to leave. 

50 However, that led to some unnecessary cross-examination. That unnecessary cross-examination commences at p 187 line 30 and continues to p 188 line 40. The cross-examiner believed that the witness had indicated that she was reluctant to give her evidence because she did not want to be a witness, rather than that she was reluctant to give her details because she wanted to go home. It is clear from the evidence given by the Senior Constable that he only meant that the witness was reluctant to give her details because of her desire to leave, not because of any obstruction on her part.

51The witness was then directed to what he was told about what had happened in the brawl in order to ascertain how serious he thought the incident may have been. The Senior Constable said that he had been told by Mr Watson and his wife that there had been a ""glassing"". He said that Mr Watson had told him that a man had been glassed ""to the head"". Mr Watson believed that the person who was injured had had serious injuries and had been ""rushed to hospital"". He had been informed that the injured person was Mr Peter Travers. He also was told by Mr Watson that the person responsible for the ""glassing"" was Mr David Daley. When asked whether he observed anything about Mr Watson, the Senior Constable said this:

""He was pale. He was sort of like puffing and panting. He had a sweaty complexion. He was soiled. He had blood on his shirt. He looked quite stressed and shocked really."" 

Exhibit 19 contains two photographs of Mr Watson taken on 25 April, showing his upper body and in particular blood stains on his basically white shirt. One of the photographs does show Mr Watson as ""goggle-eyed"" but that might be a photographic effect and cannot be taken to represent his physical condition at the time he was photographed. However, from what the Senior Constable did say, it would appear that the ""brawl"" had only recently ended.

52The Senior Constable also spoke to Ms Kim Watson. She gave him the same information as her husband. The Senior Constable described her as ""pale, hyperventilating and really breathing hard"". He also said that she said that what she had witnessed was one of the most violent things she had ever seen. According to the Senior Constable the witness, that is Kim Watson, looked ""fearful"". Both Mr Fred Watson and Ms Kim Watson told the Senior Constable that they did not want David Daley to return to the tavern again.

53After observing the crime scene and taking notes about the alleged victim and the alleged offender and other details, Senior Constable Barnier spoke to his supervisor, Senior Constable Richard Beresford, who was the acting sergeant. He asked that a detective be assigned and he pointed out that he had established a crime scene. He also requested the attendance of crime scene officers. Detective King arrived at the scene about 7.30pm or a little bit before. A crime scene guard was appointed. That initially was Probationary Constable Chakty. Detective King suggested that he knew where to go to try to find David Daley. Detective King led the Senior Constable and Probationary Constable Jeffrey to 18 Lakkari Street, Coutts Crossing. This evidence was then given:

""We went to the front door, knocked on the front door. There's no answer. It appeared locked. But we could hear voices coming from the background, like, as if there was a party coming out from the backyard. So Detective King, myself and Andrew Jeffrey walked around the back. As soon as we've gone - it's like there's a side gate, just like going through the gate, and there is quite a number of persons on like a back decking to do with the house. As soon as we walked in, Detective King said - basically introduced himself, 'We're the police'. As he was speaking a woman 'jumped up from the table, and ran straight into the back door of the house. Detective King followed. I also followed. We went into the house and started searching the house, believing that Dave Daley was inside.""

54It was then made known that the woman who had got up and run inside was not the plaintiff but Ms Natasha Wilson, the daughter of the householder Cindy Wilson. He said that then the plaintiff started yelling at the police. He went on to say this:

""A. Said, 'You fucking pigs. You can't come in here. The fucking ombudsman is going to hear about this. I'm going to fucking sue. I'm going to have your fucking jobs for this.' She was - she came right up to our faces, she was waving her finger at us, pointing.""

There was then demonstrated a distance of about 30 centimetres between the police and the pointing finger. The Senior Constable went on to say this:
""A. Detective King and myself and Andrew Jeffrey continued quickly searching the house. The plaintiff basically continued the same sort of verbal abuse, 'Fucking pigs. Get out. You fucking need a warrant'. At this stage I think Detective King noticed the front door was wide open, and he's gone out the front door and basically - I think there was another gentleman there by the name of Gary Brush on the front and, yeah, there was no sign of Mr Daley.

Q. So how would you describe the plaintiff's demeanour at that time?
A. She was the most aggressive female there. She was very, very angry. She was just yelling at the top of her voice almost to the point of screaming, and I felt we had to leave, otherwise she's probably going to assault us. It was that bad.

Q. How did that make you feel by the way?
A. Basically I wanted to just leave. I just thought, you know, 'Detective King, it's time to go. We've searched the house. Let's just get out of here.'

Q. Were you concerned that something was going to happen?
A. Yeah. If we stayed there something would have happened. I found it odd at the time because her being the most aggressive there and she didn't live there. Like, I could have understood it if she was the owner of the house, but - yeah.""

He then pointed out that the plaintiff was still intoxicated. 

55The police then returned to the Coutts Crossing Tavern and Detective King had a brief conversation with Mr and Ms Watson and Mr Desmond Watson, the father of Mr Brett Watson, and then Senior Constable Barnier returned with other police to the Grafton Police Station. 

56On the way to the Grafton Police Station they went to the plaintiff's address, 73 Oliver Street, Grafton. They were looking for David Daley. Having been informed that David Daley was the partner of the plaintiff, they thought it prudent to search for him at the plaintiff's residence, which she had disclosed when giving her details. Senior Constable Barnier said that the police knocked at the front and rear doors of the plaintiff's house and walked around it to see if anyone could be seen through the windows of the house. No-one could be seen and the house was in darkness. So, after spending some five or ten minutes at the house, they returned to the Grafton Police Station, where Mr and Ms Watson and Mr Desmond Watson were either then present or about to arrive in order to make statements. Detective Senior Constable Barnier took statements from Mr Desmond Watson and also from Mr Brett Watson. Probationary Constable Jeffrey took a statement from Ms Kim Watson.

57On the following evening, 26 April, Senior Constable Barnier took a statement from Ms Nadine Close and also electronically interviewed Mr Peter Travers. After conducting those interviews, the Senior Constable decided that he would arrest the plaintiff. Accordingly, the initial decision to arrest was based only upon what was conveyed to Senior Constable Barnier by Mr Brett Watson, Mr Desmond Watson, Ms Kim Watson, Ms Nadine Close and Peter Travers. Information he actually obtained after that time is relevant only to the issue of whether the Senior Constable should have changed his mind, and perhaps, is relevant to whether it reinforced in him the initial determination to make the arrest. However, whether the Senior Constable had reasonable grounds to suspect that it was necessary to arrest the plaintiff to prevent the intimidation of or interference with witnesses must be determined at the time he made the initial decision. It is important, therefore, to know what information was available to the Senior Constable at the time he made the decision to arrest, either after interviewing or reading the statements of the five witnesses who had then provided statements to the police.

Information available when the decision was made to arrest the plaintiff

58The first statement to which I should refer is a statement of Mr Brett Watson. At the time of making the statement he had been the licensee at the Coutts Crossing Tavern for ten years. The statement says this:

""4. On Monday the 25th of April 2011, we were open for Anzac Day and we were running two up from about 1:00pm to 5.45pm. Everyone was having a great day and I was running the bar and running the courtesy bus. About 5.30pm, I returned from a trip with the courtesy bus and Kim Watson, my partner, told me that there was a problem with Peter [Travers]. She told me she had refused service to him as he was intoxicated. Kim told me he was not aggressive, but he was intoxicated and had to leave.

5. I observed Peter for a while and a short time later, I then saw Peter speaking to a fellow whom I know as Dave Daley. Dave was wearing a red t-shirt and a pair of dark shorts. Dave could be described as Aboriginal complexion, about 180 cm and of solid build. Dave would be about 30 years old. I've known Dave for three to four years and I know Dave goes out with Melissa Tilse. Dave and Melissa used to reside together in Coutts Crossing, but I think they have now left the local area. I have had trouble with Dave before where he is aggressive and has thrown a glass at the hotel about a year and a half ago. He's been barred from the hotel before for this behaviour.

6. When I saw Peter and Dave having a heated conversation together I suspected trouble. Both Dave and Peter were at the front of the hotel at this time and I walked over to them to try and separate them and settle them down.

7. Both Peter and Dave were arguing about silly stuff. I asked them to quieten down, but they wouldn't. I then asked them to come around to the side of the hotel and have a quite chat together so that they would calm down. I also thought that if something did happen, that their behaviour would not disturb the other patrons as I was concerned for the customers' safety.

8. The friends of both then came over to where we were and I tried to push the crowd back so that they would not get involved. I asked both of the men to cut out their behaviour because I didn't want innocent people hurt and there were families and children there.

9. I think Peter said, 'Do you want a go?' 

10. Dave said, 'Yeah, I'll have a go'.

11. Dave didn't muck around and I'm pretty sure Dave hit Peter first using a good right hand closed fist. Peter retaliated and they both traded punches. I stepped back out of the way as they were throwing punches as both boys were about 100 kgs each and quite solid. They went toe to toe for a while with both boys exchanging punches and hitting each other. Dave got the better of Peter and Peter ended up on the ground and hit his head quite hard on the grass with Dave on top of him. I tried to break up the fight and I got them apart with help from other people around. Peter was still aggressive and wanted to continue the fight. Both boys then exchanged punches again with Peter being the main aggressor. Dave was a better fighter and Peter ended up on the ground again with Dave on top of Peter.

12. I tried to break the fight up again and some other people helped me. There was a lot going on and there were other people involved in the fight as well. I managed to separate both parties again and I had hold of Peter and Peter broke my hold and ran over to Dave and punched Dave to the left side of his face. All through the fighting there were voices yelling, 'Hit the dog' , 'Knock him out'. There were both female and male voices. Peter's girlfriend, Nadine Close, was trying to get Peter out of there and into the car to leave. Dave's partner, Melissa Tilse, was [egging] Dave on and was the most aggressive female there. She was yelling, 'Fucking hit him, he's a dog.' 

13. Both boys began punching each other again and the fight has ended up near a white utility. Peter was up against the ute and Peter was getting a flogging. Dave was just pounding Peter with punches to the face and must [have] punched him five to six times. I pulled Dave from Peter and things began to settle down. I have managed to push Dave back to the grassed area near the hotel and I went back to see if Peter was alright. At this time I noticed someone had given Peter a drink in a seven Oz. I took this off Peter and then I was trying to get Peter out of there. I then heard my wife yelling out, 'Dave's got a glass, Dave's got a glass'.

14. I moved in Dave's direction to try and get the glass off him. I noticed he was holding a seven Oz glass in his left hand. He was holding the glass in a clenched fist. It was [as] if he was about to hit something with it. He was not holding it as if he was going to drink out of it. I said, 'Dave, give me the glass.' 

15. I tried to grab the glass from his left hand, but he flicked his wrist as I grabbed him and I lost my grip. Dave was marching across to Peter and Peter was still on his haunches. Peter was squatting down and did not see Dave approaching. Dave then smashed the seven Oz glass over the back of Peter's head. The glass smashed instantly and made a loud crash and I saw pieces of glass go everywhere. Moments later I noticed a lot of blood trickling down Peter's neck. I went over to try and get Peter into his girlfriend's car. We had trouble getting Peter into the car as he was argumentative and refusing to leave. We finally got him into the car with his girlfriend driving. As his girlfriend drove off, Peter tried to get out of the car and all of Peter's mates were trying to push him back in. I opened the driver's side door and got his girlfriend out and she got in the back and I got in the driver's side. I then drove Peter to Kangaroo Creek Road and he settled down. I stopped the car and I asked Peter to get out of the car and I had a look at Peter's head in the headlights.

16. I saw a four centimetre cut on the back of his neck just in his hairline and another cut what looked like at the top of his head. There was a lot of blood. I told Peter and his girlfriend, Nadine Close, to go to the hospital and report it to the Police. I then drove back to the Coutts Crossing shop and got out. I did not see Dave when I got back. Police had then arrived a short time later. I gave police details where Dave may [have] went [sic]. I showed Detective King the house where I believed Dave and Melissa Tilse would [have] gone and where I believed he would be staying."" 

I have quoted that extensively to give some substantial background to the event that occurred at the Coutts Crossing hotel on the evening of Anzac Day 2011. 

59In his oral evidence Senior Constable Barnier gave evidence about fears expressed to him by both Brett Watson, Kim Watson, Nadine Close and others. There was then a substantial disagreement between counsel as to the significance of that evidence and, although it was admissible not as to truth of the contents but only as to what was conveyed to Senior Constable Barnier, learned counsel for the plaintiff made it quite clear that he did not accept the veracity of what the Senior Constable had said. To try to solve the dilemma I needed to make certain interlocutory orders.

The orders that I made on 9 August 2013 contain these:

""If the defendant is to adduce any further lay evidence, an affidavit of any such lay witness giving his or her evidence-in-chief is to be made and a copy of it or them is to be served upon the plaintiff's solicitor and counsel by 4pm on Friday 18 October 2013.

Noted: The witnesses concerned are Ms Nadine Close, Mr Brett Watson, Ms Kim Watson.

If any such affidavit be served, plaintiff is to give notice to the defendant's solicitor by 4pm on 1 November 2013 that the witness or witnesses is/are required for cross-examination."" 

Pursuant to that direction, the defendant served affidavits from Brett Watson sworn 18 October 2013 and Kim Watson sworn 18 October 2013 and also from the defendant's solicitor, Ms Kate Dobbie, sworn 17 October 2013, concerning attempts to obtain an affidavit from Nadine Close. The affidavits in question were served upon the plaintiff in accordance with the orders I made.

The plaintiff's solicitor did not serve notice that the witnesses were required for cross-examination until two days before the scheduled resumption of the hearing, on 5 December. That was insufficient time to obtain the attendance at Court of two witnesses from the Coutts Crossing Tavern, eighteen kilometres south of Grafton, especially when they were the licensee and the licensee's wife. The plaintiff's solicitor by his conduct waived the right to cross-examine.

60Mr Barham, for the plaintiff, made an application that I take evidence from Mr and Ms Watson by video link and he accepted that, if it were only put to them that what they said was incorrect, that they would probably merely reply that what they did say was correct, and he merely wanted to put those formal propositions to the witnesses to avoid any submissions under Browne v Dunn. Either video or telephone link. The problem then arose that my courtroom is not designed for either video or telephone link. It would be necessary to obtain another courtroom and courtrooms in the District Court are at a premium on Fridays because of the substantial criminal listings on that day, and because Fridays is motion days in the civil list: there are generally more judges available than there are courtrooms. However, I accept no Browne v Dunn point can be taken.

61Mr Brett Watson, in his affidavit, said that he had a conversation with Senior Constable Barnier to the following effect:

""Me: 'They're [Melissa Tilse and David Daley] are troublemakers. They've caused me trouble before.' 

Barnier: 'What've they done?' 

Me: 'They've both been argumentative in the hotel with other patrons and have started fights. After what they've done, I don't want them back in the hotel ever again. What happens if they come back and cause us trouble?' 

Barnier: 'Call us if they do and we'll come immediately. We won't let them get away with it'.

Me: 'I'm worried about my patrons. They could ruin my hotel's reputation. How do I protect my family and my business from them? They're the type that will come back and harass us.' 

Barnier: 'Look, it's a serious offence to intimidate witnesses. Bail conditions can [be] imposed that will keep them away from you and the tavern. That will provide you with some protection.'""

62The statement of Kim Watson obtained by Probationary Constable Jeffrey sets out her version of this brawl and of the main actors in the brawl, being ""Peter"" and ""Dave"". Par 5 of that statement is this:

""About 20 minutes later [after about 5.30] a female came to the bar and told me that there was a fight happening in the car park. I went out and saw people everywhere punching and kicking. There were about 15 people in the area at the time trying to stop the fight that was happening. This happened for around 2-3 minutes trying to stop the fight. I saw a couple of girls arguing with each other and I turned one to the side to get them to leave. I remember seeing one woman kicking a fellow whilst on the ground."" 

She went on to describe the ""glassing"" of Peter by Dave and provided a description of Dave consistent with her husband's description of David Daley. Pars 7 and 8 of her affidavit of 18 October 2013, which is exhibit 26, are these:

""7. Later on the evening of 25 April 2011 Brett and I attended Grafton Police Station to be interviewed by police. I met with Senior Constable Barnier. He told me that he wanted me to be a witness and he wanted me to give a signed statement about the fight.

8. Before I was interviewed about the altercation, I had a conversation to the following effect with Senior Constable Barnier: 

Me: 'This is the most violent attack I've ever seen. Someone could have died there tonight. I can't believe it happened. I know what Melissa and Dave are like. If they know we've helped you they will come back and cause trouble. We are going to have to sell the business and move north. I'm going to convince Brett to sell the hotel so we never have to go back there. I can't bear this if it happens again. What happens if they return? Melissa's a spiteful woman and she holds a grudge. She uses standover tactics. How do we protect ourselves?'

Barnier: 'Kim, it's a serious offence to intimidate witnesses. I'll try and get bail conditions imposed. They will keep them away from you and the tavern. That will provide you with the protection and if there's any trouble you call us and we'll come straight out.'""

In par 10 of her affidavit Kim Wilson said that at the time she made her statement she was anxious and distressed and was not thinking clearly. She went on to say this:

""The woman I saw kicking the man on the ground and who I was referring to was Melissa Tilse. I was reluctant to identify Melissa Tilse at the time that I made my statement.""

63Of course, that was not known to Senior Constable Barnier at the time he made his decision to arrest the plaintiff. However, there was other evidence before him that a person who had kicked Peter Travers when he was on the ground was Melissa Tilse and it was open to the Senior Constable to infer from that evidence that the woman seen kicking the fellow on the ground may well have been Melissa Tilse.

64In her statement made to Senior Constable Barnier on 26 April 2011 Nadine Close said in par 8 this:

""8. At this time Peter was on the ground and I saw Melissa Tilse kicking Peter to the body. She kicked Peter at least three times. I ran back over to help Peter and I grabbed Melissa Tilse by the back of the head to stop her from kicking Peter. I yanked her back and Melissa said something to me and then punched me to the left cheek. She punched me with a closed fist. One of my friends, Kayla Horne, pushed Melissa out of the way so she would not punch me again. I know Melissa Tilse as I went to school with her brother and I know her parents well enough to have a chat and I have been in their house when I was in my teenage years. I have seen Melissa around town over the years. I looked over to where Peter was and he was on the ground and was bleeding from the back of the head."" 

In the following paragraph of her statement Ms Close referred to the actions of, amongst others, Melissa Tilse as ""dog shots"". 

The affidavit of Ms Dobbie, to which I have earlier referred, refers to her making contact with Nadine Close on 11 October 2013 when she expressed her willingness to provide an affidavit about how she felt after the incident at Coutts Crossing Tavern. However, Ms Dobbie's attempts to contact the witness at 9.30am on 15 October, 6.15pm on 15 October and 4pm on 17 October were unsuccessful. At the time Ms Dobbie swore her affidavit on 17 October she had not been able to obtain an affidavit from Ms Close to finalise her evidence. Clearly no such affidavit was provided prior to 18 October 2013, which was the last time at which any such affidavit was to be served.

65The evidence given by Senior Constable Barnier as to Nadine Close's fears can be found in a number of places. In chief at p 139 the Senior Constable said that she said words to the effect that she was ""frightened"". He went on to say this:

""She basically said words to the effect that she knows the plaintiff through living at the small community of Coutts Crossing. The plaintiff knows her car. She believed she knew her rego. She went to school with I think the plaintiff's brother. They had a similar sort of like social circle. She went to TAFE, as did the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's friends. She said basically words to the effect of the plaintiff will seek revenge if she finds out I made this statement.""

In cross-examination on 21 March at p 216, the Senior Constable confirmed that Nadine Close feared for retribution, that as far as he knew Nadine Close was in a relationship with Peter Travers, that they in fact were a couple and that if, for example, they wished to continue this altercation with Travers, Close could easily become involved again because she lived with Travers. Those questions in cross-examination were asked by me. In cross-examination by Mr Barham the Senior Constable confirmed what I have earlier said and then continued thus:

""Q. You see, if Nadine Close had indicated to you that she feared for her life, that is a very serious matter, isn't it?

A. It is.

Q. Mm, and it's something that if she had in fact said those words you would have made a note of it somewhere, wouldn't you?

A. For the criminal proceedings it is not relevant.

Q. Part of the criminal proceedings was bail, was it not, in your eyes?"" 

66There was then the usual, or one could say well anticipated, interjection by Mr Spartalis and discussion between the Bench and Bar table and the evidence continued thus:

""Q. Indeed if a threat of that severity had been made you would have made a note of it wouldn't you?

A. No.

Q. No, right. I suggest to you, sir, that Ms Close did not say those words to you or you would have made a note of it.

A. I can tell you she did and, unfortunately, I did not make a note of it.

Q. You would not make a note of any of the words that Brett Watson said to you which you gave evidence about yesterday?

A. No, I did not make a note of that either because I did not think it was relevant.""

67My other note of evidence given by Senior Constable Barnier concerning Nadine Close's fears refers to evidence commencing at the foot of p 140. That evidence is:

""Q. I didn't ask you this. When Nadine Close expressed her concerns, did you say anything to her?

A. I said basically the same thing. I said, 'Look, Peter is the true victim here.' She said, 'I agree, he could have been killed'. She was quite timid. She really didn't want to give a statement. She just didn't really want any involvement because she was frightened of retribution. I used the same, similar words to what I said to Peter. 'Look, it's a serious offence to intimidate a witness and there's - there's ways we can protect you.'""

68The reference by Mr Barham to the witness' fearing for her life was his picking up an answer recorded on p 220 line 13 where Senior Constable Barnier said this:

""She said words to the effect of, 'I'm frightened of the plaintiff. I fear for my life. They know my car. They know my rego. I'm frightened they may come around and find me and Peter,' words to that effect.""

Clearly, the questions asked by counsel pick up the answer recorded by the Senior Constable at line 13 on p 220. The hyperbole, for such I believe it to be, was introduced by the Senior Constable himself. However, the hyperbole must be tempered by the words ""words to that effect"". The hyperbole may be merely a reflection of the witness becoming exasperated by being cross-examined so closely and for so long. 

Evidence later available to SC Barnier

69Merely to deal with other evidence that was available to Detective Senior Constable Barnier on his decision to persist with arresting the plaintiff and to the charges to be laid against the plaintiff, I have brief recourse to other witness statements.

70Desmond Watson knew the plaintiff. In par 7 of his statement he said this:

""Melissa has gone over to the fighting males on the ground and she has begun to kick the first male, who was the smaller Caucasian fellow [Travers]. Melissa has kicked the first male to the head at least three times whilst he was on the ground, the other second male lying on top of him. The first male could not defend himself against these kicks as the second male was lying on top of him. The first male was laying on his back and the second male was laying on him face to face. Whilst Melissa was kicking the first male to the head, she was holding a half full schooner glass with beer in it. Melissa was yelling stuff I cannot remember. I went over to pull Melissa Tilse away and I took the glass off her.""

There is direct evidence which, if accepted by a tribunal of fact, would entitle that tribunal of fact to find the plaintiff guilty of affray. The identification is clear and the criminal act is clear from that statement.

71A statement was obtained from Mr Bradley Fisher by Senior Constable Philip Benfield on 27 April. In par 7 of that statement he said:

""I saw Melissa Tilse or similar who I know from Coutts Tavern and I know of her as my parents are friends of her parents. Melissa was kicking Peter while he was on the ground. She used her mostly the right foot but she may have also used her left foot. She kicked him about 6 times to the back and side of Peter's stomach.""

In his evidence Senior Constable Barnier said that he had a brief conversation with Bradley Fisher on the evening of 26 April when he attended but could not give his statement because Senior Constable Benfield was busy taking a statement from Nadine Close and dealing with Peter Travers who had been arrested. In the brief conversation with Mr Fisher, the Senior Constable said that Bradley Fisher said words to the effect of, ""She's known around town at Coutts Crossing to cause dramas with people she doesn't like."" Again, that was not particularly relied upon by Senior Constable Barnier in making his decision to arrest. He based his decision on the statements that were then available to him, namely from Mr and Ms Watson and Ms Nadine Close and the Travers. He did not specifically refer to that brief conversation he had with Bradley Fisher on the 26th and Mr Fisher did not give a statement of evidence until the 27th.

72A statement was obtained from Mr Travis Woolmer. He does not identify the plaintiff but he did refer to this:

""A couple of sheilas came out [of the hotel], some of them looked Aboriginal, and they started kicking and punching Pete.""

73A statement was obtained from Mr Mitchell Morgan, whose evidence was similar to that of Travers Woolner. In his statement he refers to a number of females kicking Peter Travers a few times. 

74In par 221 of her statement Kayla Horne, who went to the hotel, I infer, with Peter Travers said this:

""I did see two females kicking into Peter when he was on the ground. Both females were Caucasian. The first female was aged between 20 and 25 years of age dressed like a man in that she had baggy trousers and a hoodie jumper and blonde hair. The other female was aged in her early 30s. She had black pants and a red and black top on. She had long brown hair. Both of these females did kick Peter at least six times each. These kicks connected around the ribs of Peter."" 

The plaintiff does not answer the description of the first Caucasian female identified by Ms Horne, but, from what I have seen in other evidence, her description of the second Caucasian female is consistent with the appearance of the plaintiff on the evening in question. Clearly, there was evidence available sufficient to ground a prosecution for the crime of affray. 
75There was, in addition, before Senior Constable Barnier, before he made his decision to arrest the plaintiff, evidence of fear given by Mr Peter Travers. According to Senior Constable Barnier, Travers said to him, ""I'm shit scared"" of both David Daley and the plaintiff. The Senior Constable went on to give evidence of his saying words to the following effect:

""I don't want to go to court if they're there. They'll see my face. They know our car. They live in the community. It's only a matter of time before they find out where we live. I have no doubt that they will come and find us and basically bash me."" 

The Senior Constable then went on to say that Travers also told him that his girlfriend Nadine Close also had fears. Those fears are independently given and have already been discussed.

76I have some difficulty accepting that Travers would have said the words, ""I'm shit scared"". That is not consistent with his behaviour on 25 April, nor is it consistent with the bravura contained in his Facebook postings on the morning of 26 April. The question is: Is there any basis for his holding such fears? There might be but I doubt that he would have said words to the effect of ""I'm shit scared"". That, again, appears to be some hyperbole intruding itself into the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier.

Summary of evidence available to SC Barnier

77I can now turn to consider the evidence that the Senior Constable had available to him in summary form at the time he decided to arrest the plaintiff on the evening of 26 April 2011. He had physically met her at 18 Lakkari Street on 26 April. She was intoxicated. She was foul mouthed and she was aggressive. That is consistent with how she behaved back in 2002. Of course, the plaintiff does not agree to the extent of her interaction with the police as deposed to by the Senior Constable and submissions have been made to me on behalf of the plaintiff that the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier could have been corroborated by the evidence of Detective King and the evidence of then Probationary Constable Andrew Jeffrey. However, equally, the evidence of the plaintiff, who has the onus of proof, could have been corroborated by Cindy Wilson, Amber Murphy, Tony Murphy, Natasha Wilson, Gary Brush and Samantha Polley, but it was not. On that issue I prefer the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier.

Plaintiff's criticisms of SC Barnier's evidence

78The evidence of the Senior Constable was criticised because in his statement, which is exhibit 16, there is a missing word. In par 5 of Senior Constable Barnier's statement of 13 June 2011, which is exhibit 16, the Senior Constable says this about what happened at 18 Lakkari Street:

""The accused Tilse has yelled, 'You're all fucked, we're gonna fucking sue, the ombudsman will have your fucking jobs.' Detective Senior Constable King had attempted to explain to the accused police powers of entry to search for an accused person where they believe on reasonable grounds an accused resides, however the accused Tilse has continued her verbal abuse.""

It should be noted that the Senior Constable did not use the words ""fucking pigs"" in that paragraph and that's why his evidence was criticised, because of his failure to record police being described as ""fucking pigs"". That, unfortunately, is a very common method of insulting members of the constabulary and in my view nothing turns on its being omitted. It is so often mentioned as to be hardly mentionable. In his evidence, when it was pointed out to him that the expression ""fucking pigs"" is a very offensive term, Senior Constable Barnier said, perhaps laconically, ""We hear it a bit."" It was then suggested to the Senior Constable that there was an attempt by the plaintiff, on his version of events, to intimidate him and perhaps, if what he was saying were correct, he ought to have charged the plaintiff with intimidation. However, he went on to tell me this at the foot of p 195:

""Q. But the law of intimidation doesn't - there's not one law for intimidation on the street and intimidation in someone's house, is it? If you're intimidating an officer, you're intimidating him, aren't you?

A. Sir, as I said before, we were in someone's house. She was intoxicated. People were drinking. You've got just to take it into context. We can't be upset by every time someone calls us names. That is our job. We wear the uniform, we've got to expect it, and Magistrates have said that to us.""

No doubt, the Senior Constable was referring to on-line decisions of the Local Court in which magistrates have dismissed charges brought of using offensive language when people have insulted members of the constabulary either in private or in public places. That answer reflects sound common sense and sound common policing.

79As I said, I prefer the version of events of Senior Constable Barnier to the evidence of the plaintiff as to what occurred at Lakkari Street. I therefore accept that the plaintiff, at the time she first met Senior Constable Barnier, was intoxicated, aggressive and abusive. There was evidence available to the Senior Constable that the plaintiff herself was capable of goading others to violence and herself inflicting violence by, for example, kicking a man on the ground and punching Nadine Close. There was also evidence available to the Senior Constable that the plaintiff and David Daley were a couple, were in essence man and wife, and that Mr Daley was a troublemaker and a direct statement by Mr Watson that in addition to Mr Daley being a troublemaker, the plaintiff herself was a troublemaker. Not only had David Daley caused him trouble before but so had she. They were troublemakers in the sense that they were argumentative and started fights. Mr Watson was concerned that they might return. Mrs Watson had told the Senior Constable that the plaintiff was a spiteful woman and held grudges and that she ""uses standover tactics"". She was concerned not only for her hotel but also for her family, which was one of the expressed concerns of Mr Brett Watson.

80Ms Nadine Close had also expressed a fear of Melissa Tilse, although I do not accept that it is probable that she said that she feared for her life but merely that she had fears. She had fears because, according to the evidence given by Senior Constable Barnier on p 139 of the transcript, she could find out where the witness lived and she could seek revenge if she ascertained that Nadine Close had made a statement.

81There is nothing to impeach the credit before me of either Mr Brett Watson or Ms Kim Watson or Nadine Close. There was nothing before Senior Constable Barnier that could be seen to impeach their credibility. He was entitled to accept the fears that they expressed to him. Those fears amount, in my view, to reasonable grounds to enable the Senior Constable to suspect that there might be harassment of or interference with some person or persons who might be called upon to give evidence in the proceedings against the plaintiff for affray.

82In my view, therefore, the defence has made out a case that the Senior Constable Barnier suspected on reasonable grounds that it was necessary to arrest the plaintiff in order to prevent harassment of or interference with persons who may be required to give evidence in respect of the charge of affray against the plaintiff. In making that finding I have used the word ""necessary"", as it is the word used in s 99(3). However, the plaintiff has advanced a number of arguments as to why it was not necessary and I will deal with those arguments and other evidentiary matters tomorrow.

FRIDAY 13 DECEMBER 2013

83Shortly before I adjourned yesterday afternoon I made a finding that there were reasonable grounds for Senior Constable Barnier to suspect that the plaintiff might, or have the potential, ability or propensity to interfere or intimidate potential witnesses in the charge of affray that the Senior Constable had determined to lay against the plaintiff. Implicit in that finding is an acceptance, to a large extent of the thrust of the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier.

84There has been an attack on his credit that has been partially successful. I shall in due course turn to that attack and point out what appeared to me to be a number of inconsistencies in his evidence. However, I formed a favourable impression of the Senior Constable and I accept that he did his best to tell me the truth as he perceived it, albeit at times he clearly was exasperated by the lengthy cross-examination to which he was subjected. However, there are some general matters which should be noted.

85In cross-examination, at p 209, the following evidence was given by the Senior Constable:

""Q. There is always a risk that a witness is going to be harassed or intimidated.

A. In my experience it usually happens after charges are laid.

Q. There is a risk though.

A. Before charges are laid?

Q. Before charges are laid there's a risk.

A. There is, but from experience the offenders usually lay low, trying to avoid us at all costs.

Q. And there is a risk after charges are laid, isn't there?

A. Certainly.

Q. There's always a risk.

A. More so.

Q. And it's a question of evaluation of the risk, isn't it?

A. Well, they've got a reason. They've got motivation to harass, intimidate and interfere with witnesses after a charge has been laid.""

That evidence was, in essence, dismissed by Mr Barham in his submissions as being of little or no weight, but to me it rings very much of common sense. It accords not only with the experience of Senior Constable Barnier, but also with the experience of the Courts. Why would anyone try to interfere with a potential witness if it was not known that any charge would be laid, as the Senior Constable said?
When it is not known if charges are to be laid the person potentially to be charged would, ""lay low"", or keep his or her head down, to seek to avoid drawing any attention to himself or to herself. Although there is no suggestion that the plaintiff herself interfered with or intimidated any witness prior to her arrest on 1 May 2011, the potential was much greater once she became aware that she was to be charged and prosecuted.

86The other general factor to bear in mind is that, as far as Senior Constable Barnier knew, the plaintiff and David Daley were living together as man and wife, that they were a de facto couple. Such was the information given to him by Mr and Ms Watson of the Coutts Crossing Tavern. The ancient common law principle that a man and his wife are one still persists in our community. It is a little over a hundred years since married women became entitled to hold property in their own right and to make contracts, and it is only in the same period of time that the law permitted one spouse to sue another. The law still recognises the principle. In the Evidence Act 1995, s 18 limits their compellability in criminal proceedings. In the current case the Senior Constable knew that the plaintiff came to the assistance of David Daley when he was involved in a fistfight with Peter Travers. It is common experience in our community for one spouse to protect another, and sometimes that protection can extend to taking unlawful measures. It is reasonable to infer that even if David Daley was a greater risk to witnesses than was the plaintiff, that the plaintiff could encourage David Daley to intimidate, harass or interfere with witnesses on her behalf.

87Mr Barham, for the plaintiff, sought in his submissions to distance David Daley from the plaintiff, or perhaps I should have said, to distance the plaintiff from David Daley, pointing out that his criminality was greater than that of the plaintiff, and her situation was different to that of David Daley. However, the distancing exercise undertaken by counsel might not be undertaken by persons such as Senior Constable Barnier when he believed that, in essence, the plaintiff and David Daley were man and wife.

88I turn now to consider the cross-examination of the Senior Constable. In his submissions, Mr Barham pointed out 23 separate areas which, he submitted, show that the evidence of the Senior Constable ought not be accepted. For example, the first one was that Probationary Constable George Chakty, is shown both on the Court Attendance Notice and the Fact Sheet which were ultimately prepared, as one of the arresting officers. The fact is that the only person who arrested the plaintiff was the Senior Constable. However, the fact that Chakty is recorded as an arresting officer is explained by the fact that certain forms have fields for recital of two members of the police force as arresting officers, and those fields had to be filled in. Chakty was in fact the Senior Constable's ""partner"" on both 25 and 26 April, and 1 May. It is merely the form filling procedure which caused Chakty's name to be included rather than any attempt by the Senior Constable to mislead anyone. There is no validity in the submission. 

89The Senior Constable was pressed, at the foot of p 182 and the top of p 183, about why he had not arrested Melissa Tilse at 1.20pm on 1 May, at the time he arrested David Daley. The Senior Constable gave evidence that he wanted to arrest both, but the reason that he didn't arrest the plaintiff was because of her children. This evidence was then given:

""Q. But, when you knocked on the door she answered the door. Why, at that point didn't you say, 'I'm placing you under arrest in relation to an affray on Anzac Day last year'?
A. I knew Dave Daley was in the house hiding.

Q. You had two officers there though, didn't you?
A. He was a bigger threat.

Q. But you could've arrested Ms Tilse if that really was your intention at the time, couldn't you?
A. We wanted Dave Daley. He was a dangerous man.

Q. There was nothing preventing you from arresting Melissa Tilse at that time, and coming back for Mr Daley, was there?
A. Well, if we did that Dave Daley could have escaped.

Q. He could have, but, you know--
A. It's just operational policing. You've got to get the main offender, the most dangerous offender, first.""

That to me is a valid reason for proceeding to arrest David Daley rather than Melissa Tilse combined with the fact that the Senior Constable was aware that the plaintiff had in her home at least two of her children which is another reason why he did not proceed to arrest her at that time. I do not believe that the Senior Constable's evidence can be criticised because he made a decision on the spot to proceed to arrest David Daley and to take him in the caged police truck to the Grafton Police Station, and desisted in arresting Melissa Tilse at that time.

90On p 187 the Senior Constable, in answer to a question concerning Ms Tilse, said that he feared that ""they"" were going to interfere with the witnesses, meaning both David Daley and the plaintiff, joining the two together as man and wife in the way that I have earlier referred to. I have also earlier referred to the Senior Constable being exasperated by the cross-examination.

91Between p 187, line 30, and p 188, line 40 is a piece of cross-examination that was completely unnecessary because the cross-examiner mistook what the plaintiff had said in-chief as recorded at the top of p 126 of the transcript. 

92At the top of p 189 the Senior Constable volunteered this about Peter Travers:

""I knew he went to hospital but didn't know the results at that stage. I didn't actually find that out until probably the 26th.""

With the utmost respect, the Senior Constable did not know that at all because it appears that Peter Travers never went to the hospital. At the foot of p 189, I pointed out to the Senior Constable that Nadine Close had told him when he interviewed her on the evening of the 26th that she had attempted to take Peter Travers to the hospital but he would not go to the hospital. I pointed out to the Senior Constable that there was nothing to suggest that Peter Travers ever went to the hospital and, for example, had stitches. In response to that the witness said, ""I could be wrong though."" Then Mr Barham, shortly afterwards, put this question:

""Q. And, ultimately, probably on the twenty sixth and not before you established that, in fact, Mr Travers probably hadn't ever gone to hospital?
A. Yeah, I can't say if he did or didn't.""

This clearly is a back-sliding by the Senior Constable from the first statement that he made at the top of p 189, about Travers having been to hospital. It would appear that the Senior Constable was prepared to say things off the top of his head without closely searching the material that would have been before him at the time, and therefore he had not adequately researched matters before giving evidence.

93At the foot of p 190 it was established that the seriousness of the ""glassing"" that the Senior Constable perceived on 25 April was substantially different on 26 April when Mr Travers went to the police station to be interviewed and was arrested and electronically interviewed by Senior Constable Barnier. Indeed, exhibit 19, police photographs, show four photographs of Peter Travers, taken, according to the captions, on 25 April, but they appear to have been taken at the police station; the dating of the photographs may be erroneous. The injuries shown on the photographs do not suggest any stitching or bandaging or the like. 

94The next area of cross-examination concerned the omission of the words, ""fucking pigs"", in the insults attributed to the plaintiff by the Senior Constable at 18 Lakkari Street, on the evening of 25 April, and that I dealt with yesterday. 

95On p 189 of the transcript, Mr Barham was cross-examining the Senior Constable about events at Lakkari Street, and the following evidence was given:

""Q. I suggest to you, sir, that you were not, in any way, of the belief at Lakkari Street that the plaintiff was going to assault you.
A. If she - if you took it in context of how aggressive she was, yelling, pointing her finger at us, giving the verbal abuse, as I stated, plus there was, like, another ten or so intoxicated persons on the back patio. We could have been in a very serious location.

Q. Yes, but I'm not talking about the other people, I'm talking about the plaintiff assaulting you.
A. In my view she's capable of anything.""

That view is clearly hyperbole. I mentioned yesterday that which was open to the Senior Constable to conclude was the nature of the plaintiff, but in no way could anyone form any reasonable view on what was known of the plaintiff that she was literally ""capable of anything"". 

96On p 200 the Senior Constable was cross-examined about the circumstances which took Peter Travers to the police station. Exhibit 4, the COPS entry, clearly records that at 6.46pm on 26 April 2011, the Senior Constable contacted Peter Travers and made an appointment, ""to attend Grafton Police Station re statement"", on that day. The Senior Constable agreed that that was what the document recorded, but then gave this evidence:

""Q. That's what you did, wasn't it? You said to him, 'Come down and make a statement.'""?

A. No.

Q. Why would you use the wording, ""a statement"" in the COPS event reference if you didn't, in fact, ask him to come down and make a statement?

A. He's a victim.

Q. Well, victims make statements don't they?

A. That's right.

Q. They give evidence statements don't they?

A. But, he's a suspect.

Q. You just said he's a victim.

A. Well, if you want to get technical, he's both.


Q. But what you did, you asked him to come down and make a statement, didn't you?

A. No, I told him, ""I need you to come to the station to speak to you.""

I accept that the COPS event entry is accurate, that the Senior Constable did ask Mr Travers to come down to the police station to make his statement, but when he arrived at the station the Senior Constable arrested him and interviewed him electronically. There is no doubt that after the electronically recorded interview the Senior Constable decided to release Mr Travers from custody unconditionally and told him that he would be issued with a, ""future Court Attendance Notice"", which in the Senior Constable's eyes was the equivalent of the old Summons, although the issue was not explored in evidence. It appears to me likely that the idea of issuing a ""future CAN"" was because he needed to have both Travers and Daley before the court at the same time and he would not know the return date of any Court Attendance Notice until such time as he could arrest at least Daley and obtain a return date for any CAN that was issued to Daley. The Senior Constable gave evidence that when he interviewed Peter Travers he thought he was ""really frightened and scared"", and that he was ""no risk to the hotel. He was no risk to Kim and Brett. He was petrified of the plaintiff and Peter Daley."" Again, the word ""petrified"" appears to me to be hyperbole.

97 At p 205, line 31, the Senior Constable is again asked whether he said to Peter Travers to come down to the station and make a statement, and again the Senior Constable said that is not what he told Travers, but I cannot accept that assertion, just as I could not accept the earlier assertion he made on the same topic. However, that again indicates a repetitive cross-examination.

98 It is common ground that the police resources at the Grafton Police Station were, to the say the least, ""stretched"", and to put it probably more accurately, there was a large understaffing of police in the period with which I am dealing, between Anzac Day and 1 May 2011. The Senior Constable was cross-examined to the effect that because he knew the police resources were limited, and because he knew that he himself would be busy in processing David Daley after his arrest, that he could have asked Melissa Tilse not to come down to the police station straightaway, that is, after 1.20pm on 1 May, but he could have asked her to come to the station two or three hours later. He said that there was, ""no way"", that he would do that and he asked rhetorically, ""Why would I do that?"" It was a fair question to ask and a question which the Senior Constable avoided. 

99 At the top of p 209 of the transcript Mr Barham commenced cross-examining the Senior Constable about the alleged perception that the plaintiff was a potential risk to witnesses. At line 3 Mr Barham introduced the words, ""terrible risk"", to which the witness gave a positive response on two occasions. Then Mr Barham asked this question:

""Q. A terrible risk?

A. Well, certainly a risk, yes.""

It was Mr Barham who used the terminology ""terrible risk"", and although the Senior Constable agreed with the question, when the questioning concentrated on the risk being terrible the Senior Constable merely referred to ""a risk"", which, of course, is to his credit.

100 Commencing at p 209 there commenced a fairly lengthy cross-examination about an alternative alleged by the plaintiff, that the Senior Constable could have obviated any potential risk not by arresting the plaintiff and arranging for bail conditions to be imposed, but by taking out an interim, or apprehended personal violence order. It was the Senior Constable's view that police did not seek personal violence orders, and that can be found at p 213, line 44, and also p 224, line 25. He was then asked in general terms why he did not believe an apprehended violence order of some type was appropriate, and gave this evidence:

""A. In my experience, if I did apply for an AVO, like an interim AVO, the on-call magistrate would have contacted me and he would have asked me some questions about it. He would most likely have said, 'Constable, where was the threat?' I would have to say, 'Your Honour, there was no verbal threat, but there is certainly a perceived threat of the victims.' He would most likely ask me another question and say, 'Constable, is this domestic related?' I would have to say, 'No, it is not, your Honour.' He would then most likely ask me a question, 'Where did this happen, constable?' I would have had to say, 'It happened in a public car park outside a hotel.' He would then have most likely asked me, 'Do the defendants know where the victims reside?', and at that stage I would have to say, 'I don't think they do'. So I guess it's three reasons why I did not apply for an AVO.""

Police commonly apply for apprehended domestic violence orders on an interim basis. The Senior Constable acknowledged that. However, it was not his experience that police applied for apprehended personal violence orders and he had never heard of that being done. Clearly, the Senior Constable, in his service, would have applied on a number of occasions, perhaps a large number of occasions, for ADVOs, and the evidence which I have just quoted is no doubt based on his experience in applying for ADVOs. However, again, what the Senior Constable said in the evidence I have just quoted appears to me to be sound, accurate, and truthful, and is a fair reflection in my view of his experience and would be the likely sort of exchange that would have occurred had the Senior Constable applied for an interim APVO.

101 The next criticism was based on the witness volunteering that Nadine Close had told him that she, ""feared for her life"", but again, I dealt with that yesterday, and again pointed out that it represents hyperbole by the Senior Constable.

102On p 226, when he was being cross-examined about the fears of Peter Travers, the Senior Constable described him as being, ""scared shitless"". Then Mr Barham asked him whether that was Peter Travers' fear of Melissa Tilse, and the Senior Constable said it was, both of Melissa Tilse, and of the other offender, David Daley. Again, I accept that Mr Travers expressed some fears, but again, the terminology, ""scared shitless"", in my view, represents hyperbole. However, it is also indicative of Mr Travers and the Senior Constable putting David Daley in same boat as Melissa Tilse, of regarding them as a couple, an issue I have already dealt with.

103At p 239, Mr Barham returned to the proposition that Melissa Tilse could have been arrested at the same time as Mr David Daley, and there was then some cross-examination directed to whether police usually put co-accused together in one caged truck to take them to the police station. The Senior Constable replied that the police did not usually like putting two co-accused persons in a caged truck together. It was then pointed out that the distance between the plaintiff's residence and the police station would have only taken five minutes, and Melissa Tilse and David Daley could have spent some considerable time together between the evening of Anzac Day 2011, and 1 May 2011, and therefore the likelihood of their colluding in a period of five minutes whilst in the back of a police caged truck was remote. However, that cross-examination ignores the fact that the other reason for not arresting Melissa Tilse at the time was because of the need for her to obtain a babysitter to look after her children. 

104Commencing at p 242, there commenced a lengthy section of cross-examination about whether the Senior Constable could have issued a field Court Attendance Notice to the plaintiff at the police station for this offence. It appears that the police divide court attendance notices into four types: a field CAN, a future CAN, which I have earlier described as the old Summons procedure, a bail CAN, that is, a court attendance notice that is given to a person who has been admitted to bail, and a non-bail CAN, a court attendance notice issued to a person who is refused bail and therefore remains in custody and must be taken before the court at the earliest available opportunity. This section of cross-examination was complicated by the fact that Mr Barham's questions were directed to physical possibilities, and the Senior Constable's answers were largely based on practical possibilities and established police procedures. For example, it was entirely physically possible for the Senior Constable to have issued a field CAN to the plaintiff at the police station. Indeed, exhibits 5 and 6, both relating to the arrest of the plaintiff on 8 June 2002, record that a field CAN was issued to the plaintiff at Grafton Police Station. However, the Senior Constable persisted in stating that it was not physically possible to issue a field CAN to the plaintiff at the police station. He said that he would be in dereliction of his duty if he did so.

105Any bail CAN or non-bail CAN has a return date before the Local Court and is given an H number, which essentially replaces the old plaint numbers that used to be fixed on summonses by the Registrar of the Local Court. The typewritten CAN, which includes a bail CAN, a non-bail CAN, and most likely also a future CAN, recite the name of the officer in charge, the name of the officer who created the court attendance notice, and the name of the person who, ""accepted"" the court attendance notice. In the current matter, the officer in charge, or prosecutor, was Senior Constable Barnier; he created the CAN and the CAN was accepted by Leading Senior Constable Philip Benfield. Any such CAN has to be accepted by a more senior officer, presumably by someone such as a sergeant or the officer in charge of the police station.

106The field in the CAN records only the name of one person as the apprehending officer, and on the court attendance notice for Melissa Tilse, the apprehending officer is given as Probationary Constable Chakty, who was not in fact the arresting officer. However, the custodial record does record two fields for the arresting officer as does the field arrest form. In those circumstances one can understand how Chakty's name found its way onto the CAN, and perhaps so that Senior Constable Barnier's name did not appear thrice on the CAN

107The Senior Constable made it clear that any of these typewritten court attendance notices, which is assigned an H number, must be accompanied by a fact sheet, and it is the fact sheet and the CAN which must be submitted to the accepting officer before he accepts the CAN as being valid. The Senior Constable admitted on p 254 that a CAN could be handed to somebody at the police station even if he or she had not been arrested, provided that it had been prepared. That concession was made. 

108On p 255 the Senior Constable was asked in what circumstances a field CAN was made. He said it was usually for traffic offences detected by Highway Patrol members. It might be used for ""minor street offences such as offensive conduct, offensive language, minor malicious damage"", and other ""things of a minor nature."" That, of course, raises this consideration and the Senior Constable's earlier reference to his being derelict in his duty. On 25 April 2011, shortly after he arrived at the Coutts Crossing Tavern, Senior Constable Barnier believed that a very serious offence had occurred and established a crime scene and called for a detective. Serious crimes are usually investigated by detectives, not by uniformed police. It is unusual for a uniformed officer to be in charge of an investigation of an affray, which is indictable, and carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. It would probably be one of the most serious charges that he or she might deal with. Any more serious charges would no doubt be dealt with by detectives. If Peter Travers had been more seriously injured it is likely that David Daley would have been charged not only with affray, but assault occasioning grievous bodily harm rather than with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. If the charge had been grievous bodily harm it appears to me, from my experience sitting in the criminal jurisdiction of this Court, that the officer in charge would almost invariably be a detective. In other words, for persons such as Senior Constable Barnier, dealing with the offence of affray might be one of the most serious offences for which he was an officer in charge. One can understand his, therefore, dealing with a matter other than in the way in which minor charges are dealt with, that is, by a field CAN. I believe that that was the reason that the Senior Constable said that he would be derelict in his duty if he dealt with the charge of affray offered against the plaintiff by way of a field court attendance notice.

109In his evidence-in-chief at p 163, the Senior Constable had commenced to outline the ""charging process"", and that evidence concerning the charging process is found between p 163, line 40, and 168, line 25. On p 165 the Senior Constable indicated that to generate a CAN and a fact sheet and to deal with the computer processes involved would take an hour or an hour and a half. However, in cross-examination the witness found it difficult to differentiate between the time taken to prepare, firstly, the fact sheet, and then the CAN. On p 266, in cross-examination, the witness indicated that once the fact sheet had been completed, finding the correct offence and preparing the CAN, including the court date, would take about 20 minutes. However, factually, I know that the Senior Constable completed interviewing the plaintiff at 4.44pm on 1 May, and the CAN was created at 4.50pm, six minutes later. Again, 20 minutes appears to me to be hyperbole. Similar hyperbole attaches to the estimate of one hour and 30 minutes required to generate both the fact sheet and the CAN.

110It is now clear, after again interminable cross-examination, largely by me, I have to admit, that Senior Constable Barnier commenced the fact sheet for the plaintiff at 1.41pm on 1 May 2011, shortly after the plaintiff was arrested. Which part was made before she was interviewed cannot be ascertained with any exactitude, but clearly, part of it was made after the interview had concluded. At p 283, the foot thereof, the Senior Constable admitted that he spent approximately 20 minutes, or a half hour working on the fact sheet from 1.41pm onwards. It would appear that a large proportion of the fact sheet was made before the plaintiff was interviewed. There is force in the submission put to me by Mr Barham that the creation of the fact sheet could largely have been a copying and pasting exercise because the Senior Constable had, at seven minutes past midnight, on 27 April 2011, commenced creating a fact sheet for Peter Travers. At 2.25am on the same day they commenced a fact sheet for David Daley, and the fact sheets themselves contain, sometimes verbatim, including typographical errors and the like, and punctuation mistakes, the same matter that is contained in the narrative in the COPS entry. It appears to me highly likely that the estimate of time of one hour to an hour and a half for the creation of both the fact sheet and the court attendance notice is excessive. Considering that the witness had spent between 20 and 30 minutes on the fact sheet prior to interviewing the plaintiff I would have thought that no more than half an hour would have been required after the interview to complete the fact sheet for the plaintiff. Again, hyperbole was used to estimate the time. 

111On p 286 of the transcript the witness agreed that he would speak to the person in charge of the police station, who is the officer authorised to grant bail, at the relevant time Leading Senior Constable Benfield, and tell him that if bail were to be granted he wanted strict conditions. The nature of the conditions could be discussed with Leading Senior Constable Benfield.

112On p 288 Mr Barham put to the Senior Constable that he never telephoned the plaintiff before 1 May and asked her to come down to the station. The answer given by the witness was: ""I didn't have those details."" That was untrue. He recorded the plaintiff's address and telephone numbers in his notebook on 25 April 2011. It was then put to the witness that he did have those details but he then promptly corrected himself. The prompt correction, of course, indicates that he may have given his first answer inadvertently, and in the circumstances it is hard to attribute any great significance to the first incorrect answer.

113Again on p 291, the witness was being cross-examined about bail conditions. He was certainly ""fencing with counsel"", when the Senior Constable tried to suggest that the conditions were a matter for the bail sergeant, but clearly putting to one side his earlier concession, that he could discuss bail conditions with the acting bail sergeant.

114The Senior Constable was then cross-examined about the proposition that he could have said to the plaintiff that if he charged her he would be seeking to impose bail conditions and obtained her consent to that, so that it was not necessary to arrest her. The answers given by the Senior Constable in that regard I find to be unsatisfactory. He said this, ""Well, then I'd be implying to her that she would get bail. So I could be lying."" Suggesting to the plaintiff that if he charged her he would be seeking certain bail conditions was something that was open to him. It does not imply that the bail sergeant would grant bail at all.

115Again, at the top of p 312, when I suggested to the witness that he had been told by Peter Travers and his girlfriend, Ms Nadine Close, that they were scared, the witness volunteered, ""They were terrified"", which again to me speaks of hyperbole.

116The Senior Constable was then cross-examined by Mr Barham about attending the plaintiff's house on the night of 25 April, and the witness accepted that he did not knock at the door, but he said that there are many things that need to be considered when police start knocking on people's doors late at night, especially if there are no lights on and there are believed to be children in the house. A knock by a uniformed officer on the door in the middle of the night can often engender fear because a police officer is very often a harbinger of bad news such as a tragic death at a road accident or other crime scene. There is no credit issue involved in that.

117On 1 May 2011, Senior Constable Barnier had, prior to going to Melissa Tilse's residence, phoned Kim Watson at 11.55am and obtained from her the location of the residence of the plaintiff's parents in Coutts Crossing. In cross-examination, at p 313, this evidence was given:

""Q. You were asked by Mr Spartalis, 'Why did you call the Watsons?' and you answered, 'I had trouble locating the plaintiff and Dave Daley at that stage, and was after any new information where they might be'.

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. That wasn't a truthful answer was it?

A. It was dead true.""

I can accept that it was ""dead true"" of Mr David Daley, but not that it was ""dead true"" about Melissa Tilse. He had Melissa Tilse's home address and telephone numbers and he had made no attempt to call at her residence during the day or at night when someone was at home burning a light and he had made no attempt to call her. The Senior Constable may have believed that David Daley might have been hiding at his ""partner's"" parents' address and hence the need to obtain those details, but as far as Melissa Tilse was concerned it was an unnecessary inquiry. Again, the witness was then pressed about whether the plaintiff, as distinct from David Daley, was seeking to avoid the police, which was certainly true of David Daley, but there is no suggestion and no evidence that Melissa Tilse was seeking to hide from the police. This is a valid criticism on this occasion of the Senior Constable's treating David Daley and Melissa Tilse with the same brush.

118At p 319, the Senior Constable was cross-examined about the time of the creation of the CAN. He volunteered this, ""I would have just created an H number, your Honour, because they can't fingerprint defendants without an H number. So that's a way of speeding the process up."" We do know, of course, that the CAN was generated at 4.50pm. If he merely generated the H number at that time, it was to speed up the process of fingerprinting. However, fingerprinting did not occur until after Leading Senior Constable Benfield came on duty at 6pm, and it is likely, in my view, to have been closer to 7 than to 6 by the time of the photographing and fingerprinting of the plaintiff. There is some tension, to say the least, in the evidence which I have just recited. If it was to speed up the process then why did nothing happen between 4.50pm and perhaps two hours later?

119The witness was then again pressed about his view that the plaintiff could be suspected as a person who might interfere with, or intimidate witnesses. At p 320 of the transcript, at line 41, the witness volunteered, ""They're dangerous people"", clearly putting the plaintiff and David Daley in the same boat. However, the witness was making a value judgement, which on the information which he had collected by the end of the evening of 26 April 2011 he was, in my view, entitled to make. Likewise, on the following page he referred to the plaintiff and Mr Daley as, ""both very violent people"", and what had been described to the Senior Constable by others, and what he himself observed at 18 Lakkari Street on 25 April, could clearly lead him to such a view as at the evening of 26 April 2011.

120I need not say anything further about the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier other than to record those criticisms which were the subject of various submissions by the plaintiff's counsel. However, leaving aside the question of hyperbole and the question of being exasperated by the cross-examination process, I still accept that Senior Constable Barnier has done his best to tell me the truth, albeit that he did that somewhat defensively. Indeed, I formed the distinct view that the Senior Constable thought that he was the accused in some criminal proceedings which, no doubt, engendered his defensive pose.

121Another thing which must be taken into account when one reflects on the state of mind of the Senior Constable as it was exposed at the hearing before me, are things that were said by the plaintiff when she was interviewed by police. For example, commencing at question 161, the following occurs in the electronically recorded interview:

""Q 161. ...Obviously, we've got quite a number of statements from witnesses of the incident. We've got a statement from one fellow saying that he, he's seen you kicking Peter while on the ground.

A. I think I did kick him once actually ... in the back.

Q 163. Any reason for that?

A. Well, I was quite pissed off that he just destroyed my birthday drinks. Was me 30th birthday. You only turn 30 once and we've got to put up with a little dickhead like that, that can't handle his alcohol.

Q 164. Okay. So, kicked him once in the back?

A. Yes.

Q 165. Because you were upset about, upset because he's upset?

A. No. Just, I was pissed off with the whole thing. It could've all been avoided and it was just, yeah, really pissed off that it wasn't avoided, and that he wasn't just asked to leave after he'd been cut off drinks.""

Later, this question and answer are recorded:

""Q 187. I'll carry on. We've got another statement from another witness that says, 'saw a woman kicking a fellow whilst on the ground'. Another statement naming yourself, 'kicking the fellow on the ground to the head'. Did you kick him to the head?

A. No, I kicked him once in the back when he was sitting upright. He was sitting on the road. I went to walk over to see where Dave was. I saw him sitting there. I kicked him. I said, 'You little cunt. You started all this shit', and then I walked past.""

122Later in the same interview the plaintiff tried to sheet home responsibility for the brawl at the tavern to the publican, Mr Brett Watson. She was asked at Q206 whether she was acting out of spite. She said that she was, that she was ""pissed off"", and continued at answer to Q208:

""Being sick to death of this crap going on every bloody time we go to that stupid poxy pub, because the publicans don't know how to keep control of their drunken patrons.""

At Q211 the plaintiff said, ""I should have known that Brett [Watson] loves to fill up his patrons until they're legless."" In other words, the behaviour of the plaintiff, which she admitted to in the electronically recorded interview, must have played some role in the attitude which Senior Constable Barnier presented to the Court when giving his evidence.

LEPRA s99(3)

123I now must turn to the provisions of s 99 of LEPRA. The relevant part of subs (3) is this:

""A police officer must not arrest a person for the purpose of taking proceedings for an offence against the person unless the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to arrest the person to achieve one or more of the following purposes:
........................................................................
(d) to prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence.""

The first thing to note is the use of the word ""necessary"". A submission has been put to me as to how it ought to be construed. Necessary is one of those words which in our language is an absolute: something is necessary or it is not; something is fundamental or it is not; something is basic or it is not; something is essential or it is not; something is unique or it is not...However the words, ""reasonably necessary"", are sometimes used in statutes, and it is clear that when the adjective is modified by the adverb, ""reasonably"", that the adverb modifies the absoluteness, or strictness of the necessity.

124Mr Spartalis referred me to a dictum of the Supreme Court of the United States in McCulloch v Maryland (1819) 7 US 159 at 203, which was referred to in [101] of the judgment of Gummow and Crennan JJ, in Thomas v Mowbray (2007) 233 CLR 308; [2007] HCA 33. There is no express power in the US Constitution granting to Congress any banking power. However the Bank of the United States was established to enable Administration to conduct its fiscal operations. US Constitution, s 8 clause 18 is in these terms:

""To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.""

The US Supreme Court relied on this provision in upholding the US legislation establishing the National Bank. The dictum relied on by Mr Spartalis was that used to interpret the word ""necessary"" in the clause I have just quoted. In McCulloch v Maryland Marshall CJ discussed the nature of a constitutional document: a broad outline of powers, intended to enure for generations; specifications and means are not inserted. His Honour concluded:

""Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution, are constitutional."" (at 421).

The Chief Justice's reasoning can be found in The Federalist No. 44 (Maddison)(1788). Unsurprisingly, the same principles are used by the High Court in interpreting the Australian Constitution: Lane's Commentary on the Australian Constitution (1986) L.B.C. p258. It is also unsurprising that the word ""necessary"" used in a constitutional document would be interpreted expansively. LEPRA however is not a constitutional document.

125 The High Court in Thomas v Mowbray was construing provisions of the Criminal Code of the Commonwealth, in particular s 104.4, which uses the words, ""reasonably necessary"". The provision of the Criminal Code being interpreted was what can be shortly referred to as anti-terrorism legislation. It appears to me to be completely inappropriate to look at a decision regarding the words, ""reasonably necessary"", when construing what the word ""necessary"" means in s 99(3) of LEPRA.

126Of greater significance however is the decision of O'Keefe J in Elcham v Commissioner of Police [2001] NSWSC 614. His Honour was there called upon to interpret a provision of the Liquor Act 1982, which used the word ""necessary"". Commencing at [47], and ending at [60], his Honour cited a large number of authorities about the meaning of the word ""necessary"", and the circumstances in which in statutory interpretation it has been construed as being, ""reasonably necessary"".

After reviewing a number of authorities, his Honour said, commencing at [57]:

""57. The trend of the decided cases is thus to the contrary of the strict approach to the meaning of ""necessary"", advocated on behalf of the plaintiffs.

58. However, in determining the appropriate meaning of the word ""necessary"" in a given case, it is essential to look at the context in which it is used, the purpose of the legislation, and its effects.

59. In the present case it is true to say that an order made under s 104A is likely to have detrimental economic and business effects. But these may be no more adverse than the denial of a significant tax deduction. In addition, it does not involve any direct criminal sanctions. The purpose of an order under s 104A is the protection of the public interest as defined in s 104A(3). By allowing the application and order to be made ex parte, albeit for a quite limited period, the section, in my judgement stresses the predominance of the protection of the public interest over the private detriment which may flow from the making of an order. Protection of the rights of the citizen is effected by the interposition of the authorised justice between the police and citizen, and the recognition by the authorised justice of the duty which is imposed on such justice in applying the section.

60. For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the word ""necessary"", as used in section s 104A(2)(b) of the Act, is not to be understood in the sense of essential or absolutely necessary.""

127Mr Spartalis submitted that, based on what fell from O'Keefe J, the word ""necessary"" in s 99 (3) should be construed as being reasonably necessary. I am unable to accede to that submission. The first point to note is that if it had been Parliament's intention that it be only reasonably necessary to arrest a person to achieve one or more of the six purposes listed in the paragraphs of subs (3), Parliament could have said so. It did not. To use a favourite adage of the late R P Meagher JA: the Act means what it says; moreover, it does not mean what it does not say.

128The next point to note is this, s 99 grants a power of police officers to arrest without warrant. It gives a power to police officers to take away the liberty of the subject. The common law has for century after century closely guarded the liberty of the subject, the personal integrity of every subject, and protected, some say with too much sanctity, the subjects' rights of property, both real and personal. In granting a police officer a right to arrest without warrant, one can understand Parliament limiting the power, and s 99(3) clearly limits the circumstances in which a police officer can use the statutory power granted to him earlier in the section, to arrest without warrant. Accordingly, I believe that I should construe the word ""necessary"" in its original, or primary meaning, that is, it must be necessary to do so, not that it is reasonably necessary to do so.

129The question that then arises is was it necessary for Senior Constable Barnier to arrest the plaintiff in order to have bail conditions imposed that would prohibit her from harassing or interfering with potential witnesses against her. The submission of the plaintiff in this regard is twofold. There were other means of imposing such conditions. The first is that the Senior Constable could have applied for a provisional apprehended personal violence order. Section 10 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 provides the objects of the Act in relation to personal violence. The provisions of the section are these:

""(1) The object of this Act in relation to personal violence is to ensure the safety and protection of all persons who experience personal violence outside a domestic relationship.

(2) This Act aims to achieve that object by:

(a) empowering courts to make apprehended personal violence orders in appropriate circumstances to prevent people from violence, intimidation (including harassment) and stalking, and

(b) ensuring that access to courts is as safe, speedy, inexpensive and simple as is consistent with justice, and

(c) ensuring that other avenues of dispute resolution are encouraged where appropriate.""

The first thing to note is that a potential witness who might be harassed or intimidated is not a person ""who experiences personal violence outside a domestic relationship"", that person only has the potential to be subjected to ""personal violence.""

130 Section 19(1) of the Act provides this:

""A court may, on application, make an apprehended personal violence order if it is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that a person has reasonable grounds to fear, and in fact fears:

(a) the commission by the other person of a personal violence offence against the person, or

(b) the engagement of the other person in conduct in which the other person:

(i) intimidates the person, or

(ii) stalks the person,

being conduct that, in the opinion of the court, is sufficient to warrant the making of the order.""

Before an APVO can be made, a person, that is, in the present context, a witness, must have ""reasonable grounds to fear"", and also in fact fears the commission of violence against him or her, or intimidation of that person, sufficient in the court's view to warrant the making of such an order. To obtain an order appears to me to be a more onerous exercise than imposing bail conditions. The granting of bail is discretionary. The person seeking a bail condition does not have to prove anything on either the civil or criminal standard of proof.

131 Section 25 of the Act permits a police officer to apply by telephone, facsimile or other communication device to an authorised officer for an interim APVO. Such an interim APVO is known as a provisional order. A provisional order can be made either at the request of the person seeking protection, in this case a relevant witness, or on a police officer's initiative, and may be transmitted to the authorised officer, generally a magistrate, by someone on behalf of the applicant if it is not practical for the application to be made by the person seeking the order directly. Generally, there is a magistrate available in the State at any one time to whom police can make applications for an apprehended domestic violence order, and presumably, also for an apprehended personal violence order on an interim basis.

132Section 26 governs the circumstances in which an application for a provisional order is made. Section 26 is in these terms:

""(1) An application can be made by telephone, facsimile or other communication device if:

(a) an incident occurs involving the person against whom the provisional order is sought and the person who would be protected by the provisional order, and

(b) a police officer has good reason to believe a provisional order needs to be made immediately to ensure the safety and protection of the person who would be protected by the provisional order, or to prevent substantial damage to any property of that person.

(2) An application may be made at any time and whether or not the court is sitting.""

One will note from s 26 (1) (a) that there must be some ""incident"" involving the person against whom the provisional order is sought, and the person in need of protection. I can hardly construe that requirement as encompassing a person making a statement to police about what that person heard or saw, a person, for example, such as Kim Watson, who was not involved in any way in the brawl, but merely saw it occurring. There was no incident involving Kim Watson and Melissa Tilse. Indeed, there was no incident in which Brett Watson came into direct contact with Melissa Tilse, although both were involved in the affray. The plaintiff was a protagonist, but Mr Watson merely sought to intervene to break up the affray. In the current matter there was an incident occurring between Nadine Close and the plaintiff. According to the plaintiff, Nadine Close scratched her and in self-defence she threw a punch at Nadine Close. That is looking at the matter through the eyes of the plaintiff rather than Nadine Close. However, there was a number of other witnesses as well who were not involved in the brawl, were not involved in the affray, and who made statements to the police, albeit that the defence does not raise those persons as persons who justify the necessity of the arrest. However, as a general proposition it appears to me that s 26 (1) (a) requires some incident involving the person charged and the potential witness, that is, more than just one person seeing what the other person was doing. In my view, in those circumstances, the seeking of a provisional order, that is, an interim APVO, is not in general the equivalent of seeking a bail condition preventing a person charged with an offence from harassing or intimidating witnesses.

133The written submissions on behalf of the defendant, which have been marked MFI 9, will be left with the papers lest the matter go further. They contain, commencing on p 16, the defendant's submissions concerning an allegation that Senior Constable Barnier should have made an application under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. The defendant submits that s 27 should also be considered when considering s 26. The submission at [43] is this:

""A police officer with standing under Part 7 must apply for a provisional order if the elements in s 27(1) exist, namely that:

(a) a police officer investigating the incident (being the same incident that is the subject of s 26(1)(a));

(b) suspects or believes an offence against s 13:

(i) has recently been,

(ii) is being committed,

(iii) is imminent, or

(iv) is likely to be committed,

against the person to be protected by the order; and

(c) the police officer has good reason to believe an order needs to be made immediately:

(i) to ensure the safety and protection of the person, or

(ii) to prevent substantial damage to the property of that person.

Again there is the requirement for an incident, and furthermore, there is a requirement that an offence under s 13, that is, stalking or intimidating another person with the intention of causing the other person to fear physical or mental harm has occurred, is occurring, or is likely to occur, which is a much stricter requirement than ""a suspicion on reasonable grounds"". These requirements are all much more onerous than the imposition of a bail condition, and in my view would cause, if the submission be correct, much more police work and much more work for the courts.

134I am unable to accede to the submission put to me by the plaintiff that as an alternative to granting bail, Senior Constable Barnier ought to have applied for an interim APVO. I do not believe I need to say anything further concerning that. 

135The next issue raised by the plaintiff is that it was not necessary to arrest the plaintiff because she had gone voluntarily to the police station: she was prepared to make a statement. She could have been given a Court Attendance Notice at the police station, and could have been granted bail without having been arrested. That requires an examination of the provision in the Act, and perhaps an examination of that Act, which is completely outside the familiarity of the members of the New South Wales constabulary. I shall deal with that after lunch.

LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT

136Before turning to the Bail Act, I should make a few more points about the submissions concerning the alternative suggested by the plaintiff that Senior Constable Barnier could have applied for an interim APVO. The Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, ""LEPRA"", received the Royal Assent on 29 November 2002 and commenced on 1 December 2005. The Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 received the Royal Assent on 7 December 2007 and commenced on 10 March 2008. When Parliament enacted the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, it could have amended LEPRA if it thought that the personal violence order provisions of the later Act were sufficient to replace the requirements of s 99(3)(d) by repealing that provision. However, it did not. Parliament itself could have indicated by some other provision that indicated to those exercising powers of arrest without warrant that they were to make an application under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 rather than arresting and seeking the imposition of a bail condition that a person not intimidate or harass witnesses. However, it did not. 

137The other matter which must be borne in mind is the consequence of the making of an APVO and the imposition of the relevant bail condition. If a person is bound by a conditional bail undertaking that he or she not associate with any specified person such as a witness and a police officer believes on reasonable ground that the person bound by the conditional bail undertaking has failed to comply with it or is about to fail to comply with it, the officer may arrest that person without warrant and take him or her as soon as practicable before a court. The policeman need only believe on reasonable grounds. If, however, an APVO is in place, breach of an APVO is a crime itself and, it would appear to me, as argued by the defendant, that a policeman to do anything if he thought that an APVO was going to be breached, would need to have sufficient evidence to be able to prove at least an attempt to breach the APVO. In my view, the seeking an APVO is not a valid or reasonable alternative to imposing a bail condition that a person not harass or interfere with any person that may be a witness. 

Can bail be granted without the need to arrest?

138I turn now then to the provisions of the Bail Act 1978. Section 4 (2) provides what might be thought to be the definition of, ""an accused person"", or, ""a person accused of an offence"", in the Act. However, s 4(2) is not exclusive. It merely includes a reference to persons in a number of categories. The first category is a person charged with an offence. The next person is a person convicted of an offence and the third is of a person found guilty of an offence. It also contains par (b) to par (f) which are not presently relevant. 

Section 7(1) commences, thus: 

""When:

(a) bail is granted to an accused person in respect of an offence,

(b) the person enters into the bail undertaking, and

(c) if a bail condition or bail conditions are imposed, it or they are entered into,

the person is, subject to this Act, entitled to be released (if in custody) and to remain at liberty in respect of the offence, until the person is required to appear before a court in accordance with the person's undertaking.""

The bracketed matter, ""(if in custody)"", clearly implies that a person is entitled to be released on bail even if not in custody. It follows that a person who appears before a court or an authorised officer but is not in custody can leave the presence of that court or that authorised officer with bail granted to him or her and is entitled to, ""to remain"", at liberty. The text of s 7(1) clearly envisages the granting of bail to a person who is not in custody or, to use other language, is not under arrest.

139Section 15 provides this:

""(1) An accused person may be granted or refused bail in accordance with this Act, notwithstanding that the person is not in custody.

(2) Nothing in this Act requires the grant of bail to an accused person who is not in custody.""

Again, the provisions of s 15 clearly point to the ability of a person who is not in custody to be granted bail.

140 Part 3 of the Bail Act is headed, ""Police Bail"". It contains ss 17 to 21. The ability of police to grant bail is a relatively new invention. The second volume of Sir William Holdsworth's, ""A History of English Law"", discusses, ""Anglo-Saxon antiquities"". Commencing at p 83, the learned author said this:

""Procedure dominates early law, so that it is not surprising to find that the earliest transactions of a contractual nature are connected with the law of procedure. One party to a legal proceedings promises the other that he will appear in court, that he will prepare his proof, or that he will satisfy judgment; and he provides sureties to guarantee the fulfilment of these promises. Not far removed from this, is the agreement made between two opposing families as to the payment of the wergild, when a member of one family has been murdered by a member of the other - an agreement the making of which was, as we have seen, at first entirely optional to the relations of the murdered man. If they agreed to accept compensation the representatives of the murderer promised the family of the murdered person that they would pay the wergild, and the family promised that the murderer might come and enter into the formal contract to pay the wergild. The parties then met; and the murderer made his promises, giving something as security (wed), and naming his sureties (borh). The peace was then restored by the mutual promises of the parties. In the law of procedure wed and borh long continued to be used as securities for the production of a defendant before a court of law; and in the following period, they became part of the common form of those writs to the sheriff in which he was directed 'ponere' a defendant 'per vadium et salvos pledgios'. But it would be a mistake to regard this furnishing of wed and borh as mere forms, and the arrangements which they sanctioned as merely formal contracts. The wed may have become at a very early date an article of trifling value, and its production therefore a mere form. But the furnishing of the sureties was no mere form; it was a substantial sanction. These sureties were bound primarily to the creditor; and it was to the sureties that he looked for the carrying out of the undertaking.""

The learned author then turned to certain provisions of foreign law and continued thus at the top of p 84: 

""Probably these sureties were regarded somewhat in the light of hostages; and English law still retains a trace of this primitive conception in the fact that the bail of our modern criminal law are bound 'body for body'. As Holmes says, modern books still find it necessary to explain that this undertaking does not now render them liable to the punishment of the principal offender, if the accused is not produced.""

141One can continue to read the history of bail in the fourth volume of Sir William Holdsworth's History. Commencing at p 525, the learned author says this:

""It may be that in early days those who offered themselves as security for the appearance of an accused person were literally bound body for body. But in the thirteenth century these sureties were only liable to amercement [fine] if they allowed their prisoner to escape. Later it became usual, either to make the surety promise by recognisance to pay a sum certain in the event of the non-production of the prisoner; or, combining the older idea of the nature of the surety's obligation with the newer means taken to enforce it, both to make him promise by recognisance to pay a sum certain in the event of his non-production, and to commit the accused to the surety's custody. If the accused was thus committed to the custody of the surety he was strictly and technically his bail; if the surety merely gave security for his appearance he was said to give mainprize and to be a mainpernor.

From an early period the sheriff had a large discretion as to the taking or refusing to take bail or mainprize. In the twelfth century it would seem that the only cases in which he could not take bail or mainprize were cases in which an accusation of homicide had been made. The writ by which the sheriff could be compelled to release the prisoner on bail or mainprize was the writ de homine replegiando; and, when that writ attained its final form, the list of cases in which bail must be refused had grown by the addition of offences against the forest law, an arrest by special command of the king."" 

142The learned author then goes on to discuss various enactments of the Middle Ages and the Tudor Age as to which offences would attract bail. The author points out at p 527 that by 1444 the power to grant bail was passing from the sheriff to the justices of the peace. The power was granted to the justices of the peace in general terms by a statute of King Richard III. The author then continues thus:

""With the accession of the Tudors a stricter control over the manner in which the power was used began to be exercised. A statute of 1487 recited that persons not bailable were often bailed, whereby many murderers and felons had escaped; and enacted that the power to bail should be exercised by no less than two justices, one of whom was to be of the quorum, and that the prisoners whom they bailed should be certified at the next general sessions of the peace or sessions of gaol delivery. It would appear that this statute had not worked altogether satisfactorily. It was stated in 1554 that one justice, in the name of himself and another who knew nothing of the case, had sometimes by 'sinister labour and meanes' set at large notable offenders. Justices were therefore prohibited from bailing any persons not bailable by the statute of 1275. Prisoners must be bailed in open sessions, and at least two justices, one being of the quorum, must be present at the time of the bailment. A certificate must be made to the next sessions of gaol delivery and the justices of gaol delivery were given power to fine justices for breach of the provisions of the Act. Later statutes were passed to ensure that bailors should be substantial persons, and to make special provision for bail in the case of particular offences; but the statute of 1275 as to offences bailable, and the statue of 1554 as to the procedure by which bail could be obtained, remained the basis of the law on this subject till 1826.""

143Accordingly, at the time of the foundation of New South Wales, power to grant bail resided in the justices of the peace. The first time that I am aware that power to grant bail was given to the police was by s 153 of the Justices Act 1902 inserted by Act No. 32 of 1918. Subsection (1) of that provision was this:

""Any member of the police force who is of or above the rank of sergeant or is for the time being in charge of a police station, and any gaoler shall have the same power of discharging any person who is in custody on the person's entering into a recognisance, with or without sureties, for a reasonable amount to appear before a Justice or a Court at any time and place named in the recognisance, or to comply with any order, or to perform any act, or on the persons giving security by an acknowledgement pursuant to subsection (1) of section 84, as a Justice has under the provisions of this Act. When any such member of the police force or gaoler refuses to discharge any such person on recognisance or on giving a security by an acknowledgement as aforesaid, the person shall be brought before a Justice as soon as practicable and the Justice shall thereupon hear and determine the matter.""

Apparently that provision was still in force even though the Bail Act was enacted because it is still contained in the Justices Act as it was reprinted on 2 May 2000. It is clear that under that grant of power a person to be granted bail was a person, ""who is in custody"". Accordingly, it would appear to me that prior to the enactment of the Bail Act 1978, police could only grant bail to persons who were in custody.

144Section 17 of the Bail Act 1978 bears a heading ""Authority for police to grant bail"". It provides this: 

""(1) A police officer may grant bail in accordance with this Act to an accused person who is present at a police station if the officer is:

(a) of or above the rank of sergeant and present at the police station, or

(b) for the time being in charge of the police station.

(2) A police officer may not grant bail to a person accused of an offence if:

(a) a determination concerning bail has been made by a court under this Act, or

(b) the requirement for bail has been dispensed with under this Act,

in respect of the offence.

(3) A police officer may not grant bail to a person who has been arrested pursuant to a warrant to bring the person before a court for sentencing and any such person must be brought before a court as soon as reasonably practicable.

(4) Despite subsection (3), a police officer may grant bail to a person referred to in that subsection if the police officer is satisfied that exceptional circumstances justify the grant of bail and the police officer is otherwise entitled to grant bail under this Act.""

It is to be noted that subs (1), besides identifying those police who are able to grant bail, provides that the police so authorised may grant bail, ""to an accused person who is present at a police station"". That provision does not mirror the verbiage of s 153 of the Justices Act 2002 which refers to the granting of bail to, ""any person who is in custody"". 

145Section 18 of the Bail Act provides this: 

""(1) Where a person is charged by a police officer with an offence and the person is in custody, the proper officer shall, as soon as reasonably practicable:

(a) give the accused person such information in writing respecting the person's entitlement to or eligibility for bail as is prescribed by the regulations and sign an acknowledgment in the prescribed form that he or she has given the accused person the information, and

(b) if the proper officer is:

(i) authorised to grant bail - determine whether or not bail should be granted to the person or bring the person or cause the person to be brought before a court, or

(ii) not authorised to grant bail - bring the person before the court or an authorised officer.

(2) The authorised officer before whom a person is brought pursuant to subsection (1)(b)(ii) shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, determine whether or not bail should be granted to the person or bring the person or cause the person to be brought before a court.

(3) In this section:

(a) a reference to the proper officer is a reference to:

(i) subject to subparagraph (ii) - the police officer who laid the charge against the accused person, or

(ii) where it is not reasonably practicable for the police officer referred to in subparagraph (i) to perform the duties prescribed by subsection (1) - the police officer for the time being in charge of the police station at which the accused person is in custody or, if the person is not in custody at a police station, a police officer who has custody of the person, and

(b) a reference to bringing a person before a court is a reference to bringing the person before a court for the purpose of having the court exercise its powers in relation to bail or for the purpose of the person being dealt with otherwise according to law.""

Clearly, s 18 is mandatory or compulsory where a person is charged by a police officer and is in custody. That person must be afforded information to exercise his or her rights to seek bail and be given an opportunity to seek bail from an authorised police officer that is one of or above the rank of sergeant or the officer for the time being in charge of the police station.

146In my view, there is force in the submission that there is a difference between ss 17 and 18. Section 17 grants, it is true, authority for police to grant bail but is facultative in the sense that it gives the authorised officers power to grant bail to an accused person who is present at a police station. Section 18 is not facultative but mandatory where there is a person at the police station in custody or otherwise in police custody. That person is to be given an opportunity to seek bail from the police.

147The following provisions in Pt 3 of the Bail Act do not assist me in the question of statutory interpretation. Section 35 of the Interpretation Act 1987 refers to headings, however, no submission was put to me as to the significance of the heading to s 17. Initially, I believed it to represented merely the granting of power to the police but, on reflection, it appears that it goes beyond that. 

148I earlier discussed this matter in Carey v State of New South Wales [2013] NSWDC 213 commencing at [40]. At [41], I pointed out that in the work of Howie and Johnson, Criminal Practice and Procedure New South Wales, provides no commentary on s 17 which I described as a, ""curious provision"". I appear to have accepted in that case that s 17 was purely facultative and that the substantive provision was s 18 and accordingly said, obiter, that the only power the police had to grant bail is if a person had been arrested. Under s 34 (2) of the Interpretation Act 1987, I am entitled to use certain extrinsic material. Under subs (2) (c), I am entitled to have regard to any relevant report of a committee of Parliament or of either House of Parliament before the provision was enacted or made. Exhibit 29 is a report of the Bail Review Committee ordered to be printed on 30 September 1976, a report to the Parliament of New South Wales. The report, I am told by a handwritten notation on it, was dated 30 September 1976 and was brought into existence for the purpose of reviewing bail procedures in this State which led to the enactment of the Bail Act 1978. 

149On p 32 of the report commences a section of the report relating to police bail. The first paragraph notes that the police power to release on bail is governed by s 153 of the Justices Act and exercised in accordance with instructions issued by the Commissioner of Police. On p 33, there is a heading, ""Alternatives to arrest and bail"". The following matter then appears:

""Police bail powers are used only where a defendant is arrested. If the summons procedure is used instead, the defendant is not taken into custody and the need for bail does not arise. 

Many people are now arrested, taken to a police station, charged and bailed when there was no need for arrest in the first place or when, after arrest, there was no need to formally charge and require bail. Many people arrested are well known to the police - or are readily identifiable - as likely to appear on a summons, or easy to locate if they do not. 

A summons procedure is certainly not appropriate in every case. For example, if a continuing breach of the peace is likely if the person is not arrested, or if he cannot readily provide information of his identity sufficient to satisfy police that he will appear, arrest is appropriate. 

But the Committee believes that many of the arrests now made are an abuse of power and unnecessary. Far greater emphasis should be placed on the use of alternatives to arrest which avoid the need to take the defendant into custody at all and reduce the amount of police time and resources involved in formally charging, bailing, holding, and transporting to court.""

150On p 34, another section of the report is headed, ""Citations in New South Wales"", and essentially advocates the adoption of a system in this State which was not enacted at the time of the Bail Act 1978 and which the Committee recommend which would have enabled police to issue the equivalent of a summons. This procedure has been much more recently adopted and is the CAN system. 

151 One can, therefore, glean from the provisions of the Bail Act itself, supported by that extrinsic aid to interpretation, an intention to entitle police with the requisite authority to grant bail to any person present at a police station and one can also glean from the Act that a person need not be in custody in order to be granted bail.

152 Counsel for each party have spent some considerable time in providing me with written submissions on the question of a proper interpretation of the Bail Act. The defendant's submissions on this aspect have been marked for identification 10 and will be left with the papers. The plaintiff's written submissions on the same topic are marked for identification 16 and will be left with the papers. I merely remark in passing that Mr Spartalis was able to find some commentary on s 15 of the Bail Act, being an observation by my late colleague, Mr Brian Donovan QC (as he then was) in his text, ""Law of Bail: Practice, Procedure and Principles"", published in Sydney in 1981 by Legal Books. My late colleague said that s 15:

""Apparently applies to an accused who, although not in custody, is liable to be taken into custody. The section may able to be used to deal with an accused in his absence in relation to bail.""

The first sentence of the comment which I have just made clearly indicates that the learned author believed that s 15 applied to an accused who, although not in custody, might be liable to be taken into custody and that would, of course, include a person at a police station who has been interviewed by police.

Was arrest of the plaintiff necessary?

153Accordingly, I have reached the view that it was open to Senior Constable Barnier not to arrest the plaintiff at the time she came to the police station to be interviewed by him. He clearly intended to charge her. He had formed that intention on the evening of 26 April 2011. He could have told her that he intended to charge her with affray and he could have told her that he would recommend to the bail sergeant that she leave the police station if she signed a bail undertaking which contained the terms or similar terms to the terms ultimately imposed. However, he did not. I wholly suspect that he did not do so because he did not know that he could do so. 

154 When Senior Constable Barnier arrested the plaintiff, he arrested her for the only valid purpose that an arrest can be effected: in order to commence proceedings against her for the crime for which he arrested her. In other words, the mere fact of arrest and stating that he arrested her for affray, ought to have told the plaintiff that she was going to be charged with affray. Whether or not that occurred to her at the time she was arrested would depend on the state of her legal knowledge, which I infer was not great.

It is clear that the plaintiff was prepared to provide a statement. If she had, when she presented herself to the police station, been afforded an opportunity to give her statement, it would have taken, one would think, the same amount of time that it actually took, 54 minutes. That means from the time she arrived at the police station, 1.35pm, she would have been finished at the police station by about 2.30. However, to proceed with the charging process, more time would have been required both to generate the facts sheet and the court attendance notice and undertaking the necessary forensic procedures of fingerprinting and photographing if such are applicable to someone who has not been arrested. 

155The complication, of course, was that David Daley was in custody. He needed to be interviewed. As he was the principal antagonist in the brawl at the Coutts Crossing Tavern, one would think his Court Attendance Notice would need to be generated, his date of appearance known and, therefore, the date to be placed on the Court Attendance Notice for the plaintiff and presumably on the future Court Attendance Notice to be issued to Peter Travers. The interview with Daley took 26 minutes. One can say roughly half an hour. One can see, therefore, the interview with the plaintiff going from roughly 1.35 to about 2.30, then a half hour for the interview with Daley takes one to about 3 o'clock and then perhaps an hour for processing Daley, then another hour to process the plaintiff which takes one to approximately 5pm. The question then is would the plaintiff have waited around in the police station from 2.30 to 5 o'clock? If one believes what the plaintiff herself asked me to believe, that she would be only at the police station for, ""an hour or two"", which appears twice on p 11 of the transcript, then one would not expect her to have waited beyond, say, 3.30. That would have been only an half hour after Daley had been interviewed, accepting that Senior Constable Barnier could have started interviewing the plaintiff immediately at 1.35 and then followed on swiftly with the interview with David Daley going up till 3 o'clock when it is clear from his evidence that he needed to attend to at least one other matter, which was the transfer of a juvenile arrested early on that morning by Senior Constable Barnier for breach of bail. He was bail refused at the police station and needed to be transported to the local juvenile detention centre and that occupied the period from 2.50 to 3.40pm. That, of course, is the best part of another hour which would extend it to around 5.45pm. It is unlikely in my view that the plaintiff would have waited around for such a period of time. She is likely to have gone home to take back the care of her children and to await the call from her middle daughter's friend's mother so that the plaintiff could pick her middle daughter up from her friend's place after the sleepover on the Saturday night preceding. 

156If that be the case, and the plaintiff had not been arrested, she was entitled to leave with or without the consent of Senior Constable Barnier. He would have been in the position of being able to issue her with a Court Attendance Notice in the mail, that is, the old summons procedure, or the future CAN. But he would not have been able to impose any bail conditions because the plaintiff would no longer have been at the police station. It is important to bear in mind the terms of s 17(1). The accused person to be granted bail must be, ""present at a police station"". Senior Constable Barnier could not have left the police station and gone to the plaintiff's home and served her with a Court Attendance Notice and bail conditions, let alone require her to sign her bail undertaking.

157I am acutely aware that the plaintiff's evidence is that she would have agreed to ""anything"", meaning bail conditions, in order to get out of the police station which is what she told Leading Senior Constable Benfield. The question is not whether she would have agreed to any particular conditions; the question is would she have waited around until the whole process could have been completed. That is the question. If one believes what she asked me to believe, then the inference I draw is that she would not have waited around. She would have gone home. If she had, that would not have allowed police to impose any bail conditions because she was no longer present at the police station. In referring to the time spent processing David Daley at the police station, I am, of course, giving consideration to the provisions of s 116 (2) (h) of LEPRA. I have accepted that Senior Constable Barnier had reasonable grounds to suspect that the plaintiff had the ability or propensity, that is, she could or might interfere with or harass witnesses. The question then becomes whether it was necessary for him to arrest her to achieve the purpose of preventing any such harassment or interference. 

158 The only practical way of seeking to prevent that harassment or interference was the imposition of bail conditions. Senior Constable Barnier himself could not grant bail. That could only be because he was not of the requisite rank. He had to leave that to the person in charge of the police station who was, after 6pm, Leading Senior Constable Philip Benfield. The time constraints indicate to me that the only practicable course was to arrest the plaintiff. She could have, if told that she was going to be definitely charged, refused an interview and left. She could have refused to wait around, kicking her heels until Senior Constable Barnier was ready to interview her. Even if Senior Constable Barnier interviewed her as soon as she arrived at the police station, she may have refused to wait after the interview was completed and certainly could well have refused to wait whilst he attended to the interview with Daley or transported the young offender to the juvenile detention centre. 

159It has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that if she indicated to Senior Constable Barnier that she was going to leave without his having served upon her a Court Attendance Notice and taken her before the officer in charge for the granting of bail, that he could then have arrested her because such arrest was in the circumstances necessary. However, it was always open to the plaintiff to leave without anyone's permission and to leave when Senior Constable Barnier would not have known that she was leaving, for example, when he was interviewing David Daley or when he was taking the young person to the juvenile justice centre, when she was physically out of the sight of Senior Constable Barnier. Furthermore, if she had not been arrested, one would think that she would have been required to wait in the foyer of the police station rather than in the charge room or even in an unlocked cell. One can easily glean from the evidence that I have heard and what I have seen that the plaintiff would, if she had felt that she had other things to do, hardly wait around to meet the convenience of the Grafton Police. 

160Accordingly, despite the ability of the police to impose bail conditions without an arrest being necessary, I am persuaded on the balance of probabilities that it was necessary for Senior Constable Barnier to arrest the plaintiff in order to prevent harassment of or interference with any person who might be required to give evidence in the proceedings for affray that the Senior Constable had determined to bring against the plaintiff. There was nothing in the knowledge of Senior Constable Barnier to suggest that the plaintiff might meekly wait around to be dealt with in due course by the police. He was entitled to take into account not merely the fact that she went voluntarily to the police station when he asked her to, as the plaintiff relies upon, but he is also entitled to take into account her behaviour towards him and other members of the police force on the evening on 25 April and to the fact that the plaintiff made a representation to Senior Constable Barnier at 1.20 on 1 May which was untrue, that David Daley was not in her house when he was. I am, therefore, persuaded on the balance of probabilities that the defendant has discharged the onus of justifying the necessity of the arrest of the plaintiff.

Period in custody was excessive

161 I have spent some nine hours thus far giving these reasons for judgment. Suffice it to say, that I also come to the view that the period that the plaintiff was held in custody was excessive. Section 115 of LEPRA provides that the investigation period is the period that begins when a person is arrested and ends at the time that is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances but does not exceed the maximum investigation period. The maximum investigation period is four hours. Section 116 makes provision for determining a reasonable time and s 117 provides for certain times to be disregarded in calculating the investigation period.

162The defendant submitted that the investigation period was in fact three hours and 13 minutes, deducting from the five hours and 43 minutes the four minutes in which the plaintiff was using the lavatory and two hours and 26 minutes commencing at 4.52 when the, ""charging process"" began. With the utmost respect to the defendant, that charging process is overly long and I have already spoken of that. Approaching the way I have approached this matter this afternoon, the plaintiff could have been processed, assuming all other things were equal, by 5pm, that is, in some three hours and 25 minutes. The various steps are outlined in exhibit 30 which was admitted as evidence of the facts. The document is headed, ""Particulars to paragraphs 23 (d) and 27 of the amended defence"", and also in the defendant's chronology which has been marked for identification 13 and left with the papers. I have pointed out that according to Senior Constable Barnier, he commenced the fact sheet at about 1.41pm and spent 20 minutes to half hour on it. I have pointed out that despite the evidence of Senior Constable Barnier that it might take up to 20 minutes to complete a Court Attendance Notice, the Court Attendance Notice appears to have been generated in a period of six minutes between 4.44pm and 4.50pm. I do know that the interview with David Daley was from 5.05 to 5.33, according to exhibit 23. Giving Senior Constable Barnier time for a break between 16:15 and 5.05, the interview with David Daley finished at 5.33. If he then continued with the compilation of the fact sheet or finished the compilation of the fact sheet, one would have thought that would have been completed by 6 o'clock and the formalities of charging and bailing could have been completed by 6.18pm. They were not completed until 7.18pm. Accordingly, in my view, the plaintiff was detained for one hour longer than was reasonably necessary. 

163This is no criticism of Senior Constable Barnier at all or of any member of the New South Wales Police serving at Grafton in April or May 2011. The reason that the plaintiff could not be dealt with more promptly was because of understaffing. I could spend an hour outlining the evidence as to understaffing at the Grafton Police Station. There is enough documentary evidence of it. The fact is that the police could not attend to the statutory time limits because of the lack of human resources. 

164As a result of my finding, the plaintiff is entitled to recover some damages, as I understand it. That is, the imprisonment for an hour in excess amounted to a period of false imprisonment. Counsel agree that the amount of time the plaintiff was kept in excessive custody, that is, for an extra hour, amounts to a period of false imprisonment for which she is entitled to recover damages. It is appropriate that the State of New South Wales pay the damages because it is the State of New South Wales that did not provide the resources to the Grafton Police that led to the plaintiff being detained in custody longer than she ought to have been detained.

165 The question then becomes what is the quantum of those damages. The authorities make it clear that the length of time is not of particular significance but the shock of being arrested is and a large amount of damages payable for false imprisonment comes from that initial shock. Here, the initial shock was because of a lawful arrest and, therefore, cannot be part of the wrongful imprisonment. The plaintiff was kept away from her home and her daughters and from what she might normally do for an hour between roughly 6.15 and 7.18pm on the evening of Sunday, 1 May 2011. Minds may differ as to the significance of such a period of custody. Doing the best I can, I assess the plaintiff's compensatory damages in the sum of $2,500. This is not a case in which aggravated damages or exemplary damages ought be awarded. There is nothing that Senior Constable Barnier or any other member of the Grafton Police did that in any way aggravates the damages. The damages arise because of inaction on the part of the police because they were involved with other activities. There is no particular conduct of any member of the police force to be condemned or which the Court should reprimand because the incurring of the damages was caused by a very common problem in our community, a lack of resources of Government to remedy mischief.

166 In my view, interest should run on that sum from 1 May 2011. Commencing on 1 May 2011, the interest rate was 8.75%. That remained the interest rate until 31 December 2011. The interest rate from 1 January 2012 to 30 June 2012 was 8.25%. The interest rate from 1 July 2012 to 31 December 2012 was 7.5%. The interest rate from 1 January 2013 to 30 June 2013 was 7% and the interest rate from 1 July 2013 to today's date is 6.75%. Counsel will kindly work out the interest while I have a rest. 

167 Counsel agree that interest on that amount at the rates prescribed under the rules from 1 May 2011 to date is the sum of $485.32. For those reasons, I give verdict and judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for $2,985.32.

[SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS]

168HIS HONOUR: In the exercise of my discretion, I order the defendant to pay one-third of the plaintiff's costs.

5The Crown lodged an appeal against the inadequacy of this sentence on 12 October 2012. The applicant has appealed against his conviction. The applicant had legal representation in relation to the Crown sentence appeal but was unrepresented in his conviction appeal.

The Crown case at trial

6The complainant ""A"" was born in 1994 and was aged 18 at the time of trial. She had an older brother ""B"", born in 1992 who was aged 20 at the time of trial. Her mother, ""BP"", commenced a relationship with the applicant in the late 1990's and thereafter he moved in with the family. The applicant and BP were married in March 2005 and had a daughter together, ""T"", born in 2006. 

7The complainant gave evidence that the applicant had interfered with her sexually over a period of 3 years from when she was aged 13 through to 16. Her evidence in relation to each count brought against the applicant was as follows.

Count 1 - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent

8In July 2007 the applicant took the complainant, aged 13, to Sydney to attend a Gwen Stefani concert and they shared a room at the ""Spanish Inn Motor Lodge"" in Strathfield for two nights. After they returned from the concert the applicant turned the lights out and gave A some tablets to swallow without telling her what they were. He just said ""trust me"" and she did. After taking them, the complainant said ""goodnight"" to the applicant, gave him a hug and got into the single bed in the room.

9The complainant woke up to find she was in the double bed with the applicant on top of her. Her pants were off and he had no pants/underwear on. The applicant had his penis in the complainant's vagina and was having intercourse with her. She screamed, saying ""stop it, stop it"" and the applicant told her to ""shush"", that she would wake everyone up.

10The complainant was scared and in shock at what was happening. She squirmed around but could not do anything to stop what was happening. The complainant's next memory was the applicant getting off her. She went to the bathroom, closed the door and stayed in there for some time, trying to comprehend what had happened. She was shaking and in shock.

11While in the bathroom, the complainant noticed that she had a green stain on her fingers, apparently from the tablets the applicant had given her to take. The complainant returned to the room and said to the applicant, ""Don't do that again"". He said that he would not and she went to sleep in the single bed. 

12The complainant did not tell anyone at that time. She was scared about what her mother might think and of what the applicant might do and just wanted to move on. 

Count 2 - aggravated indecent assault

13The applicant operated a floor-sanding business at the time and also worked occasionally as a DJ at discos. He would take the complainant with him and from time to time they would stay overnight in his vehicle. Before the applicant disposed of his Toyota Hiace (3 May 2008) the complainant accompanied him in the vehicle to a disco in Lightning Ridge. She was aged 13 or 14 and they stayed overnight in a motel. They shared a room that had only one bed. When the complainant got out of the shower that night, she discovered that her pyjamas which she had left on the side of the sink were wet. 

14The applicant said that her suitcase of clothes in the vehicle had gone missing and gave her one of his t-shirts to wear to bed. She did not have any underclothing. They shared the bed and the applicant rubbed his fingers around the complainant's vagina and bottom. Next morning the applicant claimed to have found her suitcase and the complainant was able to change clothing. 

Count 3 - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent

15On Saturday, 21 February 2009 the applicant took the complainant to a property at Terry Hie Hie for BMcN's twenty first birthday party. B was there also, having travelled out the day before. The applicant decided to leave the party early and go home. He allowed B to stay but insisted on the complainant going with him. On the way back, the applicant pulled off the road somewhere out of Gravesend. He had a mattress in the back of his gold Ford ute and they stayed the night. The applicant had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant in a number of different positions while they were on the mattress.

16They drove back to Inverell early the next morning. The complainant did not tell anyone what was happening. She was scared and the applicant told her on occasions that he did not want the family to break up, that her mother would not want to talk to her, that B would not want anything to do with her and that T would be in DOCS care and the complainant would not see her again.

Counts 4 and 5 - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent

17The complainant (15) accompanied the applicant to Armidale on 17 April 2009 when he was a DJ at a fortieth birthday party at the Armidale Bowling Club. They travelled in the applicant's ute, towing a trailer, and on the way back the applicant pulled off the road. They slept on a mattress that was in the trailer.

18The applicant on this occasion had both penile/anal and penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant. When they were on the mattress, the applicant told the complainant ""we're going to try something different"". He was lying behind her and put his penis into her bottom. She felt massive pain and told him ""stop it, don't do it, it hurts"". He said ""just a bit longer, just a bit longer"" but the complainant kept telling him to stop, saying that it hurt until he stopped. The applicant then had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant.

Count 6 - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent

19The complainant (16) went with the applicant when he was a DJ at a wedding at Glenn Innes on 7 August 2010. They booked into the Glenn Innes Motel and the complainant remained in the room while the applicant went to the reception centre. There was only one bed in the room and the complainant went to bed before the applicant got back. He arrived around midnight and had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant in the bed. They slept the rest of the night, returning home in the morning.

Count 7 - aggravated indecent assault

20On the night of Saturday 30 October 2010, the complainant (16) went to a party at her friend J-L's place in Inverell and was to sleep over. Another of the complainant's friends, a Brazilian girl called Stephanie, also went to the party. The applicant and the complainant's mother came to the house in the early hours of the morning. The complainant then drove the applicant to the hospital because he was not feeling well, while her mother stayed behind and looked after T. 

21While they were in the car, the applicant wanted to know what had happened at the party with Stephanie and felt around the complainant's vagina to see if she was ""wet"". 

Count 8 - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent

22Sometime after that, the complainant went with the applicant to Armidale to visit her ""Pop"", the applicant's stepfather. On the way, the applicant pulled off the road. It was daylight and he put towels on the windows of the ute so no-one could see in.

23The applicant got in the backseat and took his pants off. The complainant was in her school uniform. She got in the back, took her stockings, pants and skirt off and got on top of him with her legs around his. The applicant then had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. The applicant got a phone call from the complainant's mother and he told her they were just coming into Armidale. During the intercourse the applicant told the complainant to talk about what she had done with Stephanie and the complainant made something up for him about Stephanie touching her. 

24Afterwards the complainant wiped herself with a towel, dressed and they continued to Armidale.

Counts 9, 10 and 11 - aggravated sexual intercourse without consent

25On Thursday 16 December 2010, the complainant (16) went with the applicant to Warialda on one of his sanding jobs and they stayed overnight at the ""Sunflower Motel"". They were the only guests at the motel and the applicant selected a room with just one bed in it. The applicant had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant in the bed as soon as they arrived (count 9). He brought food to the room for dinner and gave the complainant tablets to take, popping them in her mouth for her. Thereafter, he had penile/vaginal intercourse with the complainant again (count 10). He told her to think about Stephanie and tell him where she was touched. The complainant told him Stephanie had touched her ""on the breasts, bum and vagina"". Early next morning, the applicant wanted the complainant to give him oral sex. She initially said ""no"", but then relented after the applicant started sweating and shaking and told her he did not think he could drive home. 

26The complainant performed fellatio for a short time and then told the applicant her mouth was sore, but he said ""Oh, just a little bit more"" and continued until he ejaculated in her mouth (count 11). That was the last time the applicant had sexual contact with the complainant.

27In addition to the conduct giving rise to the charges on the indictment, the complainant gave evidence that the applicant had engaged in sexual intercourse with her on many other occasions by the roadside on trips away, or more often in the complainant's bedroom, such intercourse including penile/vaginal, penile/anal and fellatio.

28The applicant began listening to the complainant's conversations using software he installed on her mobile phone and accused her of being a lesbian, of masturbating and even of having sex with her brother B. On 4 February 2011 the complainant's mother, BP, moved out of the home and took the complainant and T with her. They stayed with the complainant's maternal grandparents but BP maintained contact with the applicant and took T to the house for visits with her father.

29On 16 February 2011 the applicant asked that T stay with him overnight and BP agreed. This prompted the complainant to disclose what had been happening to her. The complainant made a formal complaint to the police that evening.

30The applicant was arrested on 21 March 2011. He received legal advice and declined an offer to be interviewed in relation to the allegations. He was thereafter charged.

31The complainant's mother, BP, gave evidence at the trial. This corroborated much of the complainant's evidence as to the specific counts relied upon and the opportunity which the applicant had to commit the offences. 

32Her evidence was that the applicant tended to stay up late and sleep during the day. He had sleep apnoea and was a bad snorer so that he would often take his sleep apnoea equipment into the complainant's room and sleep on a mattress on the floor so he would not disturb BP. In the mornings BP would close off that part of the house so that T would not wake him.

33In relation to the twenty first birthday party (count 3), BP said that the applicant rang her and told her that he would bring the complainant home. Later that night he rang again to say that he was tired and that they were going to stop at the Gravesend truck stop and have a sleep and then come home. The applicant and the complainant arrived home the next morning.

34B gave evidence, which like that of BP, corroborated the complainant's evidence in that it was consistent with opportunities available to the applicant to commit offences against the complainant. He gave evidence of accusations made by the applicant against him to the effect that he was having sexual intercourse with the complainant. Those accusations commenced towards the end of 2010.

35B said that the applicant slept in A's bedroom ""all the time"", which was clarified to mean two or three times a week. He said that they would go to bed before him, or he would wake up in the morning and the applicant was still in A's room sleeping. The applicant would always shut the door and would also shut B's bedroom door. Even when B left his bedroom door open in winter to let in heat from the rumpus room heater, in the morning his bedroom door was always shut.

36Detective Senior Constable Taber was the officer-in-charge of the investigation. She was aware that the complainant had attended the Inverell Police Station with her mother on 16 February 2011. At the time the complainant was observed to be upset, emotional and crying while her mother tried to console her.

37On 23 February 2011 Detective Taber and an Inverell Community Services worker conducted an electronically recorded interview with the complainant. This ERISP was lengthy, comprising 962 questions set out on 90 pages of transcript.

38Detective Taber gave evidence that on 16 May 2011 a forensic procedure was carried out on the complainant which involved a sample of her hair being cut from different locations on her head. The hair sample was sent for toxicology analysis to see if there were any traces of drugs. Detective Taber did not know what she was looking for and so did not ask for any particular drug to be tested for. The results came back negative. 

39Exhibit G was the report of a Mr Hoskings, forensic toxicologist. Included in that report was:

""A request was made to analyse the hair sample for the presence of drugs. The hair sample submitted was approximately 27 centimetres long. Based on this, the 9 centimetres of hair closest to the scalp were analysed as 8 segments relating to about 9 months' growth.

The first segment analysed was 2 centimetres in length and would relate to the approximate timeframe mid March to mid May 2011 inclusive. The remaining 7 segments analysed were each 1 centimetre in length and in total would relate to 7 months' growth and cover the approximate period, mid August 2010 to mid March 2011.

The hair was analysed as requested by liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry for the following drugs, amphetamines, MDMA also known as Ecstasy, methylamphetamine, morphine, codeine, heroin, alprazolam, clonazepam, diazepam, oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone.

Result and Interpretation: 
None of the drugs listed above were detected in any of the hair segments analysed. 

Comments: 
Various drugs become incorporated from the blood into growing hair root, thereafter such drugs remain fixed in that part of the hair as it grows out from the scalp, therefore the hair keeps a history of when a particular drug was taken. If a drug is used infrequently or a single time there may not be enough of the drug incorporated into the hair to be detected.""

40The applicant gave evidence and denied each of the charges put to him. He said that after he stopped doing his courier run in 2005, he started having trouble sleeping. He had suffered from sleep apnoea all his life. Because he did not want to disturb BP's sleep, they agreed that he would sleep in the complainant's room. This occurred most Saturday nights so he could sleep in.

41He denied that any sexual contact had occurred between the complainant and himself on the night of the Gwen Stefani concert on 30 July 2007. He denied giving the complainant any tablets in the motel room. He denied having access to any green tablets at that time. He said that he had access to green tablets from 2009 when he became a carer for his brother. He said that his brother was prescribed Hypnodorm which is a sleeping tablet.

42He said that a few days before 14 January 2011, he had asked B if there was ""anything going on"" between B and the complainant because he had noticed B looking at the complainant in a different way. The applicant said that he decided to ""do a check"" on the complainant and utilised his Spyphone software. He heard what he perceived as ""sexual noises, someone having sex in the background"". He became angry and rang B's phone and told him to get out of the house. This led to a confrontation between the applicant and B and the police were called to the house.

43The applicant said that he suggested that the complainant be examined by a doctor to show that she was a virgin and thus had not had sex with her brother. BP agreed and spoke to the complainant about it. The applicant said that the complainant rang him begging him not to let it happen. He said that the first he became aware that the complainant had made allegations against him was on 16 February 2011 after he was served with an AVO. 

44The applicant said that on one occasion A had entered the bathroom when he was wearing only a shirt. He did not know how much A had seen because he was too embarrassed to ask (this would explain A's evidence that he was not circumcised and in November 2008 had undergone a vasectomy procedure).

The Appeal

45Over a period of time the applicant prepared and served on the Crown 13 Grounds of Appeal. Since Grounds 1, 3, 4 and 5 essentially raise the same issue, they can be dealt with together.

Ground 1 - An abuse of process resulted from the Crown's failure to produce known evidence that the accused did not drug the complainant as it was the same evidence that would have convicted the accused that the drug hair report was positive

Ground 3 - That a miscarriage of justice resulted from the Crown's failure to call certain experts with testimony and/or pharmacology documents to ascertain Hypnodorm as Crown introduced from their own witness.

Ground 4 - His Honour's summing up caused a miscarriage of justice in directing a jury on the use to be made of the drug hair report with clarity and the burden of proof and how to apply it to this crucial evidence.

Ground 5 - An abuse of process by the Crown in closing on the drug hair report, the Crown gave a false direction about evidence from the complainant in direct disparity to the complainant's testimony for had the Crown communicated the complainant's correct testimony, it would have placed the complainant's credibility in an irredeemable position.

46Under Ground 1 the applicant submitted that in her ERISP the complainant said that he had given her tablets on a regular basis, as often as every Saturday night when sexual intercourse occurred. The submission seems to be that had the complainant been cross-examined as to these answers in her ERISP, the answers would have been shown to be false because of the result of the toxicology tests on the complainant's hair.

47The applicant submitted that the Crown failed to fulfil its duty to place all relevant evidence before the jury by not placing before the Court a pharmacology report which set out the pharmacological details of the substance Hypnodorm (otherwise known as Rohypnol). The applicant's submission was that if such a report had been before the jury, it would have shown that the complainant was not telling the truth in her ERISP when she spoke about the many occasions on which she was given tablets by him. The applicant submitted that this would have destroyed the complainant's credit.

48The applicant submitted that by failing to place this information before the jury, the Crown was in effect holding back evidence and he relied on Grey v R [2001] HCA 65; 184 ALR 593 in support of that proposition. Fundamental to these submissions is the proposition that because the toxicology report on the complainant's hair produced a negative result, further testing and further scientific information about Hypnodorm would discredit the complainant.

49The applicant also relied upon evidence given in the voir dire. The applicant's submission was that because the complainant said that she had been given green tablets on multiple occasions and that the green tablets knocked her out, the green tablets must have been Hypnodorm and that if she were telling the truth, the presence of Hypnodorm in her hair would have shown up when her hair sample was tested. The applicant submitted that it was the duty of the Crown Prosecutor to place before the jury evidence which identified the active ingredients of Hypnodorm and to obtain a report which specifically addressed the question of whether the active ingredients of Hypnodorm were present in the hair samples which were tested. 

50The applicant submitted that his Honour's summing up caused a miscarriage of justice because of the way in which he directed the jury about the use to be made of the toxicology report. Implicitly, the applicant submitted that his Honour should have given greater stress to the fact that the toxicology results from the testing of the hair were negative and that this substantially undermined the complainant's evidence.

51The applicant submitted that the Crown's address to the jury was misleading in relation to the effect of the toxicology report on the complainant's evidence about being given tablets by him. The applicant submitted that the Crown was at fault in not bringing to the jury's attention the discrepancy which he said existed between the complainant's answers in the ERISP and the evidence which she gave at trial.

52In order to properly evaluate these submissions it is necessary to set out part of the submissions at trial and to understand how the the trial proceeded.

53Before the trial commenced, the issue of the tablets was dealt with on a voir dire. The applicant's counsel had submitted that the evidence concerning the tablets was more prejudicial than probative and should be excluded. In the course of his judgment, his Honour said:

""HIS HONOUR: Application is made that I exclude evidence that the Crown proposes to elicit from a witness that the accused had access to what has been described as ""green tablets"". The relevance of this is that it is anticipated that the complainant will give evidence that on occasions before she was sexually abused by the accused, she had been given green tablets by him. The Crown anticipates that she will say that she took the tablets not knowing what they were and that after having taken the tablets, she either went to sleep or became unconscious and she was roused from that state by the accused performing these acts upon her.

The Crown wishes to lead the evidence that the accused had access to ""green tablets"" as some evidence supporting the proposition that the complainant says that she had been given ""green tablets"". It seems to me that the Crown is entitled to lead that evidence and nothing beyond it, namely, I do not propose to permit the Crown to lead evidence as to the effect that those tablets may have had upon other people after they had taken those tablets, nor do I propose to permit any opinion as to the nature of those tablets and the effect that those tablets had when taken but it seems to me that the Crown is entitled to lead evidence as to the fact that the accused had access to those tablets and I am of the opinion that the danger of unfair prejudice does not outweigh the probative value of that material."" 

54The evidence of the complainant at trial was that the applicant gave her some tablets to swallow without telling her what they were and just said ""trust me"" and she did. Although she went to bed in the single bed, she woke up in the double bed with the applicant on top of her engaging in penile/vaginal intercourse with her. It was after that event when she was in the bathroom that she observed a green stain on her fingers which she inferred came from the tablets which the applicant had given her to take.

55In chief the only other mention of tablets was in relation to count 10 on the occasion when the applicant brought food to the motel room in Warialda and gave her some tablets to take, popping them in her mouth for her before engaging in penile/vaginal intercourse with her. In chief she gave no other evidence of being given tablets in relation to the other offences.

56The complainant was cross-examined as to the events of the evening of the Gwen Stefani concert in July 2007 which gave rise to the offence in count 1 (T.52-55). In cross-examination she said that after she had showered and was coming out of the bathroom, the applicant was in the doorway of the bathroom, turned out the light and put the tablets in her mouth. She was not sure how many. He handed her a glass of water. She was scared and did not know what he was doing. She did not see a green tablet because it was dark but she saw stains on her fingers. She did not know how she got the stains on her fingers, but was sure it was from the tablets. She did not know how she got into his bed. The next thing she knew she was in it, she woke up and he was on top of her. She was in shock, screamed ""stop"" and then fell asleep or blanked out again. Her next memory was of getting up and going to the bathroom and that was when she saw the green stains on her fingers.

57Later in cross-examination the complainant said that on another occasion she was going somewhere with the applicant, her mother had made a pizza, she got out of the car to close the gate and when she went back she saw that the applicant had sprinkled ""the same green stuff"" on her pizza (T.55-56). She said that the applicant had given her the green tablets ""multiple times"". She recalled being given a tablet when she was coming back from a floor sanding job with him. The next thing she remembered was waking up in the back of the van with the applicant assaulting her. She had the same symptoms (T.57).

58When cross-examined about the trip to Warialda, the complainant recalled going to the motel as soon as they arrived. She said it was late afternoon, still light, when the applicant commenced having penile/vaginal intercourse with her and continued until about 8.30 or 9.30pm. The complainant said that after he brought her something to eat and a Powerade, he had asked her to take tablets with the Powerade. She did not see them. She had asked him on numerous occasions what the tablets were and never got an answer but did not recall if she asked him on this occasion (T.99-100). She agreed that she had told the police that they were not green tablets because she was not knocked out and could remember what happened and so she thought they could not have been green tablets (T.102).

59The complainant denied that her evidence concerning the tablets was a fabrication. At no time did she ever mention the word ""Hypnodorm"", nor did she otherwise identify the tablets.

60RMcN gave evidence that in 2010 he saw the applicant in possession of some green tablets on a number of occasions. The tablets were one centimetre long and oblong in shape. He said that the applicant gave some to him to help him sleep. RMcN did not use the word ""Hypnodorm"", or otherwise identify the tablets.

61The report from the forensic toxicologist has already been set out at [39]. It was tendered without objection by the Crown.

62The first mention of the word ""Hypnodorm"" came in the applicant's evidence. He said that he first had access to green tablets in 2009. The applicant said:

""A. I became carer for my brother, DP, he is roughly three years older than me. He's diagnosed with bi-polar, he is under - he is on the medication Respiridol which he gets an injection once a fortnight and also he is on other tablets for like blood pressure and he also has Hypnodorm, which is a sleeping tablet ...

...

A. Just basically what I had been doing, just sort of keeping an eye on him making sure he is taking his medication, there was an order from a mental institution they call Banksia House in Tamworth, he was ordered to make sure he had his injection once a fortnight so I would either pick up the prescription for him sometimes I would take him to the doctor and sometimes I wouldn't.

Q. Were you assisting him in managing his Hypnodorm medication?
A. That's right, yes.

Q. What did you do with that, in regard to that?
A. Generally once a week I would give him a week's supply and on occasions I mightn't see him for two weeks so I would give him two weeks supply."" (T.289.43 - 290.13)

63Although there was no direct evidence from any witness that the green tablets were Hypnodorm, it was a reasonable inference from the evidence that they were. 

64In submissions the Crown said the following concerning the tablets.

""... The Crown doesn't bear the onus beyond reasonable doubt in relation to every piece of evidence that the Crown puts before you. For example, the Crown doesn't have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused gave A tablets. The Crown doesn't have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that if he did give her tablets, that they were green or that they were Hypodorm, Hypnodorm whatever they would call it. It's only the essential elements and his Honour will give them to you of the charges that the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt"" (14.5.12, T.2.30).

65Later the Crown submitted:

""The green tablets provide support for her I'd suggest to you. She gives evidence that the green tablets were used on more than one occasion, the only time she can really detail and say they were green tablets is at Strathfield, the very first time she can remember anything happening down there for Gwen Stefani. She had the green on her fingers, she was given tablets, it was in the dark, she can't recall and initially she said that she had them in her hand but in cross-examination she said they were given straight to her, put in her mouth, she couldn't recall having them in her hand but at the end of the day she says she can't remember how but she does remember that at some stage she had contact with them with her fingers and there was green.

You know from the evidence that the accused not only had access to these Hypnodorm tablets, that are prescribed for his brother and he's had possession of them, he admits that in his evidence. You've got RMcN coming along saying he had them, they were in the possession of the accused. RMcN went one step further in the last question of cross-examination, not only did he have them he gave me some. Now the accused is careful to say that he only became carer for his brother in 2009 so he didn't have access to them in 2007 but he concedes that his brother's condition was diagnosed as early as 2005, his brother was in Inverell and again you apply your common sense, he has access to his brother because its his brother, it's not a big jump to then conclude he would have had access to the Hypnodorm tablets.

So she's got support there I'd suggest to you, she says he gave me green tablets, he had access to green tablets."" (14.5.12 - T.4.47-5.21)

66Later the Crown Prosecutor said:

""We've got a report from toxicology. The hair sample was taken and I don't know whether this is going to cause you any concern or not, there's no drug shown up in it, perhaps they sent it to the wrong place, if they sent it to CSI Miami, CSI New York they would have been able to tell us that she had a Panadol on any given day. 

But look at the report, you've got it there and the report says that if there's insufficient sample, there's not enough of the drug taken, if it's taken on an infrequent basis then there wouldn't be - expect to be a result. A doesn't say here that he's giving her tablets everyday or every second day or every week, she says she was given tablets on that initial occasion, she gives evidence of tablets on another occasion, once in the van, at the end at Warialda, you wouldn't be too much troubled by the lack of evidence relating to the hair sample. You have to really think about whether A is honest, accurate and reliable."" (14.5.12 - T.6.7 - .21)

67Defence counsel submitted as follows:

""Now I sought to test her evidence, test her honesty, her reliability and her accuracy in cross-examination. In relation to the Gwen Stefani concert incident, she said she was not sure how many pills she was given, she said ""All I remember is the green tablet"". She said she was not sure if all the pills were put in her mouth at once. She was not sure how they were put in her mouth, whether they were put in by palm first or by the index finger and thumb. She couldn't recall if she had been given tablets before. She couldn't remember asking why she was being given tablets. She couldn't remember touching the tablets. She said ""I can't remember how I got the stains on my fingers but it was from the tablet"", and then you'll recall ladies and gentlemen that his Honour asked her some questions about that, she was asked ""This is your evidence, you did not see the green tablet is that right?"", answer ""I didn't see the green tablet no"", question ""And you do not know, you can't now say whether you touched the tablet or not is that right?"", answer ""I touched it at some stage, I don't know when and I don't know how"". Question ""Do you remember doing that?"" Answer ""No, I don't remember touching the green tablet but I know I did"". Question ""Why is that because you had green substance on your fingers the next day?"" Answer ""Because the green tablet has been used multiple times not just once"". Of course there's no other specific allegation of a green tablet being used, apart from when she said there was something green being sprinkled on a pizza at some stage."" (14.5.12 - T.16.1 - 21)

68Later, defence counsel submitted:

""I want to suggest to you ladies and gentlemen that the evidence that you've heard regarding the tablets goes nowhere. The best the complainant can say in regard to the counts on the indictment is that she remembers seeing green stains on the fingers back in July 2007 when she was on the Gwen Stefani - or went to the Gwen Stefani concert. Yet there's no evidence that TDP was prescribed sleeping tablets, that TDP told you that he'd been prescribed anti-depressants, not sleeping tablets, and there's no evidence put before the Court by the Crown to the contrary. Now, of course, he did have access to his brother's medication from 2009 but so what, he had access. There's no evidence of the active ingredient or effect of Hypnodorm, whether its - well what its effect is or how long it takes to take effect or what the active ingredient of Hypnodorm is, and keep in mind that on the complainant's version there was no tablets alleged to be used at Lightning Ridge, on the way home from the McN 21st birthday party at Gravesend, on the way home from Armidale disco or at the motel at Glenn Innes after the wedding, there's no mention of tablets on those occasions. If tablets weren't required on those occasions by TDP to have sexual intercourse with A, why would he need or why would she need to be given tablets on other occasions, it just doesn't make sense, and of course she alleges more tablets were given at Warialda before the second lot of penile/vaginal sex but they had no effect."" (14.5.12 - T.26.2-.23)

69The only mention of tablets by the trial judge in his summing up was:

""She can remember specific incidents and they reflect themselves in the indictment itself. He says to you, in the context of that scenario, is it unsurprising that she might not be able to remember every collateral particular of each of the incidents which give rise to the charges within the indictment. What she can remember the Crown says to you are the things that are startling about the incidents. She can remember for instance the first time, when she came down to Sydney to the concert of Gwen Stefani. She remembered that incident. He says to you, that is a startling thing that you might remember, first of all because it was a treat coming down for the concert and, secondly, it was the first time it had occurred and the Crown says to you perhaps she might remember greater particularity in relation to that incident. He says to you that one particular, just by way of example, is that she was given some pills. There is a dispute and there is a divergence in her evidence as to the circumstances, how she came to take the pills, whether they were forced into her mouth or placed in her mouth and the like, and how she came to touch the pills, but she said she took some pills and her evidence in relation to that particular instance was that she woke up with the accused on top of her having sexual intercourse with her."" (SU 32.7 - 33.4)

70The applicant's submissions overlap to a large extent. Underlying Grounds 1, 3, 4 and 5 is the submission that the Crown should have placed before the jury an expert report setting out the pharmacological ingredients of Hypnodorm and also setting out its effects. His submission is that had this evidence been before the jury, it would have enabled defence counsel to substantially discredit the complainant. The applicant also wishes to place this evidence before the Court in the appeal. The basis for the tender is that this evidence should have been called by the Crown at trial and if it were placed before this Court, it would demonstrate the unreliability of the complainant.

71That submission fails on a number of bases. Defence counsel successfully objected to the Crown adducing any evidence as to the makeup and identity of any tablets given by the applicant to the complainant and as to their possible effect upon her. This was the result of the ruling made by the trial judge, following the voir dire on that issue. To accept the applicant's submission would be contrary to the stance adopted by the applicant at trial and should not be allowed. 

72In any event, the premise on which the submission is based is not made out, i.e., that further scientific information would strengthen the position of the applicant and discredit the testimony of the complainant. The evidence before the jury was that Exhibit G, the toxicology report, showed that none of the specified drugs had been found in the hair of the complainant, which had been tested. However, the testing only covered the period March 2011 back to August 2010. So far as it went, that negative result favoured the applicant. 

73Because of the limitations in the testing (the hair length tested), a result for the period before August 2010 could not be obtained. In other words, the toxicology test results said nothing about whether Hypnodorm had been given to the complainant between July 2007 (the incident giving rise to count 1) and August 2010. There was no evidence at trial of any green tablets/ Hypnodorm being given to the complainant between August 2010 and 16 December 2010 (being the last date on which there was any sexual contact between the complainant and the applicant). Accordingly, evidence of the type identified by the applicant, whether it was before the jury during the trial or before this Court, would not advance his case.

74No basis was established for the acceptance of such evidence by this Court. Putting the applicant's submission at its highest, such evidence would be ""new"" evidence. The principles in R v Abou-Chabake [2004] NSWCCA 356; 149 A Crim R 417 would apply. In that case, Kirby J (with whom Mason P and Levine J agreed) identified seven principles which apply to the admission of new evidence (at [63]). The admission of the new evidence specified by the applicant does not get close to complying with those principles. To be admissible such new evidence would have to support a finding that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. This could only be found if the evidence was so cogent as to satisfy the Court as to the applicant's innocence or raise a reasonable doubt as to the applicant's guilt. The proposed evidence does not satisfy that test.

75Finally, the applicant's submission assumes in his favour that the toxicology report, Exhibit G, demonstrated the absence of any Hypnodorm in the complainant's hair. That is not necessarily so. Rohypnol is the generic brand name for Hypnodorm. The drug itself is called Flunitrazepam. That is not one of the drugs for which the complainant's hair was tested in the toxicology report. It is not known whether, if the complainant's hair had been tested for Flunitrazepam, it would have produced a positive result.

76It follows that the evidence at trial favoured the applicant. It was never suggested at trial that the toxicology report might not have been capable of detecting Hypnodorm. Further testing and further scientific evidence would not have assisted the applicant's case and may well have weakened it.

77Fundamental to these Grounds of Appeal is the proposition that further scientific evidence would have enabled the complainant's credibility to be successfully challenged if she had been cross-examined as to what she said about tablets in her ERISP. There were, however, significant dangers for the applicant arising from such cross-examination. In her ERISP the complainant had described regular sexual intercourse with the applicant, often several times per week over three years, which on many occasions was accompanied by the applicant giving her tablets. Cross-examination as to what the complainant said in her ERISP concerning tablets would have only emphasised to the jury the frequency of the applicant's offending. The prejudice for the applicant associated with such an approach far outweighed the possible gain.

78There was no obligation on the part of the Crown to adduce evidence concerning Hypnodorm. This was particularly so when the identity of that substance was introduced into the trial by the applicant. There is no basis for the submission that the Crown was holding back evidence, such as occurred in Grey v R. It was, of course, open to the defence to call such evidence. For the reasons set out above, however, there were very good reasons for the defence not doing so and for not wishing to draw the jury's attention to the tablet issue in any significant way.

79The emphasis given to the tablet issue by the applicant in these grounds of appeal ignores the fact that the tablets formed a very small part of the evidence at trial. This can be seen from the treatment of them by both the Crown and defence counsel in submissions. The importance for the Crown was that the giving of the tablets on the night of the Gwen Stefani concert enabled the complainant to identify with some precision the date upon which the offence in count 1 occurred. The evidence concerning the tablets was incidental to the Crown case and did not form an important part of it.

80There is no basis for the submission that his Honour's reference to the tablets caused a miscarriage of justice. His Honour's reference to the tablets in his summing up did no more than illustrate to the jury how it was that the complainant was able to remember details of particular offences.

81Similarly, as can be seen from the parts of the Crown address set out at [64], [65] and [66] there is no basis for the submission that the Crown misled the jury as to the effect of the toxicology report.

82These grounds of appeal have not been made out.

Ground 2 - His Honour's summing up caused a miscarriage of justice in relation to charge 8. ""Nothing was put to you by Mr Carty to suggest to you that if that is what happened, it was not an indecent act"". His Honour's direction was predicated and was a negation of Mr Carty's (defence) summing up. Mr Carty asserted twice ""She couldn't remember any conversation"" and Mr Carty stated ""In my submission it sounds implausible"" and ""much of her evidence is vague, much of it just doesn't ring true"". This clearly shows a clear misdirection by his Honour, prejudice to the accused. In comparison to the trial his Honour's direction was not an intelligible sequence or directed with clarity, it was prejudiced to the accused.

83Although the applicant has referred to charge 8, it is clear from the way in which he has expressed this Ground of Appeal that he is referring to the offence in count 7. Count 7 comprised a charge of aggravated indecent assault which occurred on the night of Saturday 30 October 2010, when the complainant was aged 16 and went to a party at a friend's place at Inverell.

84In the summing up the trial judge said in relation to count 7:

""You will recall, that the circumstances in which this act happened, was when she had been to the sleepover at a friend's place. The evidence was that the accused had a splitting headache at the time and wanted to go to the hospital; that the complainant was contacted and picked up and there were various discussions which led eventually to her driving him to the hospital. They remained in the car outside the hospital. There is evidence in relation to what happened in the car, and the allegation that the Crown makes is that at that time the accused put his hands into her pants and felt her vagina. That of course is denied by the accused, but again the fact finding exercise in relation to that is entirely for you. But those are the circumstances in which it occurred.

You might conclude that if you find that the accused did that, then you will have no trouble in determining that the act itself was an indecent act, and nothing was put to you by Mr Carty to suggest to you that if that is what happened, it was not an indecent act."" (SU 23.5)

85The applicant submitted that his Honour did not make it sufficiently clear that this incident was controversial and denied by the applicant. 

86The applicant submitted that the complainant's failure to remember whether she had a conversation with him ""about accusations of you having sex with Stephanie or any sexual contact with Stephanie when you and TDP were in the car going or arriving at the hospital"" meant that the Crown had failed to prove ""an indispensable link"" in the chain of reasoning towards the inference of guilt in relation to charge 7.

87There is no substance in this Ground of Appeal. The role of a judge in a criminal trial is to direct the jury about how the Crown seeks to make out its case and to put fairly the case which the accused makes. In AP v R [2013] NSWCCA 189 Leeming JA said:

""16 Counsel appearing for the accused was much better placed than this Court on appeal to assess whether a fair trial required the judge to say more than had already been said. On any view, this was a relatively straightforward trial, objectively speaking. The impression obtained from reading the record and in particular the closing addresses is that both counsel proceeded on the basis that the jury understood the fairly obvious issues for them to decide: did they have a reasonable doubt based on the denials of the accused and his sister? Were they persuaded to a very high standard of the truth of the evidence of a young girl? Was there sufficient doubt as to the DNA methodology and the possibility of indirect transfer? However, a transcript cannot fully convey the extent to which it was obvious to the judge and those present in the court that all members of the jury appeared either to understand or to fail to understand the significance of the evidence and the issues for their determination. That reflects part of the policy underlying r 4, as to which, as was said in R v Germakian [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 by Giles JA, Hulme and Hislop JJ at [10]:

""The requirements of r 4 do not constitute some mere technicality which may simply be brushed aside"".

17 Further, as the Court added at [13].

""[L]eave under r 4 will only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings: R v Tripodina (at 195) or as Mahoney JA said in R v Jeffrey (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 December 1993, unreported), at 7, followed in R v DH [2000] NSWCCA 360: '...unless there be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at the trial and unless the possibility of real injustice appears, an accused should be held to what was done by or for him at trial level'.""

18 Against this, Mr Taylor, who appeared for the applicant, candidly conceded that there was no explanation why counsel who appeared at the trial did not raise the matter, but pointed to what had occurred in Wong v R [2009] NSWCCA 101, where the same ground of appeal was taken. At that trial, the judge had asked at the conclusion of the summing up whether there was anything else counsel wanted him to say, and was told there was not (see at [126]), and yet Campbell JA, with the agreement of Grove and Howie JJ, after being taken to Germakian, concluded (at [145]) (emphasis in original):

""No explanation was provided, at the hearing of the appeal, as to why the objections were not taken at trial. Counsel for the appellant at the trial was an experienced criminal lawyer. Those two matters are ones that frequently count against leave being granted under Rule 4. Even so, the deficiency in the summing up in the present case is, in my view, one that is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. There are repeated statements of high authority that the defence case must be put to the jury, and the jury must be instructed about how the law applies to that case.""

The statements of high authority included RPS v R [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at [41], R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76] and [82]-[86] and Condon (1995) 83 A Crim R 335 at 347-348. 

19 Campbell JA raised for consideration, but did not need to determine, whether there might be occasions where, despite the concurrence of counsel, the power in s 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to dispense with a summary of the evidence, might not be available. The reason his Honour did not need to determine that point was because, as was said in [147] (emphasis added):

""While there are circumstances in which this court might decide that the failure of a trial judge to refer to certain items of evidence, or to relate certain items of evidence to the accused's case, was so serious that the judge could not have validly exercised his or her discretion under section 161, it is not necessary to decide whether the present case is such a case. That is because the failure to put the accused's case to the jury at all, and to apply the law to that case, is a sufficient reason why the conviction cannot stand.""

20 There is, to my mind, a tension between the two lines of authority reflected in Germakian and Wong. On the one hand, it is said in Germakian that there must be a convincing reason for the point not being taken and the possibility of real injustice. On the other hand, and more recently, and after reference to Germakian but without squarely explaining why it was inapplicable, it has been said that failing to put the defence case to the jury by itself is appellable error.

21 So far as I can see, Wong has never been followed in any superior court in Australia. On the other hand, the principles in Germakian have repeatedly been endorsed and applied, including at the appellate level: see ARS v R [2011] NSWCCA 266 at [148] (Bathurst CJ, James and Johnson JJ agreeing) and FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [72] (RA Hulme J, McClellan CJ at CL and Schmidt J agreeing). Those later decisions have not addressed the potentially divergent approach in Wong.

22 However, in my opinion, it is not necessary, and therefore not appropriate, to resolve that tension in order to determine this application. This is not a case like Wong, where it was found that there was complete failure to put the defence case to the jury. 

23 The ultimate question is whether the summing up as a whole fairly puts before the jury the case of the accused. In RPS v R Gaudron ACJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ said at [41]:

""The fundamental task of a trial judge is, of course, to ensure a fair trial of the accused. ... It will require the judge to put fairly before the jury the case which the accused makes.""

And the question of the fairness of the trial is a question of substance, rather than form. It is influenced by the nature of the issues, the nature of the case of the accused and the length of the trial.""

88The applicant's counsel in his address to the jury specifically referred to the complainant's evidence in relation to counts 7 and 8 and pointed out the inconsistencies, both in relation to detail and in relation to timing (14.5.2012, T.18.5-.36). The thrust of defence counsel's attack was the implausibility of the evidence and its vagueness as to detail and timing. There could be no doubt that the nature of the applicant's challenge to the complainant's evidence in relation to counts 7 and 8 was fully put by his counsel to the jury. 

89The applicant's accusation concerning Stephanie was not an indispensable link in the chain of reasoning towards guilt in relation to count 7. The indispensable evidence was that of the complainant as to what had occurred in the car. Its acceptance depended upon the jury's assessment of the honesty and reliability of the complainant.

90Ground of Appeal 2 has not been made out.

Ground 6 - An abuse of process by Crown asserting evidence in disparity to complainant. ERISP and trial testimony regarding charges 9 and 10. Ground asserts 31 October to 16 December 2010 to visit Pop in Armidale. From mother's testimony Pop stayed until at least 14 November 2010. The complainant's ERISP ""definitely not near Christmas"", and trial testimony ""end of winter sort of?? (2010)"".

Ground 9 - It was not open to the jury to convict on charges 9 and 10. The element 11 ""that at the time and place"" was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.

91These Grounds of Appeal raise the same issue and can be dealt with together. The applicant appears to have mistakenly referred to Counts 9 and 10 when the Grounds of Appeal are directed to Count 8. 

92The applicant relies upon the contents of the complainant's ERISP in support of Ground 6. The ERISP was not before the jury. As already indicated, there were good reasons why most of the ERISP was not dealt with in cross-examination. The ERISP made it clear that the frequency and extent of the applicant's offending was considerably greater than that encompassed by the 11 counts with which he had been charged. The prejudicial effect for the applicant of the ERISP going before the jury far outweighed any cross-examination benefits which might have been gained.

93Count 8 identified the time of the offending as between 31 October and 16 December 2010. The particular occasion was identified as a visit to ""Pop"" in Armidale. The party which Stephanie also attended was on 30 October 2010. Even if, as the applicant submitted, Pop stayed until 14 November 2010 the offending still occurred within the timeframe specified in count 8.

94It follows that if Grounds of Appeal 6 and 9 refer to count 8 they have not been made out. If they refer to counts 9 and 10 they also fail because of the evidence of Mr Goodhew, who was the owner of the motel at Warialda. His evidence was that the applicant booked a double room in the motel for the evening of 16 December 2010.

Ground 7 - His Honour caused a miscarriage of justice by not addressing a material fact entered as contextual evidence that was predicated as a lead up to help the jury to believe the accused had motive and cause to commit an indecent act. In relation to charge 8.

95The applicant appears to have again confused count 8 with count 7. This ground of appeal appears to relate to count 7.

96Based on his analysis of the complainant's evidence in relation to count 7, the applicant submitted that ""the complainant's credibility is irredeemable"". He submitted that the complainant's inability to remember what happened at the party with Stephanie was implausible and that there was no explanation for why he would say ""Did you do anything with Stephanie?"". Allowing for the applicant's lack of legal training, the effect of the submission seems to be that the complainant's evidence was so inconsistent that a warning should have been given pursuant to s165(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 generally. The applicant relied upon the case of R v Williams [1999] NSWCCA 9; 104 A Crim R 260.

97In particular the applicant relied upon the following statements of principle:

""Warning concerning evidence of complaint

(4) It is not customary to give a direction that the complainant's ""evidence"" must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. What must be proved beyond reasonable doubt are the elements of the offence charged. The judge gave an appropriate direction.

(5) A direction pursuant to s165 of the Evidence Act may be required (notwithstanding no request was made by counsel) where the judge assesses that the evidence may be ""unreliable"". The matters identified in s165(1) are not exhaustive. Here, a sufficient warning to assess the complainant's evidence with care was given. Vawdrey (CCA NSW 16 April 1998), Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12, considered.

(6) The trial judge should ensure the jury has sufficient guidance in taking relevant matters into account. However the extent of the guidance depends on the length and complexity of the trial. Here it was unnecessary for the trial judge to have undertaken a comprehensive analysis. RJC (CCA NSW 1 October 1998), Domican (1992) 173 CLR 561, Condon (1995) 83 ACR 335, considered."" 

98It should be noted that this is not in fact a statement from R v Williams but rather is taken from the head note to that decision. The propositions noted in these paragraphs of the head note can be found in the judgment of Wood CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and McInerney J agreed) at [33]-[34] and [38]-[39].

99This ground of appeal has not been made out. There was no occasion for any warning pursuant to s165 of the Evidence Act. The effect of the complainant's evidence as to the offences giving rise to the 11 counts with which the applicant was charged was sufficiently clear. 

100In any event, the warning given by his Honour in relation to the complainant's evidence was strong and comprehensive. Part of that warning was:

""Whenever the Crown seeks to establish the guilt of an accused person with a case based largely or exclusively on a single witness, it is important that the jury are told that they should exercise caution. That is what I am going to tell you now. You must consider each case separately and this direction applies of course to each case separately. So you must apply this direction when considering the evidence of the complainant, when considering each count. The Crown concedes that its case depends upon the complainant. You must exercise caution before you convict the accused, because as I say, the Crown case largely depends on you accepting the reliability of the evidence of a single witness in each of the cases. This being so, unless you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is an honest and accurate witness in the account you are given, you cannot find the accused guilty. Before you can convict the accused, you should examine the evidence of the complainant very carefully in order to satisfy yourselves that you can safely act upon that evidence to the high standard required in a criminal trial...."" (SU 30.9 - 31.6)

That warning was repeated elsewhere in the summing up. Nothing further was required.

101The jury had an opportunity to observe both the complainant and the applicant give evidence over an extended period during the trial. Both the Crown Prosecutor and defence counsel addressed the jury as to discrepancies in the evidence of each of them. This was the sort of case where the observation of McHugh J in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 534 has particular relevance:

""63 It is the everyday experience of the courts that honest
witnesses are frequently in error about the details of events. The
more accounts that they are asked to give the greater is the chance that there will be discrepancies about details and even
inconsistencies in the various accounts. Of course, it is legitimate
to test the honesty or accuracy of a witness's evidence by analysing the discrepancies and inconsistencies in his or her accounts of an incident. In a case where accuracy of recollection is vital - such as the account of a conversation in a fraud case or the description of a person where identity is the issue - discrepancies and inconsistencies in the witness's account may make it impossible to accept that person's evidence, no matter how honest he or she appears to be. But in other cases, discrepancies and inconsistencies may be of far less importance if the honesty of the witness, as opposed to the accuracy of the detail, is the crucial issue. If a jury thinks that the demeanour of the witness or the probability of occurrence of the witness's general account is persuasive, they may reasonably think that discrepancies or even inconsistencies concerning details are of little moment.""

102This Ground of Appeal has not been made out.

Ground 8 - In relation to charge 8, an abuse of process by a Crown fabricating context evidence to fit in a time line ""whilst in the car"" that was not supported by complainant's ERISP and the ERISP is in disparity to the Crown's enactment of context evidence.

103The applicant in this ground has again confused count 8 with count 7. 

104As indicated, in relation to other Grounds of Appeal there were very good reasons why the contents of the complainant's ERISP did not go into evidence. There were equally good reasons why the complainant was cross-examined as to only part of the responses given by her in the ERISP. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 10 - Corroboration. His Honour caused a manifest miscarriage of justice under s165(1)(c) and (2) not highlighting the suggested weakness in the prosecution case that the defence identified as the brother exaggerated his memory of what was occurring the house. Closing his Honour at T.34: Highlights the Crown, says complainant is corroborated by others, for instance her brother as being in her room frequently with the door shut, afternoons and evenings and consistent with complainant's rendition of events.

Evidence from complainant and mother all that is relevant, will be presented to prove the Crown misled and his Honour misled the jury.

105This Ground of Appeal is directed to the trial judge's directions as to corroboration. When summarising the Crown case in the summing up, his Honour said:

"" ... and you might remember the particular incident, but you might not reasonably be asked to recall the surrounding circumstances. The same here, the Crown says to you here there are eleven instances plucked out of a relationship between the two of them where sexual conduct was not uncommon between the two of them and it would be difficult to really expect her to recall all this collateral detail, except for the matters you would expect her to remember, namely the nature of the sexual conduct of the accused towards the complainant. He says that she was unshaken in cross-examination on the core topics. True enough there are some diffuse renditions of matters both to the police and in her own evidence before you, or a comparison between what she told the police and what she told you, but not on the central topics of what happened to her.

He says that she is corroborated to some extent by others. For instance, her brother who the Crown says to you, you would find an impressive witness, Her brother gives evidence about the accused being in her room frequently with the door shut, both in the afternoons and in the evenings and that is consistent with the complainant's rendition of events. Similarly just before the complaint was made, he gives fairly stark evidence the Crown says to you, in terms of what was happening in the household at the time. He was being thrown out and allegations were being made about sexual conduct between him and his sister. The Crown says to you, bear all that in mind, not so much as direct evidence of what the Crown says the accused did to the complainant, but as evidence from which you might conclude, what was the accused really up to at this stage. Was he trying to cover his tracks and create a false explanation as to how it is that any medical examination for example, would reveal in fact that the complainant has been engaging in sexual intercourse, not at the hands of the accused but he sets up a reason: sexual intercourse with her brother.

Beyond that of course, and this is not particularly her brother's evidence, but her mother's evidence that for some time prior to the end of 2010, the accused the Crown says to you had been white anting the complainant, by saying to her mother ""she's a liar, she tells untruths"" and the like. The Crown says to you, you might conclude, that is part of a concerted scheme on the part of the accused, to set up what would be his explanation should things come undone, as far as he is concerned, as they have, and be able to point to someone else and say, well that is how it happened, not the way the Crown is now saying it did."" (SU 33.5 - 34.9)

106His Honour did not repeat what the Crown said in relation to the evidence in support of each count on the indictment but gave a summary of the defence case in a similar manner:

""Mr Carty, again eloquently addressed you on behalf of the accused and again hopefully I will not trample over his oratory in my regurgitation of what he had to say to you. In essence as I have said to you, the accused's case is that it did not happen, I did not do it, true it is that I had a close relationship with my step-daughter; that I was very concerned about her welfare; there had been the incidents of course of the stalking episode, which is undoubted, where she was being stalked and somebody was arrested in relation to it. So it is put to you on the basis that it is not without foundation that there would be some concerns on the accused's part about the welfare of his step-daughter. True it is that he was in her room frequently, he was helping her with her homework from time to time and that is the reason he was doing it. Why was he going into her room? It is put to you that that is not disputed by the complainant, that he did assist with her homework and he was in the room with her in the afternoons and what is put to you is that there was a sound reason for him going to sleep in her room as well. His wife and the child were in the front room, the complainant's young sister was born. He was a ferocious snorer apparently, which is something that as I understand it, the complainant could tolerate and he slept in the room there, so as either not to disturb his wife and his daughter when she was born. It happened from time to time during the week and that is why he was there.

What is put to you by Mr Carty on his behalf is why should you reject that explanation? There is solid foundation for the fact, certainly a solid foundation for the proposition that he was a big snorer, everybody says so, his wife says so, the complainant says so, the complainant's brother says so and the reason why he was in the room sleeping is apparently that was a more convenient way of going about it.

Similarly what is put to you is that a lot of the things that are said about the conduct of the complainant, the collateral conduct of her is described by her brother and mother, in fact are matters which are simply typical of a teenager, namely long hours sleeping, looking tired all the time and slothing around the house is hardly unique to a teenager in this particular household.

He says importantly you will bear this in mind, that the girl's mother had no suspicions at all, and it came to her like a thunder clap she says, when the allegations were made by the complainant at the beginning of 2011 and is that not a fair barometer as to whether it was happening or not. If the girls' own mother did not suspect a thing and in full knowledge of where they were travelling and full knowledge of the fact that the accused was in the complainant's bedroom frequently and at night and slept there and that they would stay overnight at various places around the countryside, no matter how far or close they were to Inverell, gave no cause for concern to his wife in relation to her daughter's welfare. And she did not express any concern or any surprise that they might sleep over at a particular place, albeit that it was relatively close to Inverell.

Mr Carty says on behalf of the accused, again who knows him best, his wife, as to why he might sleep over. Apparently from her perspective, the complainant was expressing no particular concerns about going out on these jobs or the disco, whether it be the sanding jobs or the disco jobs from time to time and he says to you, without that express reluctance on her part, it seems rather inconsistent with somebody who is being almost constantly sexually abused by this man, if she goes largely without any protest of any sort, over all these years.

Mr Carty finally says to you that he is a man of good character. He has never been charged with a criminal offence before and he jumps in the witness box and says ""I didn't do it."" So you will assess him in terms of the fact of a man of good character, he denies having done it in the context of the entirety of the evidence."" (SU35.8 - 37.9)

107In support of this Ground of Appeal, the applicant referred to pieces of evidence from witnesses in the Crown case in order to show contradictions. It would serve no useful purpose to set out each of those instances. There may well be contradictions established. The evidence to which the applicant referred, however, is evidence which goes to incidental matters, not to the matters which had to be proved by the Crown in order for the offences to be proved. There were, as both counsel submitted, discrepancies in the evidence of both the complainant and the applicant. It was a matter for the jury to assess the evidence of the witnesses and determine which evidence they accepted. The summing up by the trial judge did not favour either side. All appropriate warnings were given by the trial judge, particularly relating to delay in complaint and absence of corroboration. This Ground of Appeal has not been made out.

Ground 11 - A miscarriage of justice by Crown in closing. This ground has encompassed in it, an abuse of process. The Crown to fabricate the unfolding of events around ""control"", ""become"" and ""A says"". Also revealed credibility of complainant falling away and gives support for the accused, around these events from mother and brother. The jury were perverted away from the natural course of evidence from the trial around this ground's events. ""Grounds for reasonable doubt does exist"".

108The submissions of the applicant supporting this ground repeated the submissions already made as to discrepancies and inconsistencies which the applicant said existed in the evidence, not only of the complainant but also of her brother and mother. What the applicant does not do is identify anywhere in the Crown's address to the jury an assertion of fact which was not supported by evidence. 

109This Ground of Appeal has not been made out.

Ground 12 - Under s319 intent and s312 pervert. Subsumed from Grounds 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 and Ground 11. And ERISPs and trial testimonies. The Crown did with intent and during the course of justice and prior to the enactment of charges, did pervert the course of justice.

110In support of this Ground of Appeal, the applicant asserted but did not substantiate that submissions made by the Crown were not supported by evidence. This Ground of Appeal has not been made out.

Ground 13 - Incompetent counsel requiring appellate intervention.

111The applicant submitted that he was incompetently represented by defence counsel because defence counsel did not obtain information about Hypnodorm, failed to object to leading questions, failed to object to repetitive questions by both the Crown Prosecutor and trial judge, failed to correct the Crown's closing address and failed to ask for redirections regarding corroboration.

112The relevant principles are set out in Salmon v R [2012] NSWCCA 119 at [127] - [128]:

""127 In Monteiro v R [2011] NSWCCA 113 Simpson J, with whom Hoeben and Price JJ agreed, said -

""[155] The principles applicable to the determination of a ground of appeal raising alleged incompetence of counsel were settled in R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677. Those principles include:

""2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 

3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of 'flagrant incompetence' of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention."" (p 685, per Gleeson CJ.) 

[156] Earlier, Gleeson CJ had said:

""As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to what witnesses to call, what questions to ask or not to ask, what lines of argument to pursue and what points to abandon, are all matters within the discretion of counsel and frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to tactics. The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case."" (p 683) 

[157] The Chief Justice cited, and plainly accepted, a passage from Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, Vol 3(1), par 518 at 420 which is in the following terms:

""... a barrister is ordinarily instructed on the implied understanding that he is to have complete control over the way in which the case is conducted. Unless and until his instructions are withdrawn, counsel has, with regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, unlimited authority to do whatever he considers best for the interests of his client. This authority extends to all matters relating to the action, including the calling and cross-examination of witnesses, challenging a juror, deciding what points to take, choosing which of two inconsistent defences to put forward, and even to agreeing to a compromise of the action, or to a verdict, order or judgment."" (p 684) 

[158] The decision in Birks was essentially endorsed by the High Court in TKWJ v R [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124. There, Gleeson CJ said:

""16 It is undesirable to attempt to be categorical about what might make unfair an otherwise regularly conducted trial. But, in the context of the adversarial system of justice, unfairness does not exist simply because an apparently rational decision by trial counsel, as to what evidence to call or not to call, is regarded by an appellate court as having worked to the possible, or even probable, disadvantage of the accused. For a trial to be fair, it is not necessary that every tactical decision of counsel be carefully considered, or wise. And it is not the role of a Court of Criminal Appeal to investigate such decisions in order to decide whether they were made after the fullest possible examination of all material considerations. Many decisions as to the conduct of a trial are made almost instinctively, and on the basis of experience and impression rather than analysis of every possible alternative. That does not make them wrong or imprudent, or expose them to judicial scrutiny. Even if they are later regretted, that does not make the client a victim of unfairness. It is the responsibility of counsel to make tactical decisions, and assess risks.'"" 

128 Hunt CJ at CL made observations to similar effect in Ignjatic v R (1993) 68 A Crim R 333 at 336: 

""Counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted. Decisions as to which witnesses should or should not be called, what questions should or should not be asked, which lines of argument should be pursued, which points should be abandoned and which of two or more inconsistent defences should be raised are all matters within the discretion of counsel, and they frequently involve difficult problems of judgment, including judgment as to the best tactics to be adopted. Neither disobedience of instructions or even incompetence is sufficient of itself to attract appellate intervention. It is only when the error made was of such a nature in the circumstance of the case as to have led to a miscarriage of justice that this court will interfere.""""

113I have already indicated why there was no miscarriage of justice in failing to adduce more evidence concerning Hypnodorm. There was simply no basis from which it can be argued that such additional evidence would have helped the applicant and good reason to think that it would not.

114Apart from an assertion by the applicant of a failure to object to leading questions and repetitive questions by the Crown and the trial judge, no examples of this have been identified by the applicant. On my reading of the transcript, the questions by the Crown and by the trial judge could not be characterised as repetitive, let alone oppressive. The Crown was allowed to lead evidence by leading questions on issues which were uncontroversial. That is usual in any well conducted trial. On issues which were disputed, however, objection was taken and the evidence was adduced in the correct form.

115There is no substance in the applicant's criticism of defence counsel in failing to seek directions concerning the Crown's closing address and in relation to his Honour's summing up as to corroboration. Just because the applicant disagreed with evidence given against him did not make it improper for the Crown to refer to and rely upon that evidence in his closing address. In relation to corroboration, it was not necessary for the trial judge to sum up otherwise than he did, i.e. to state the principle and its importance and to give examples from the evidence of where corroboration existed. 

116This ground of appeal has not been made out.

117There are two additional matters which I should deal with. The first relates to rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. That rule provides:

""4 No direction, omission to direct, or a decision as to the admission or rejection of evidence given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal or an application for leave to appeal unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction, omission or decision by the party appealing or applying for leave to appeal.""

118Most of the Grounds of Appeal relied upon by the applicant required leave under rule 4. Because the applicant was not legally represented in the conviction appeal, I have dealt with each Ground of Appeal on its merits in more detail than would usually be required. It should be noted, however, that in relation to most of the Grounds of Appeal, leave would not have been granted under rule 4 because the point was not taken at trial (often for a good reason) and no ""arguable case"" has been made out that the Judge made an error of law, or that the applicant's conviction involved a miscarriage of justice (Papakosmas v R [1999] HCA 37; 196 CLR 297 per McHugh J at [72]).

119Because none of the Grounds of Appeal have been made out, the second matter does not, strictly speaking, arise. Given the nature of the issue, however, it is appropriate that I say something about it.

120The background is that following his conviction, the applicant made admissions to Ms Hopkins, a psychologist who saw him for the purpose of being able to prepare a report for use in the sentence proceedings. The admissions made by the applicant appear to be voluntary. The report recorded:

""Mr P was advised that the purpose of the assessment was to provide a report to the Court and that what he disclosed at interview would not remain confidential. He accordingly provided written consent for the information given to be used in the report.""

121The relevant admissions in the report were:

""Mr P informed me that he has had approximately five sexual partners throughout his life, three of whom were in the context of intimate relationships, one being the victim in the current offences and the last being a prostitute he had intercourse with on one occasion in his early twenties.

...

I questioned him regarding this discrepancy and he indicated that it was not that he was attracted to younger people, but that he was specifically attracted to his stepdaughter. 

...

He informed me that he believed his stepdaughter was a willing participant in the sexual contact and it was his perception that she wanted to engage in this behaviour with him given that she ""never said no"". I informed Mr P that consent also referred to the fact that even if a child appears to consent by not saying no to sexual behaviour this is arbitrary, given that children are not cognitively sophisticated enough to make adult-like decisions about engaging in sexual behaviour. He said ""I was aware of that but I didn't think about it"".

...

Mr P reported that he was found guilty of the offences. He indicated that the offending behaviour ""was not planned"". He noted that at the time of the offences, he was experiencing emotional problems, including anxiety and low moods. Mr P advised that he had developed what he perceived to be an intimate bond with his stepdaughter and felt that he could always talk to her and had a good relationship with her. He noted that this led to sexual behaviour which continued for three years and which he apparently believed she was a willing participant in. Indeed Mr P indicated that he perceived his relationship with the victim as that of a friend rather than a father and he reported to me that he did not perceive her as his daughter. He indicated that he felt ""love"" for the victim and that the offences were engaged in out of a sense of intimacy rather than in order to achieve sexual gratification. He said that the offending behaviour included oral, vaginal and anal sexual intercourse and it seems that he used the relationship with his stepdaughter in order to groom her into different sexual acts, by removing her from her mother and taking her to hotels or remote areas, alone where she could not seek help. Mr P advised me that he felt that the lack of emotional reciprocation that he received from his father may have impacted the offending behaviour, given that he had a ""confusion about being close to others"" and how to display love.""

122In due course the report of Ms Hopkins was tendered by the applicant's counsel in the sentence proceedings. 

123The Crown submitted that this Court should have regard to the apparent admissions by the applicant in the event that he succeeded in one of his grounds of appeal with the evidence being relevant to one or other of the following:

(a) The application of the proviso under s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 with the Court concluding that, taking into account the apparent admissions, no substantial miscarriage of justice had actually occurred so that the appeal ought to be dismissed or

(b) In determining to order a new trial under s8 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, rather than direct the acquittal of the applicant under s6(2) of that Act. 

124The Court was taken to a number of decisions where it was said that, after conviction by a jury, an appellant had confessed his guilt (in one way or another) before the hearing of an appeal against conviction: R v De-Cressac [1985] 1 NSWLR 381; R v Reid (NSWCCA 13 September 1993, unreported); R v McCarthy and Ryan (1993) 71 A Crim R 395; R v Gudgeon (1995) 83 A Crim R 228; R v Bikic [2001] NSWCCA 537 and Cesan v The Queen; Mas Rivadavia v The Queen [2008] HCA 52; 236 CLR 358.

125Had the applicant succeeded in any of his Grounds of Appeal, it may have been necessary to determine whether post conviction admissions made before the appeal could be taken into account by this Court in the ways submitted by the Crown. A preliminary difficulty would be determining whether in fact an admission had been made and if the admissions in fact covered all 11 counts. Moreover, the wording of the s6(1) proviso directs attention to the evidence that was before the jury at trial (Cesan at [123] - [129]).

126The following observation in Cesan by Hayne, Crennan and Kiefel JJ (Heydon J agreeing) at [131] would stand in the way of the Crown submission concerning the proviso:

""131 Finally, some weight was given[89] by the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal to a letter written by Mr Cesan to the trial judge after the jury had returned a guilty verdict and before sentence was passed. The majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal considered that, in the letter, he admitted his guilt of the offence charged. The letter was written for the evident purpose of mitigating the sentence that was then to be passed upon Mr Cesan. To do other than accept the jury's verdict would have aggravated the sentence. No weight can be attached to what was said in the letter in deciding whether there was no substantial miscarriage of justice.""

127This issue was referred to in dicta by Johnson J in Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126 at [47] - [64]; 210 A Crim R 326 There his Honour said in relation to a retrial:

""58 If this Court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred following conviction on indictment and the conviction is to be quashed, the Court may order a new trial where, having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial. Section 6(2); s8(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

59 Section 8(1) provides for the Court to have regard to ""all the circumstances"", a phrase of considerable breadth. In the Queen v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at 254 [49, Gummow Hayne and Crennan JJ observed that one of the key ""circumstances"" referred to in s8(1) and one of the key factors in assessing whether a new trial is an adequate remedy, is the public interest in the due prosecution and conviction of offenders. Their Honours, at 255 [51], found in the context of that case that an order for acquittal conflicted with the desirability of having the guilt or innocence of the accused person finally determined by a jury.

60 However, a little later their Honours referred, at 256 [52], to the undesirability of the prosecution having an opportunity to present a new case at a retrial where the evidence had been insufficient at the first trial.""

128I have considerable doubts as to whether an ""admission"" such as occurred in this case could influence the application of the proviso in s6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. It may, however, have become significant if there were a real issue as to whether the appropriate order was one for acquittal or for a retrial. That issue, however, does not arise for decision in this case.

129In relation to the conviction appeal the order which I propose is that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

Sentence Appeal

130The Crown appeals against the sentence imposed on the applicant on 3 August 2012. The individual sentences are set out at [3] hereof. The total effective sentence was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7½ years (15 May 2012 to 14 November 2019) with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 14 November 2022. For ease of reference I have continued to refer to TDP as the applicant.

131The Grounds of Appeal upon which the Crown relies are as follows:

Ground 1 - His Honour breached s45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in not imposing a non-parole period with respect to counts 2, 3, 5 and 7.

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in taking into account the respondent's mental health in the manner that he did.

Ground 3 - His Honour erred by failing to adequately accumulate the sentences consistent with the totality principle leading to a manifestly inadequate total sentence and a manifestly inadequate non-parole period.

Ground 4 - The sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.

132The factual background to the offending is set out at [8] - [30] hereof.

Sentence proceedings

133His Honour held that counts 1 and 4 constituted the worst offences and were ""serious examples of offences of their kind"" (ROS 14.9). In relation to count 4 his Honour said:

""Count 4 particularly involved penile/anal intercourse over a prolonged period of time. There can have been no doubt in the offender's mind that A was not consenting to what was being done to her. She persistently objected, insisting that he stop. What he was doing was excruciatingly painful for her. It was not only humiliating but was over an extended period of time. Thus, I am of the view that this particular offence is a serious example of crimes of its type."" (ROS 14.9 - 15.2)

His Honour held that each of the remaining offences was ""towards the middle of the range"".

134The applicant was in his late thirties at the time of the offending and is now aged 41. He had no prior convictions and was of previous good character. 

135His Honour had regard to the report of a psychologist, Ms Hopkins, dated 16 July 2012. Although the applicant had defended the proceedings on the basis that the offences did not occur, he made admissions to Ms Hopkins to the effect that he had engaged in sexual activity with the complainant.

136The psychologist made the following findings and observations. She thought that the applicant's remorse appeared genuine. She noted that after his arrest he was diagnosed with depression and a psychotic illness by a psychiatrist at the Clarke Centre and that he reported a delusional belief that the complainant was sexually involved with her brother, B. Ms Hopkins thought that he met the criteria for a diagnosis of generalised anxiety disorder and seemed to have symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder, although this could not be diagnosed given the brief nature of the assessment. She assessed there to be a low to moderate risk of the applicant re-offending.

137The conclusion arrived at by his Honour in relation to the applicant's psychiatric condition was:

""I am prepared to accept that he suffers from some psychiatric condition, the precise nature of which is uncertain, given the passage that I have just quoted. I do propose to take that condition into account in his favour in determining the proper sentence to be imposed upon him consistent with the principles identified by the High Court in Muldrock [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (ROS 14.1)

138His Honour was critical of the change of position on the part of the applicant in that he was prepared to admit to the offending in the sentence proceedings, whereas at trial he had put forward a positive case that the offences had not occurred. His Honour said:

""In effect he actively called the victim a liar and obliged her to endure what must have been the excruciating process of giving the evidence of the appalling conduct perpetrated upon her by the accused. This was conduct over about three and a half years and the various counts in the indictment only disclosed part of his predatory sexual assaults on her during that time. I accept the Crown's submission that this act, in now confessing to these crimes, really demonstrates that TDP is prepared to say or do anything to his own advantage. Firstly he pleaded not guilty and denied the charges and accused his victim of being a liar. On his conviction he then announces to the psychologist that he in fact committed these crimes and I am invited to see those admissions as some evidence of his prospects of rehabilitation and as a demonstration of his remorse and contrition for these crimes. ... Nonetheless, the outrageous hypocrisy that his change of story now represents does not stand well for him in the sentencing process."" (ROS 12.2 - .9)

Ground 1 - His Honour breached s45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in not imposing a non-parole period with respect to counts 2, 3, 5 and 7.

139The Crown submitted that each of the offences in counts 2, 3, 5 and 7 carried a standard non-parole period of 10 years but his Honour imposed fixed terms for those counts. The Crown submitted that this was contrary to ss 44 and 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which obliged him to fix a non-parole period for offences which specified a standard non-parole period. The Crown submitted that there was no discretion in complying with this requirement (SGJ v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76] - [78]).

140The Crown submitted that error having occurred in that way, s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should apply and that in the circumstances a greater sentence was warranted in law than that which was imposed by his Honour.

141The applicant accepted that his Honour failed to comply with ss 44 and 45 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and that the applicant would have to be re-sentenced in relation to those counts. He submitted that however the correction was made, the addition of a parole period should maintain the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of term in relation to the total effective sentence to which he was subject.

142The applicant did not accept that s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act applied to an appeal under s5D of the Act. He submitted that the question was not ""whether some greater sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed"" but whether the total effective sentence was manifestly inadequate.

143The applicant's submission should be accepted. Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act does not apply to an appeal by the Crown under s5D. His Honour undoubtedly made an error in failing to set non-parole periods for the offences in counts 2, 3, 5 and 7. In the context of this appeal, these are technical errors and are not determinative of the outcome of the appeal. 

Ground 2 - His Honour erred in taking into account the respondent's mental health in the manner that he did.

144In support of that ground, the Crown relied upon his Honour's conclusion in relation to the psychological evidence as set out at [136] hereof and also on the following observation of his Honour:

""It was put to me that the psychologist's report demonstrates that he suffers from some mental illness. True it is that during the trial there was some evidence that indicated that towards the end of the events, which gave rise to these charges, he was admitted to a psychiatric institution suffering apparently from some form of breakdown. It was suggested that at that time there were paranoid and delusional aspects to his psychological makeup and that may be true. I am not prepared to conclude, one way or the other, as to whether at the time he committed the last of these various crimes he was in fact suffering from a mental illness."" (ROS 13.1)

145On the basis of that material, the Crown submitted that it was unclear what his Honour meant when he said that he was taking the applicant's mental illness into account, consistent with the principles identified in Muldrock. This was particularly so when his Honour declined to find a causal link between his mental illness and the offending. The Crown noted that there was no express finding that the applicant's time in custody would be more onerous because of his mental illness. The Crown submitted that error had been established because of his Honour's lack of precision on this issue. 

146The applicant submitted that the Crown's submissions needlessly complicated what was a straight forward observation by the sentencing judge, i.e., that having found mental illness, he would take that condition into account in accordance with established principle. 

147In a sense both the Crown and the applicant are correct in their submissions. I agree with the Crown that his Honour's rolled up reference to taking into account the applicant's mental illness in a way consistent with the principles set out in Muldrock is too Delphic to elucidate how his Honour proposed to take that factor into account. On the other hand, there is no indication, either by reference to the sentences imposed or otherwise, that his Honour failed to properly take that factor into account.

148It is accepted that even if an offender's mental illness has no causal relationship to the offending, it can still be relevant to the extent to which general deterrence and specific deterrence are taken into account. In this case, it is clear from his Honour's finding that the applicant's mental illness would not reduce his moral culpability. It also seems from the specific facts of this case and from the very general nature of the symptoms exhibited by the applicant, that his mental illness would have little effect upon general deterrence and specific deterrence. On the other hand, his mental illness may well mean that his sentence will weigh more heavily upon him than it would on a person of normal health and that the imprisonment may have an adverse effect on his mental health.

149Clearly, the applicant's mental health was a factor which could and should have been taken into account by his Honour and apart from the rather opaque reference by his Honour as to how he proposed to take it into account, I am not persuaded that his Honour otherwise erred in dealing with the applicant's mental health. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 3 - His Honour erred by failing to adequately accumulate the sentences consistent with the totality principle leading to a manifestly inadequate total sentence and a manifestly inadequate non-parole period.

Ground 4 - The sentence pronounced was manifestly inadequate.

150The Crown did not challenge the individual sentences. What the Crown challenged was the extent of concurrency and what it said was the inadequate accumulation of the sentences. In that regard, the Crown noted that the sentences in respect of counts 1 - 5 were fully concurrent, as were those in respect of counts 6 - 11. That was so despite the fact that the offending in counts 1 - 5 covered a period of almost 2 years and those in counts 6 - 11 occurred over a period of 5 months between August and December 2010, approximately 15 months after the offences in counts 1 - 5. The Crown noted that the offences in counts 1 - 11 occurred against a background of offending extending over 3½ years. 

151The particular challenges made by the Crown were in respect of counts 1 and 4, which were fully concurrent even though his Honour identified them as the two most serious offences. The Crown was also critical of the modest accumulation of 18 months between counts 1 - 5 and 6 - 11. The Crown submitted that nowhere in his remarks on sentence did his Honour take into account the aggravating feature that during the whole period the complainant was under the applicant's authority. The Crown submitted that in relation to each offence, the breach of trust was extreme. This was not only because the respondent was in loco parentis, but because the offences generally occurred when the complainant was isolated from any source of assistance. The Crown noted that the complainant's silence was achieved by threats.

152The Crown's general submission was that his Honour failed to observe the fundamental principle when sentencing for multiple offences which was to ensure that the overall sentence reflected the totality of the criminality evidenced by the offences. The Crown submitted that in order to meet that requirement, it was necessary for there to be some accumulation between the offences in count 1 and count 4 and a more substantial accumulation between the two groups of offences, i.e., counts 1 - 5 and counts 6 - 11. This was particularly so when the offending took place over a long period of time.

153The Crown relied upon Regina v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115; 195 A Crim R 38 where Hall J (with whom Tobias JA and Kirby J agreed) set out a number of propositions from Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 and Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14 which needed to be observed when sentencing for multiple offences:

""52 There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively: see Cahyadi v Regina (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at 47. However, a number of propositions relevant to the consideration of that issue may be derived from the case law. They include the following:- 

(1) It is well established that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. What is important is that, firstly, an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence; and, secondly, that the total sentence imposed properly reflects the totality of the criminality: Regina v Wilson [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38] per Simpson J, Barr and Latham JJ agreeing.

(2) In Regina v Weldon; Regina v Carberry (2002) 136 A Crim R 55, Ipp JA at [48] stated that it is ""not infrequent that, where the offences arise out of one criminal enterprise, concurrent sentences will be imposed"" but his Honour observed that ""this is not an inflexible rule"" and ""[t]he practice should not be followed where wholly concurrent sentences would fail to take account of differences in conduct"".

(3) The question as to whether sentences in respect of two or more offences committed in the course of a single episode or a criminal enterprise or on a particular day should be concurrent or at least partly accumulated is to be determined by the principle of totality and the relevant factors to be taken into account in the application of that principle. See observations in this respect of Howie J in Nguyen v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 14 at [12].

(4) In applying the principle of totality, the question to be posed is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other offence. See generally Regina v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 at [11] and [13], Cahyadi (supra) at [12] and [27] and Vaovasa v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 253.

(5) If the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentences ought to be concurrent, otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the totality of the two offences: Cayhadi (supra) per Howie J at [27].

(6) If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality: Cayhadi (supra) per Howie J at [27].

(7) Whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other calls for the identification and an evaluation of relevant factors pertaining to the offences. These will include the nature and seriousness of each offence.

(8) In cases involving assault with violence where the offences involve two or more attacks of considerable violence and are distinct and separate (eg, see Regina v Dunn [2004] NSWCCA 41 at [50]) or in cases where there are separate victims of the attacks as in Wilson (supra), the closeness in time and proximity of the two offences will often not be determinative factors. See also Regina v KM [2004] NSWCCA 65. In Wilson (supra), having regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, Simpson J observed at [38] that ""... to fail to accumulate, at least partially, may well be seen as a failure to acknowledge the harm done to those individual victims ...""

...

(9) Where two offences committed during the course of a single episode are of a completely different nature and each individually involved significant or extreme gravity, it is likely that some accumulation will be necessary to address the criminality of the two: Nguyen (supra) per Howie J at [13].

(10) Possession of two different kinds of drugs may not be regarded as one episode of criminality in a case of ""deemed"" supply: Luu v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 285 at [32].

(11) The fact that the evidence of two offences (eg, documentary evidence or the presence of drugs) are located by police at or in the one place is not a relevant factor in favour of concurrent sentences:-

""... The fact that the evidence of a number of discrete offences is located in the one place is completely irrelevant to any question of how the sentences for those offences should be imposed."" (Cahaydi (supra) at [26]).""

154The Crown submitted that by reference to those considerations, it was clear that his Honour erred in failing to accumulate the sentences imposed for the offences in counts 1 and 4 and by not providing for greater accumulation between the two groups of offences in counts 1 - 5 and 6 - 11.

155The applicant relied upon the oft stated principle in Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 231 at 329 [22] where Gaudron and Gummow JJ said:

""22 In the circumstances of the present case, the question for the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the result reached by the trial judge had been ""upon the facts ... unreasonable or plainly unjust [so that] the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance"". Was the sentence ""manifestly wrong""?""

156The applicant also relied upon the reaffirmation by the majority in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 (French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ) of the restraint to be observed by courts in Crown appeals. The majority said:

""1 The primary purpose of appeals against sentence by the Attorney-General or Director of Public Prosecutions (""Crown appeals"") under s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) (""the Criminal Appeal Act"") is ""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons."" That purpose distinguishes Crown appeals from appeals against severity of sentence by convicted persons, which are concerned with the correction of judicial error in particular cases. The Court of Criminal Appeal of New South Wales, in the exercise of its jurisdiction under s5D, has a discretion to decline to interfere with a sentence even though the sentence is erroneously lenient. That discretion is sometimes called the ""residual discretion"".

...

24 Section 5D was enacted in its original form in 1924. Crown appeals under s 5D and like provisions in other States and Territories have long been regarded by this Court as exceptional. That exceptional character, reflected in the primary purpose of such appeals, informs the exercise of the Court's ""residual discretion"" embedded in the words ""may in its discretion"" in s 5D(1). That ""residual discretion"" is a discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal notwithstanding that the sentence appealed against is shown to be erroneously lenient. ...

25 ... The characterisation of Crown appeals as ""exceptional"" has rested in part upon long-standing judicial concern about exposing sentenced persons to double jeopardy, that is, the risk of being re-sentenced. In New South Wales that concern must now yield to the operation of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. ... 

26 Section 68A provides that an appeal court must not dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again. It applies to appeals commenced, but not fully determined, before it was inserted in the Act. ... It is not necessary for this Court to review the correctness of the construction of s 68A in JW. On any view of its operation it does not extinguish the residual discretion. ..."" 

157The applicant submitted that even if this Court were of the opinion that there was some error in the sentences imposed, particularly in relation to accumulation, it should have regard to those principles and not intervene to increase the sentence.

158Even having regard to the observations of the majority in Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen, absent other considerations, I am of the opinion that his Honour did err in failing to allow some accumulation between the sentence imposed for the offence in count 1 and that imposed for the offence in count 4. To make those sentences fully concurrent, as his Honour did, does not adequately reflect the criminality of those two offences.

159Although the level of accumulation between the offences in counts 1 - 5 and those in counts 6 - 11 is modest, it is not erroneously so, such as to require the intervention of this Court in a Crown appeal.

160There are, however, other considerations which need to be taken into account. There was a delay of approximately 10 weeks between the sentences being passed on the applicant and the Crown providing notification of its intention to appeal. That delay remains unexplained. 

161There is another more significant consideration. Although there was some dispute as to the meaning to be given to certain exchanges between the Crown and his Honour in the sentence proceedings, it is clear that the Crown submitted that his Honour should structure the sentences in the way in which he did, i.e., that the offences in counts 1 - 5 should be grouped together, as should those in counts 6 - 11 and that there should be an accumulation between the two groups. It was implicit in that submission that there should not be accumulation between offences within those groups.

162In Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 302 Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ said:

""9 In these circumstances, the following comments of King CJ (with whom Mitchell and Williams JJ agreed) in Regina v Wilton (1981) 28 SASR at 367-368 which have been cited with approval in this and other courts were applicable to the application for, and weighed heavily against the grant of, leave to appeal to the Crown in the present cases:


"" It is necessary to consider whether the prosecution
should be allowed to raise on the appeal the contention that the sentence ought not to have been suspended when that contention was not put in the Court below. ... In my opinion, this Court should allow the prosecution to put to it, on an appeal against sentence, contentions which were not put to the sentencing Judge, only in exceptional circumstances which appear to justify that course. I endorse with respect what was said in Tait and Bartley as to the duty of prosecuting counsel before the sentencing judge. In particular where a submission is made by counsel for a convicted person that a sentence should be suspended or a possible suspension is mentioned by the judge, and this course is regarded by the prosecution as beyond the proper scope of the judge's discretion, a submission to that effect should be made. Generally speaking, if the submission is not made to the sentencing judge the prosecution should not be able to advance that contention successfully on an appeal by the Attorney-General.""""

163It follows in the particular circumstances of this case that the Crown should not be allowed to challenge the approach which the sentencing judge followed in relation to accumulation when that approach was specifically recommended and endorsed by the Crown in the sentence proceedings.

164It is necessary to adjust the sentences for counts 2, 3, 5 and 7 because of the error identified in Ground 1. Otherwise I would dismiss the Crown appeal.

165The orders which I propose are as follows:

(1) In respect of the appeal against conviction, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

(2) With respect to the Crown appeal against sentence, the orders which I propose are:

(a) The sentences in respect of counts 2, 3, 5 and 7 are quashed and in lieu thereof, the applicant is sentenced as follows:

Count 2 - A term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing 15 May 2012 and expiring 14 May 2015, with a balance of term of 18 months expiring 14 November 2016.

Count 3 - A term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 15 May 2012 and expiring 14 May 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 14 May 2018.

Count 5 - A term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 15 May 2012 and expiring 14 May 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring 14 May 2018.

Count 7 - A term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to date from 15 November 2015 and to expire on 14 May 2018, with a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months expiring 14 November 2019.

(b) The Crown appeal against sentence is otherwise dismissed.

166BLANCH J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

167R A HULME J: I agree with the reasons and conclusions of Hoeben CJ at CL in respect of the appeal against conviction.

168I have considerable disquiet about whether a total effective sentence of 10 years 6 months is adequate to reflect the gross level of offending by the applicant against his step-daughter over a prolonged period of time. In my view, there should have been further accumulation of at least some of the individual sentences so as to achieve a total term which better reflected the totality of the applicant's criminality. 

169But as Hoeben CJ at CL has pointed out, the learned sentencing judge applied the principle of totality by accumulating the sentences in precisely the manner suggested by the Crown. The degree of accumulation, namely 3 years, of one group of sentences upon the other group is not insignificant. I agree that the challenge now made by the Crown to his Honour's approach should be rejected. I also agree that, subject to the problem identified under Ground 1, the Crown appeal should be dismissed.

170In sentencing for counts 2, 3, 5 and 7, the judge purported to exercise the discretion to ""decline to set a non-parole period"" provided in s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). He failed to heed the requirement in s 45(2) to provide reasons for doing so. And, of course, he failed to note that the discretion provided in s 45(1) is not available in respect of offences for which there is prescribed a standard non-parole period.

171I have observed elsewhere that a failure to provide reasons for imposing a fixed term sentence leaves this Court to speculate as to whether the judge intended the fixed term to represent the overall term of the sentence or only the non-parole component the judge had in mind: Collier v R [2012] NSWCCA 213 at [55]. I also observed (at [58]) that there appears to be a real question as to whether s 45 provides a discretion for a judge to reduce a sentence from what would otherwise have been imposed; the section read literally provides a discretion to decline to set a non-parole period, not to imposed only a non-parole period.

172This Court has not adopted a uniform approach when remedying this type of error. Sometimes it has increased the sentence by adding a parole period while on other occasions it has left the sentence intact but set a non-parole within it: examples were cited in Collier at [59]-[61]. Further examples of the Court taking the latter approach can be found in the subsequent cases of Reeves v R; R v Reeves [2013] NSWCCA 34 at [278] per Hall J and Lipchin v R [2013] NSWCCA 77 at [20] per Hidden J. 

173The orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL adopt the former approach of increasing the sentences by adding a parole period. What is proposed has no effect upon the overall sentence and the minimum custodial component of it. In my view, giving effect to the intention of the sentencing judge is a paramount consideration. By comparing the level of seriousness of the offences as his Honour assessed them, and then comparing the periods of the fixed term sentences imposed, it seems more likely that he set those terms at what would otherwise have been the non-parole periods.

174I agree with the orders proposed by Hoeben CJ at CL.

2705751,Jansen v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 301,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  I agree, for the reasons given by Campbell J, that the applicant should have leave to appeal against his sentence, but that the appeal should be dismissed.
2PRICE J: I agree with Campbell J.
3CAMPBELL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal from the sentence passed on him in the District Court of New South Wales on Friday 5th June 2012 by his Honour Judge Sides QC. The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of misconduct in public office as a member of the New South Wales Police Force.  At the applicant's request, six further offences were taken into account on a Form 1 under s.33 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (Sentencing Act). Moreover, there were six related offences on a Certificate under s166 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) transferred to the District Court.
4For the principal offence, taking into account the six matters on the Form 1, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of two years and an additional term of two and a half years. The sentence was backdated to 13th June 2012 to reflect two days spent in custody after the applicant's arrest. The applicant is first eligible for parole on 12th June 2014. In respect of the six s166 matters, the sentencing judge recorded a conviction without further penalty under s10A Sentencing Act, because the criminality of these matters overlapped with the matters taken into account in the Form 1.
5The applicant advances three grounds of appeal as follows:
(1)The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the marked disparity between his sentence and the sentence imposed upon the co-offender, Martin Sheta.  
(2)The sentencing judge erred in failing to consider the maximum penalties for relevant statutory offences as a reference point or guide to the imposition of sentence.
(3)The sentence was manifestly excessive.
I will refer to the co-offender as Sheta.
Factual background
6The offending the subject of the misconduct in public office charge involved a course of conduct over a period commencing at 3pm on 22nd February 2011, and ending at 4pm on 9th March 2011, when the applicant was arrested.  
7There are number of different facets to the offending, the most significant of which related to the applicant accessing police intelligence and other sensitive information from police databases.  
8The applicant undertook this unauthorised access at the request of Sheta, who passed the documents which the applicant had printed to a third party, named Toma, who further disseminated the information.
9The misconduct in public office offending covered a course of conduct having nine aspects: three incidents of accessing, printing out, and disseminating highly confidential and sensitive criminal intelligence histories; and six incidents of falsifying computerised timesheets to cover unauthorised absences from his post to attend to matters outside his duty. These six incidents relate to absences on five days. For each of the six absences, he claimed to have been in the field carrying out surveillance. Instead he was engaged as follows:
(a)22nd February 2011 - absent for 2 hours and 30 minutes attending the gym;
(b)24th February - absent to inspect a motorcycle he was considering buying. He then went home without completing his shift;
(c)1st March 2011 - absented himself for 7 hours and 30 minutes at home and the gym. This date also relates to the unauthorised dissemination of information;
(d)2nd March 2011 - absented himself for nearly 5 hours to attend home, the gym and to attend to other leisure activities;
(e)4th March 2011 - absented himself for over 3 hours to attend the gym. This date also relates to the unauthorised dissemination of information. Some time after his return to the police station he departed again for dinner with friends and did not return to duty before the expiration of his shift at 10pm. He falsified his timesheet to cover his movements in respect of the second absence on this day on 9th March 2011, the date also associated with the unauthorised dissemination of information, and the date of his arrest.
10For the purpose of assessing the objective seriousness of the applicant's offending, the sentencing judge concentrated upon the aspect of the unauthorised dissemination of information. It needs to be borne in mind in respect of this facet of the offending that it involved a course of misconduct extending beyond the mere provision of information. Sheta was an acquaintance from the applicant's gym. That person solicited the provision of information at the behest of Toma. The course of misconduct involved the applicant disclosing the nature of his work with the police, permitting Sheta to solicit information relating to named individuals, accessing police data at his behest, printing out relevant documents meeting the request, and providing those print-outs to Sheta. Of course, once the print-outs were handed over the applicant had no control over their further use (or, rather, misuse).
11There is no suggestion that money changed hands for the provision of the information. But as the sentencing judge pointed out, financial gain is not an element of the offence, even if it may frequently be an incident of it. Where it is, that matter may be an aggravating circumstance. In any event it is notorious that doing a friend a favour may be a most insidious form of corruption.
12As some of the information was police intelligence, the provision of the information sought necessarily provided a broad narrative in which a number of offenders, persons of interest and police officers were named, sources identified and the state of police corporate knowledge and belief disclosed.
13On 1st March 2011, the offender provided 189 pages of information to Sheta by leaving it on the passenger seat of the latter's ute. Toma removed the material from the ute using keys he had obtained from Sheta.
14On 4th March 2011, Sheta provided a name on a slip of paper. The sentencing judge referred to the person named as ""an organised crime figure"". The applicant accessed the police computer and printed out police intelligence information about this person. After first obtaining the keys from Sheta to his ute, the offender left the material in the vehicle, returning the key to Sheta. Sheta later handed these documents to Toma.  
15On 6th March 2011, Sheta reminded the applicant that he had not provided all the information previously requested about persons named on the list previously provided. On 9th March, the applicant printed out five ICOPS reports from the computer at the intelligence office at the Parramatta Police Station. Sheta later picked the documents up from the applicant at his home. Again, some documents were handed over to Toma.
16All three offenders were arrested on that day.
17The additional offences on the Form 1 consisted of forging five medical certificates to be used to cover absences from work and an offence relating to yet another unauthorised absence. The additional criminality involved was required to be taken into account in sentencing for the principal offence. 
The offender's subjective circumstances
18The sentencing judge rejected the offender's case that he had co-operated with Sheta only because of duress (s21A(3)(d) Sentencing Act). This part of the decision is not challenged on appeal.
19The applicant was born on 23rd May 1985 and was 27 years old at the time he was sentenced. He is second in a sibship of four. After his parents separated when he was seven, he was raised solely by his mother and continued to live in her home until he was sentenced. It was necessary for his mother to work to raise her family and his elder sister took on a supervisory role in relation to her younger siblings. The trial judge accepted evidence that when he lived with the family, the applicant's father was a violent alcoholic. His Honour found that the offender had the disadvantage of a dysfunctional upbringing. However, he completed school, being a prefect in his final year, and involved himself in sports when young.
20He had a good employment record working part time while still at school and in a variety of jobs after leaving, before joining the army, where he did not fit in and left after only eighteen days. He then joined the police force, despite his mother advising him against it. The sentencing judge found that he was ""not a person with a personality suited to the role of a police officer either"" (ROS page 7). As he was unsuitable he had difficulty in this service, including in his interactions with other officers. He sought changes in his role in an attempt to continue with the police, ultimately working in intelligence, rather than directly in the field on general duties.
21When he resigned on 29th September 2011 - after his arrest - the applicant was successful in finding work in Local Government in a labouring capacity. He appears to have been well thought of by his new employer and obtained promotion to work as ""a safety advocate"".
22There is no evidence of substance abuse or financial problems. As I have already pointed out, money was not a motivating factor in the offending.  
23The sentencing judge said he was extending to the applicant the benefit of his prior good character, but observed that as good character was an essential attribute of a police officer it had provided the offender with the opportunity to offend. The sentencing judge referred to significant stressful events in the applicant's life and found on the evidence that the offender suffered from a constellation of depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms. His Honour accepted that aspects of the applicant's personality made policing an unsuitable vocation for him. However, the sentencing judge found that neither his personality difficulties nor his mental health issues in this case reduced the moral culpability of his offending.
24The sentencing judge accepted, however, that concerns about his mother's health, his own personality type, and his prior service as a police officer would render the offender vulnerable in jail, and his first time in custody, by reason of these matters, would be more burdensome than otherwise.  
25His Honour accepted that the applicant's prospects of rehabilitation, and not re-offending, ""are very good"". He allowed the applicant a 25% discount for his early plea of guilty.
Reasons for sentence
26The sentencing judge was clearly aware that the applicant's ""criminality"" in relation to the offence was not limited to the release of confidential information on three occasions, but extended to the other acts including those involving him creating a false record of his activities to mask him absenting himself from duty. Of the former, his Honour found that whilst the offender was not the instigator, the misconduct was clearly premeditated, involving the offender knowingly ""enmeshing himself in organised criminal activity... putting the safety of others at risk"" (ROS 16). The sentencing judge said:
Inherent in an offence like this is a breach of trust. He released a relatively large volume of sensitive police intelligence. The risk to public safety was significant. There is evidence that the safety of members of the public as well as [of] one police officer and her family were jeopardised. Activity like this has the potential to compromise police investigations and prosecutions and disclosing police methods to the criminal milieu.
His offending involved more than one act. He had no control over the documents once they were handed over to his co-offender Sheta. They could be copied many times over. The form in which they appeared would give them authenticity. This type of offending is much more serious than a case where somebody provides information from a computer database over the telephone or orally. As the Court understands it, only the material he handed over to his co-offender on 9 March has been recovered by the police.
...
Offences like this have a real potential to undermine public confidence in the police's ability to maintain confidentiality in relation to information supplied by members of the public. The flow-on of such lack of confidence will be a reduction in the flow of information to the Police Force from the public. In the Court's view this is a very serious example of an offence of this type.
Although the Offender said he was remorseful, he made concerted efforts to minimise his criminality by claiming he acted under duress. In the circumstances the Court is not persuaded that this is a case where the Offender is genuinely remorseful.
27His Honour referred to, but as I read his reasons, did not make a discount on the sentence for, the applicant's rejected offers of assistance, as his Honour decided, for the cogent reasons he gave, they were not of any great value.
28On the important issue of parity of sentencing, his Honour noted that as Sheta had then yet to be dealt with for the charges against him ""no issue of parity arises"" (ROS 18). Toma had received a small fine and a bond under s.9 of the Sentencing Act of two years. The finding that ""no issue of parity arises"" in respect of Toma is not challenged on appeal.
29His Honour made passing reference to other cases to which he had been referred by the Crown, which he did not name, but which he understood as indicating that the notional maximum penalty for the common law offence of misconduct in public office in Victoria was imprisonment for ten years. He did not find the cases sufficiently like the instant case to be of assistance. His own researches uncovered R v Jaturawong [2011] NSWCCA 168. Again, his Honour did not find that case helpful because it is very different factually.
30The sentencing judge decided that no sentence other than ""a significant sentence of imprisonment was called for"" (ROS 19), but found the absence of a prior custodial sentence constituted special circumstances.
The sentence passed on Martin Sheta
31For the purpose of determining the parity ground of appeal, it is necessary to consider the sentence passed on Sheta by his Honour Judge Nicholson QC on 23rd August 2012, after the applicant had been sentenced.
32Sheta was charged with three counts of making a collusive agreement with a member of the New South Wales Police Force for the purpose of inducing him to neglect his duty by supplying confidential information, contrary to s.200 Police Act 1990 (NSW). These three charges were the counter point of the three incidents of the applicant's unauthorised dissemination of confidential information forming part of the conduct giving rise to the single charge of misconduct in public office.  
33Sheta pleaded not guilty, and at his trial on 3rd June 2011 the jury acquitted him of the charge relating to 1st March, but convicted him of the charges relating to the unauthorised dissemination of information by the applicant on the 4th and 9th of March 2011. It will be recalled that the alleged offence of 1st March 2011 related to the supply by the offender to Sheta of 189 pages of police intelligence information.
34For the first of the offences of which he had been convicted, Sheta was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, having a non-parole period of 6 months and an additional term of 6 months. For the second he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 months, and an additional term of 12 months. Each sentence was to be served concurrently.
35In assessing the objective criminality of Sheta's offending, Judge Nicholson referred to the sentencing judge's observations concerning the potential of offending of this type to undermine public confidence in the police and the performance of their important work. Judge Nicholson also found that the relevant criminal conduct sought to undermine the capacity of the police to do their job and involved corruption of a serving member of the police force even if money had not changed hands. It constituted an attack upon ""a proper administration of criminal justice"". His Honour also bore in mind that the evidence before him did not enable him to adjudge how widely the information had been disseminated or the extent to which it might compromise the willingness of informants or members of the community to further assist police. His Honour did find that the offending involved ""a monumental invasion of privacy"" of persons named in the material, being those under suspicion, and those who provided information, alike.  
36His Honour took a different view of the significance of the allegation of threats made against the police inspector named in the documents who had received information from varying sources about a person under suspicion. Judge Nicholson did not rate this consideration as seriously as Judge Sides. He accepted the genuineness of the Police Inspector's concern but ""given the absolute rule against the admissibility of second hand hearsay"" he was not prepared to find as a fact that the threats actually had been made. He did accept that the Police Inspector made changes to her daily life given the genuineness of her belief.  
37He found that Sheta was a facilitator as well as a conduit. The gravamen of his offending was to induce the applicant to abuse his public trust, which his Honour regarded as ""really an element of the offence"". Judge Nicholson found that Sheta was aware that his conduct was illegal.
38Turning to Sheta's subjective circumstances, the Judge found that he was born in 1981 and was therefore 29 years of age at the time of the offending and 30 at the time he was sentenced. He was born in Iraq but left that troubled country at the age of twelve, eventually arriving in Australia when he was fourteen with his family, who were, and remained, in difficult financial circumstances.
39Sheta received very little schooling, either in his native Iraq or here. The Judge rejected his claims of being ""functionally illiterate"", proceeding on the basis that the Jury accepted sufficient reading skills to send SMS messages, hold a drivers license and read traffic signals.
40Sheta had a poor industrial record and no work skills. Judge Nicholson found that Sheta was not contrite. His Honour said ""there was nothing in the evidence before me to suggest he would not do the same thing again if asked to do so by  [Toma]"". There have been previous offences for property damage, assault and affray. And the Judge felt unable to make a positive finding in relation to prospects of rehabilitation.
41Judge Nicholson took the view that ""parity [was] not required"". So far as can be told, this is because his Honour was of the view that ""the offence calendar to which [the applicant] pleaded guilty is substantially different to the charges before this Court"". His Honour noticed the more extensive misconduct constituting the applicant's offending, and Sheta's acquittal of the first count.
Ground 1 - parity
42Mr PJD Hamill SC, who appeared for the applicant, argued that notwithstanding the differences between them, for the purpose of the parity principle, the applicant and Sheta were co-offenders and the former should be taken to be entitled to the requisite, objectively determined and justifiable sense of grievance arising from the disparity in the sentences passed upon them. If anything, given Sheta initiated the criminal conduct and the applicant's more favourable subjective case, one might have expected the latter would be favoured by the less severe sentence. In these circumstances, the differences were ""extraordinary"".
43The Crown accepted correctly that the parity principle could apply in cases where co-offenders were not charged with or convicted of the same offence. The Crown reminded the Court of the difficulties that can arise ""in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise, who had been charged with different crimes"", especially ""where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of [the applicant]"": Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; 244 CLR 462 at [30].  The Crown acknowledged that practical difficulties and limitations ""do not exclude the operation of the parity principle"". Rather, the Crown emphasised the following aspects of the case demonstrating relevant differences in their offending:
(i)The serious breach of trust by a serving police officer;
(ii)The differences in the content of the offending, including the consideration that Sheta had been acquitted of the unauthorised dissemination of information on the 1st of March 2009, involving the supply of five profiles of allegedly serious offenders, totalling 189 pages; and
(iii)The false completion of timesheets, which, the sentencing judge found, had the potential to adversely affect investigations and prosecutions; and
(iv)The matters on the Form 1 related to the forging of medical certificates to justify unauthorised absences from duty, which had to be taken into account in dealing with the offender for the principal offence.
44In my judgment, the Crown arguments are to be preferred. At the same time I acknowledge that the parity principle is founded upon something fundamental i.e. the principle of equal justice according to law, ""an aspect of the rule of law"" itself (Green at [28]). But as French CJ, Crennan and Kiefel JJ observed, that fundamental principle not only expects:
...so far as the law permits, that like cases be treated alike.  
But also,
Equal justice according to law ... requires, where the law permits, differential treatment of persons according to differences between them relevant to the scope, purpose and subject matter of the law.
45Notwithstanding the force of Mr. Hamill's argument about the applicant's superior subjective case, the Crown correctly points out that the nature and extent of the applicant's misconduct constituting his offence justified a stern sentence. This relates to the essential role the police play in our society in investigating crime and enforcing the law. Abuse of that office, as Judge Sides, with respect, fully appreciated, has the potential to endanger public safety, undermine public confidence in the police, and ultimately interfere with the administration of justice.
46As the plurality in Green also said, at [31]:
The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise [emphasis added].
47The matters referred to by the Crown, to my mind, are relevant differences in this context which can be characterised as differences in the part played by each in the relevant criminal conduct, including the extent of the conduct comprising their offending. Clearly, there is a significant difference between the sentences passed. I do not regard the difference as constituting ""marked and unjustified disparity"" (Green at [33]). It could well be said that Sheta was treated leniently. But the difference in the nature, quality and extent of the applicant's offending fully justify the sentence passed on him. I am not of the view that parity, or proportionality, between sentences passed on offenders engaged in a hierarchy of criminal conduct, obliges the Court to reduce the applicant's sentence to a level which would be otherwise inadequate, or at all. I would reject Ground 1.
Ground 2
48The gravamen of Mr. Hamill's argument in relation to the second ground is that although the learned sentencing judge referred to Jaturawong v R, his Honour failed to have regard to available statutory analogues as providing a reference point for the imposition of penalty (see Jaturawong at [5]).  Learned senior counsel referred to eight statutory offences, which he submitted provide relevant analogies. To the extent to which these legislative provisions fixed a maximum penalty of imprisonment, they ranged between three and ten years. Senior counsel pointed out that the offence with which Sheta had been charged carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for seven years. It was submitted that given the 25 per cent discount for the applicant's plea of guilty, his Honour's starting point must have been about six years, very close to the analogous maximum of seven years. It was argued that the present offending could not be regarded as being that close to the worst possible category of misconduct in public office.
49The Crown emphasised that any applicable statutory analogue is simply a reference point. The Crown pointed out ""there is no limit on the power of imprisonment which can be imposed on a person convicted of a common law offence"" (Crown submissions page 5 [17]). The Crown also emphasised that ""the current offence was an overarching offence"" covering a range of misconduct over a period of time. On this basis it would be wrong to confine a court's sentencing discretion to the maximum penalty for a single incident of offending provided for by statute for an offence similar to part only of the subject offending. The sentencing judge's failure to refer to any statutory analogue did not fall into ""error of the kind identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499"".
50In Blackstock v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 172, a sentence appeal involving misconduct in public office consisting of the receipt of large secret commissions over a number of years, I said (with the agreement of Macfarlan JA and Barr AJ) referring to R v Hokin, Burton and Peisley (1922) 22 SR (NSW) 280 at 292 (at [10] - [11]):
[10] I do not understand R v Hokin to establish a rule that the sentence imposed for the common law offence cannot, as a matter of law, exceed the maximum imposed for the statutory analogue.  In delivering the judgment of the Court, Gordon J said at 291-2:
It was contended that on a conviction for a common law misdemeanour the Court could not impose a sentence as in this case of five years and four years imprisonment. In my opinion that contention is untenable. In R. v. White (13 S.C.R. p. 338) ... it was stated by Faucett J, expressing the view of all the members of the Court, that there was no limit in law to the term of imprisonment which might be imposed on a person convicted of a common law misdemeanour. As a rule undoubtedly the practice of the Court (where the misdemeanour charged is an ""attempt"" to commit a statutory offence) is not to impose a greater punishment than that imposed by Statute for the complete offence. .... Here, no doubt, in one sense the offence charged as a common law misdemeanour was a conspiracy to commit perjury and by so doing to defeat justice. The penalty provided by statute for perjury is by s. 327 of the Crimes Act a maximum of seven years penal servitude or a maximum of two years imprisonment with hard labour. An increased penalty is provided by s. 328 which does not apply to this case. In my opinion there is in law no such limit as that contended for on the term of imprisonment which the Court can impose on a person convicted on indictment of a common law misdemeanour.   If this had been a case of a person convicted of an attempt to commit an offence for which the punishment is prescribed by Statute, I should have been prepared to hold that the Court ought not to impose a heavier punishment than that prescribed by Statute for the completed offence. In this case, however, I do not think that rule applies. Here the accused were convicted of a conspiracy to defeat the ends of justice by committing perjury and incidentally branding as a common prostitute a girl who was in fact not such an abandoned character.  ... This is, I think, a matter of discretion to be used in each case according to its circumstances. The presiding Judge sentenced Hokin, the principal offender, to a term of imprisonment for five years, and each of the other two appellants to a term of imprisonment for four years.  While in no way suggesting that such sentence was illegal, I think that in view of the youth of the accused and in view of the maximum term of imprisonment imposed by law for perjury the sentence ought to be reduced in the case of Hokin to three years imprisonment, and in the case of Burton and Peisley to two years imprisonment in each case with hard labour, such sentences to commence as from the date of conviction [emphasis in the original]. 
[11] I have set out this whole passage because, in my view, a consideration of it demonstrates that the statutory analogue provides no more than a reference point which does not fetter the discretion, which remains at large.  The result and the reasoning in R. v. Hokin illustrate this. This will have relevance to the disposition of this case.  Although the Court found the sentences imposed excessive, on re-sentencing the offenders the Court took into account the maximum term of imprisonment imposed by the statutory analogue, but sentenced the main offender to a term of imprisonment which exceeded the statutory maximum by 50 per cent.  In the case of each of the two lesser offenders, terms of imprisonment equal to the statutory maximum were imposed. It is also worth observing that the Court approved the statement in White that ""there was no limit in law to the term of imprisonment which might be imposed on the person convicted of a common law misdemeanour"" (emphasis added). 
51The position established by R v Hokin, Burton and Peisley at 292 therefore is that as a matter of discretion, one may have regard to ""the maximum term of imprisonment imposed by law"" for an analogous statutory offence. But the court's power is not limited by any available statutory analogue. This is evidently why Beazley JA in Jaturawong at [6]-[7] used the phrase ""a reference point"".
52It is true that the learned sentencing judge did not refer to the reasoning in Jaturawong, which decision his own researches uncovered, for this purpose. Doubtless that is because neither Crown nor defence counsel (who did not appear on appeal) referred him to the passage. Neither was he referred to any statutory provisions said to be relevant. In these circumstances, and as there is no clear analogy to stand as a reference point adequately covering the whole course of the misconduct in which the applicant engaged, I am not satisfied that Judge Sides fell into error in this regard. I would reject the second ground of appeal.
Ground 3
53Learned senior counsel argued that the sentence passed on the offender was manifestly excessive. Three ""particulars"" were provided to support this argument. First, the applicant was suffering from a depressive illness and post-traumatic stress at the time of the offence. Secondly, the seven year maximum for offences under s.200 of the Police Act. And thirdly, as it is the offender's first time in custody, his imprisonment would be more onerous compared with the experience of the average inmate. Reference was also made to what were said to be two comparable cases: R v Hughes (unreported) District Court of NSW, 28th March 2013; and R v Farrell (unreported) District Court of NSW, 13th February 2013.
54The Crown argued that to make good this ground, the offender had to positively show that the sentence passed was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25]. It was not sufficient for the Court of Criminal Appeal to substitute its own opinion for that of the sentencing judge because of a mere difference of opinion: Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29; 195 CLR 665 at [15].  
55The Crown emphasised the objective seriousness of the offending as determined by the sentencing judge, the considerations set out at [24] above, and the significance of general deterrence and denunciation in cases of misconduct in public office. The Court was also reminded that consistency of approach does not demand numerical equivalence: Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [59] - [60].
56In approaching this question, I will bear in mind the settled principles which I summarised in Thompson-Davis v R [2013] NSWCCA 75 at [53]. 
57The defendant's argument is undermined somewhat in that what I identify as the second particular is a repetition of Ground 2, which I would reject. Particular 3 was acknowledged by the sentencing judge and indeed formed the basis of the finding of special circumstances which worked in favour of the offender by altering the statutory ratio so as to reduce the minimum time the applicant must serve in prison for his offending.
58As I have stated above, the trial judge was cognisant of the offender's mental condition, accepting the evidence of Dr Allnut at least to that extent. It is true that his Honour found that in the circumstances of the present case, the medical condition (if his symptoms justified that description) actually suffered by the applicant did not serve to reduce his moral culpability. Such a finding was open as it was not shown that mental symptoms of the nature and degree suffered by the offender affected his decision-making capacity in such a manner as to diminish ""the importance of key elements of the sentencing exercise"" such as moral culpability and general deterrence: R v Windle [2012] NSWCCA 222 at [41] per Basten JA. A consideration of these three matters relied upon by Mr Hamill, either together or individually, in my opinion, does not disclose relevant latent error.
59It may be doubted that subsequent sentences in other cases which differ from the sentence under appeal are capable of demonstrating error. But as learned senior counsel relied on them for that purpose I will attempt to deal with them. In R v Hughes a former police officer pleaded guilty to two counts of misconduct in public office and two counts of knowingly giving false evidence before the Police Integrity Commission. In relation to the false evidence charges, concurrent terms of imprisonment, each of six months, were imposed. For the first misconduct in public office offence, consisting of failing to report admissions made by persons involved in stealing a car, a fixed term of seven months was imposed accumulated on the prior sentences by two months. In relation to the second misconduct in public office offence, consisting of accessing the COPS data base to provide information orally to the persons involved in stealing the car about the police investigation into that matter, a sentence of imprisonment having a non-parole period of nine months and an additional term also of nine months was imposed. The criminality covered by that sentence included creating a false entry in the COPS system to cover her tracks. There was an accumulation on the previous sentence of one month so that the total effective non-parole period was one of twelve months, with an additional term of nine months.
60The offender was a junior police officer who committed the offences to help her then boyfriend. The sentencing judge found that the offender had deliberately lied in her evidence on the proceedings on sentence; that she knew the information she had obtained from the COPS data base would be passed onto criminal elements; and that she was fully aware of the seriousness of the criminality of her misconduct. She had a history of mental illness going back to her teenage years involving self-harm, for which she had received medical treatment. The sentencing judge did not give the mental health problems significant weight.  He regarded the offences as ""extremely serious"". In fact he regarded the objective seriousness as being in the upper range. In determining the length of the sentence, his Honour took into account the offender's subjective case including her mental health history (to some extent), the early plea of guilty and her prior good character. The offender was 22 at the date of the offending.
61On one view, the sentence may look lenient when compared with the sentence in the present case. On the other hand, the two counts of misconduct in public office related to the circumstances of a single day.  Whilst investigation may have been prejudiced, the matter did not have the same potential for widespread publication of information relating to a large number of persons. No documents were distributed. Moreover, and, in my view significantly, the offending, although described by the sentencing judge in strong language like that used by Judge Sides in the present case, did not range over a comparatively lengthy period like the present case, nor did it have the multiple facets that the present offending exhibited.
62In Farrell a long serving police officer entered a late plea of guilty to the offence of misconduct in public office. He requested that seven other offences, each carrying a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, be taken into account on a Form 1. The gravamen of the principal offence was agreeing to provide police intelligence orally to a businessman who was a close personal friend. The context appears to have been the businessman's alleged involvement in the supply of restricted performance enhancing substances, which the police officer used. The businessman had been under police suspicion and lawful surveillance. After an incident in which the businessman's vehicle was stopped and inspected by police, he complained to the police officer, who then accessed the police database. The trial judge was satisfied that the results of the offender's search of the police database were passed on to the businessman, albeit using a telephone line which was not subject to authorised surveillance. Five of the Form 1 offences related to instances of the supply of police information to other persons, some of it unsolicited, and two charges of possessing prescribed restricted performance enhancing substances. 
63The sentencing judge gave a small discount for the late plea, discounted the offender's prior good character because of the nature of the offending, but otherwise accepted his strong subjective case. Central to the subjective case was evidence that the 40 year old officer, apparently of previously unblemished record, ""went through a period in [his] life where [he] literally.... ran out of control, that [he was] doing things and saying things which were not characteristic of [his] previous life"". He was sentenced to a non-parole period of twelve months with an additional term of twelve months.
64Again, in my view, with respect, the similarities are superficial. The offence of misconduct in public office, as is so often said of other offences, is by its nature protean, covering a very wide field of offending. As Sir Anthony Mason NPJ pointed out in Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR (2002) 5 HKCFAR 381, at 817 [84] - 818 [86], it covers a very wide range of ""serious misconduct ... determined [by] having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the office holder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities"". Again, as with other offences, it is not helpful to attempt to break it up into artificial sub-categories such as the unauthorised dissemination of sensitive police information by serving police officers, simply because the particular circumstances of a given offence, and a given offender, are likely to vary enormously.
65Moreover, two cases only, said to be alike because they fall into a putative sub-category, are not capable of providing useful material that may establish a pattern, even if the categorisation is valid, because the data they supply is completely insufficient for that purpose. Even were it otherwise, past sentences do not establish the correct range: Director of Public Prosecutions (Commonwealth) v De La Rosa at 98 [303] - [305] per Simpson J, approved in Hili at 537 [54]. Consistency of approach does not call for numerical equivalence. Even marked differences from sentences imposed in other cases does not of itself justify appellate intervention:  Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584 at 604 [58].
66A consideration of the reasons for sentence in each of Hughes and Farrell demonstrates that the approach adopted by each of the sentencing judges to the sentencing task, including the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending, was substantially the same as in the present case. That there are differences in outcome is demonstrative only of differences in the facts, matters and circumstances relevant to sentencing in each case.
67I would reject Ground 3.
68I am not of the opinion that some other sentence in law is warranted for this offending and this offender.  
69The orders I propose are:
(1)Grant leave to appeal; and
(2)Appeal dismissed.

2705763,Police v RH [2013] NSWChC 7,"Judgment

FORENSIC PROCEDURE APPLICATION

1These proceedings involve an unusual factual scenario, and this gives rise to a contested forensic procedure application in this matter.

2The application is supported by an affidavit sworn by Senior Constable Robert Thompson on 29 October 2013.

3The respondent, the Young Person RH (referred to herein as ""the Young Person"") is a 17 year old aboriginal male and is a child for the purposes of the Crimes (Forensic Procedures) Act 2000 (the Act).

4In this regard s 3 of the Act defines a ""child"" as meaning 
""a person who is at least 10 years of age but under 18 years of age"".

5Briefly, the relevant facts are that the Young Person has pleaded guilty to, and has been sentenced, in respect of a charge of break, enter and steal, relating to premises at Duchess Close, Nowra. The offence occurred on 10 September 2013. During a police forensic examination conducted in relation to this offence, the Young Person's fingerprints were located within the premises, which led to his arrest, and subsequent plea of guilty.

6Further, a DNA profile of an unknown male was obtained from a swab taken of a red stain found on the leg of an upturned chair within the premises.

7The police believe that ""there is now evidence to indicate the accused was in company of co-offenders at the time"" of this offence - (see paragraph 9 of Sen. Const. Thompson's affidavit).

8The Young Person does not have a recorded DNA profile on the DNA database. 

9Notwithstanding that the police believe the Young Person was not alone when this offence was committed, based on the known involvement of the Young Person in the offence committed at Duchess Close in Nowra on 10 September 2013, the Police hold a reasonable suspicion that the unknown DNA profile recovered from those premises is that of the Young Person.

10The Police have undertaken a DNA Scene to Scene link analysis based on the unknown DNA profile taken from the Duchess Close, Nowra premises. This has resulted in this unknown male DNA profile being linked to two other crime scenes.

11The first linked crime scene relates to a break, enter and steal offence that occurred on 25 November 2009 at the business premises of Society Streetwear and Boards, in Rodway Arcade, Nowra. The perpetrator(s) remains unknown to Police. A forensic examination of that crime scene resulted in a DNA profile of an unknown male being obtained from a red substance located inside the store, on a piece of paper at the point of entry.

12The second linked crime scene relates to a break, enter and steal offence that occurred on 7 June 2013 at the business premises of Stanley John Menswear, in Junction Street, Nowra. Similarly, the perpetrator(s) remains unknown to Police. Also in this case, a forensic examination of the crime scene resulted in a DNA profile of an unknown male being obtained from a red substance, resembling blood, on a shard of glass at the point of entry.

13The DNA profiles of the unknown male taken from both of these linked crime scenes have been identified as matching the DNA profile of the unknown male obtained from the Duchess Close, Nowra offence, that is the offence in which the Young Person was involved.

14Based on this evidence, the Police hold a reasonable suspicion that the two DNA profiles of the unknown male person obtained from the two linked crime scenes are those of the Young Person, and accordingly he is a suspect in those two linked crime scenes. 

15A ""suspect"" is defined in section 3 of the Act as:
""suspect"" means the following:
(a) a person whom a police officer suspects on reasonable grounds has committed an offence,
(b) a person charged with an offence,
(c) a person who has been summoned to appear before a court in relation to an offence alleged to have been committed by the person.

16Accordingly an application has been made pursuant to s 26 of the Act for a final order authorising the carrying out of a forensic procedure on the Young Person, pursuant to s 24 of the Act, namely the taking of a buccal swab or the taking of a sample of hair, other than pubic hair, being a non-intimate forensic procedure.

17A non-intimate forensic procedure is defined in the Act as follows:
""non-intimate forensic procedure"" means any of the following:
(a) an external examination of a part of a person's body, other than the person's private parts, that requires touching of the body or removal of clothing,
(b) the carrying out on a person of a self-administered buccal swab,
(c) the taking from a person of a sample of the person's hair, other than pubic hair,
(d) the taking from a person of a sample (such as a nail clipping) of the person's nails or of matter from under the person's nails,
(e) the taking from a person of a sample of any matter, by swab or washing,from any external part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(f) the taking from a person of a sample of any matter, by vacuum suction,scraping or lifting by tape, from any external part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(g) the taking from a person of the person's hand print, finger print, foot print or toe print,
(h) the taking of a photograph of a part of a person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(i) the taking from a person of an impression or cast of a wound from a part of the person's body, other than the person's private parts,
(j) the taking of measurement of a person's body or any part of a person's body (other than the person's private parts) whether or not involving the marking of the person's body.

18The application came before the Nowra Children's Court on 7 November 2013 when the proceedings were adjourned to 21 November for submissions to be made in relation to the forensic procedure application.

19On the last mentioned date, the Court received written submissions from Mr Jacob Tate of the Aboriginal Legal Service on behalf of the Young Person, and oral submissions from the Police Prosecutor.

20In his written submissions Mr Tate contends (in summary) that the Court could not be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Young Person's DNA was found at the Duchess Close premises. At best there is only a tentative link. If this submission is accepted, the Court could not be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Young Person is a suspect in the two linked offences in Rodway Arcade and Junction Street, as detailed above.

21In relation to the Duchess Close premises, Mr Tate submits that a legitimate basis does not exist to undertake a forensic procedure to confirm or disprove the Young Person's involvement in the offence relating to those premises, because it has already been confirmed that the Young Person committed the offence, and the Young Person has been convicted and sentenced in relation to the offence.

22In this regard, in paragraph 4 of the supporting affidavit to the Forensic Procedure Application, it is stated that the Young Person ""is a suspect within the meaning of s 3 of the Act, namely that on 10th September 2013....(he)....unlawfully gained entry to the premises at 2 Duchess Close Nowra....."" (emphasis added). The supporting affidavit also sets out further details relating to that offence and then sets out details of the two linked premises.

23Paragraph 5 of the supporting affidavit reads ""I suspect that (the Young Person) has committed the following offence(s): a) Break & Enter house etc steal value <= $60,000-T1 contrary to section 112(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900"".

24Under the heading ""Other matters: s24(1)(b) of the Act"", the supporting affidavit reads ""The young person is believed to have committed the offences due to his admission to involvement in one of the three incidents where matched DNA profiles have been obtained"".

25It seem clear, in my view, that the police are proceeding on the basis that the Young Person is a suspect in respect of all three offences described throughout the application and supporting affidavit, and not restricted to the premises at Rodway Arcade and Junction Street Nowra.

26Mr Tate further submits, and the Court accepts, that the purpose of the Forensic Procedure legislation ""is not to enable investigating police...to identify a person as a suspect; it is to facilitate the procurement of evidence against a person who already is a suspect"" (Orban v Bayliss [2004] NSWSC 428 per Simpson J at paragraph 31).

27In response the Prosecutor submits that the Court is dealing with the test set out in s 24 of the Act relating to non-intimate forensic procedures. The Prosecutor submits that the finding of the DNA profile at the scene of the premises in respect of which the Young Person has already pleaded guilty is, on the balance of probabilities, a sufficient basis to regard him as a suspect in respect of the offences relating to the two other premises, where the same DNA profile was located. This, the Prosecutor submits, is a classic case where the carrying out of the forensic procedure will produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove the Young Person's involvement in the two break and enter offences committed at Rodway Arcade and Junction Street, as above mentioned.

THE RELEVANT LAW

28Sections 23 and 24 of the Act are particularly relevant to these proceedings. Section 23 of the Act provides:

Section 23 Circumstances in which Magistrate or other authorised officer may order forensic procedure
An order may be made by a Magistrate under section 24, or by an authorised officer under section 32, for the carrying out of a forensic procedure on a suspect if:
(a) the suspect is not under arrest and has not consented to the forensic procedure, or
(b) the suspect is under arrest and has not consented to the forensic procedure, or
(c) the suspect is a child or an incapable person.

29Section 24 of the Act provides:
Section 24 Final order for carrying out forensic procedure
(1) A Magistrate may order the carrying out of a forensic procedure if satisfied on the balance of probabilities:
(a) that the circumstances referred to in subsection (2) or (3) exist, and
(b) that the carrying out of such a procedure is justified in all the circumstances.

(2) In the case of an intimate forensic procedure: [Not relevant]

(3) In the case of a non-intimate forensic procedure:
(a) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed an offence, and
(b) there must be reasonable grounds to believe that the procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offence referred to in paragraph (a).

(4) In determining whether or not the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances, the Magistrate must balance the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect's physical integrity, having regard to the following:
(a) the gravity of the alleged offence,
(b) the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed,
(c) the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence,
(d) the age, cultural background and physical and mental health of the suspect, to the extent to which they are known,
(e) in the case of a suspect who is a child or an incapable person, the best interests of the child or person,
(f) such other practicable ways of obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence as are less intrusive,
(g) such reasons as the suspect may have given for refusing to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure concerned,
(h) in the case of a suspect who is in custody, the period for which the suspect has been in custody and the reasons for any delay in the making of an application for an order under this section,
(i) such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant to the balancing of those interests.

DISPOSITION

30Given the circumstances of this case it seems, in my opinion, the appropriate questions to be answered are: are there reasonable grounds to believe that the Young Person's DNA was found at the Duchess Close premises?

31If so, are there reasonable grounds to believe the Young Person is a suspect in the two linked offences in Rodway Arcade and Junction Street premises?

32It follows, in my opinion, that if the answer to the first question is negative, then there is no basis to believe, on reasonable grounds or otherwise, that the Young Person is a suspect in the two linked offences mentioned above.

33In my view, if the first question is answered in the affirmative, then it is possible that the second question can also be answered in the affirmative.

34It is well established that a Magistrate hearing a forensic procedure application must bring his/her own independent evaluation to the evidence which the prosecution contends amounts to reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect committed the relevant offence; that there existed reasonable grounds for believing that any of the forensic procedures sought might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove the respondent committed the relevant offence; and, the forensic procedures are justified in all the circumstances (taking into account the s 24(4) criteria). It is insufficient to simply recount that it is alleged that the suspected person committed the relevant offence: Orban v Bayliss at [56].

35Turning to the first question that I have posed above, namely are there reasonable grounds to believe that the Young Person's DNA was found at the Duchess Close premises? The relevant facts are that it has been established by fingerprint evidence, followed by a plea of guilty, that the Young Person was responsible for breaking into the premises and stealing property from those premises. There is no dispute that the Young Person is a suspect in relation to that offence. In my view this does give rise to a reasonable belief that the Young Person's DNA was found inside the premises. The fact that DNA of other persons may also be present inside the premises, including that of any co-offenders, does not in my view, diminish the possibility that the DNA belongs to the Young Person, who on the evidence, was present inside the premises.

36Accordingly, in my view there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Young Person's DNA was found at the Duchess Close premises. Consequently, there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Young person is a suspect in relation to the two other linked premises.

37Turning to the considerations set out in s 24(4) of the Act in determining whether or not the carrying out of the forensic procedure is justified in all the circumstances, and in balancing the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect's physical integrity, the Court has regard to:
(a) the gravity of the alleged offence: - offences of break, enter and steal, contrary to s 112 of the Crimes Act, are serious offences and cannot be regarded as being trivial;
(b) the seriousness of the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed: - apart from the gravity of the detected offences, the Court is not aware of any other particular serious circumstances;
(c) the degree to which the suspect is alleged to have participated in the commission of the offence: - similarly the Court is not aware of the degree of the Young Person's involvement in the offences, apart from being inside the premises that have been broken into and property stolen;
(d) the age, cultural background and physical and mental health of the suspect, to the extent to which they are known: - the Court is aware that the Young Person is currently 17 years of age and is an Aboriginal male. The Court is not aware of any particular physical or mental health issues in relation to the Young Person;
(e) in the case of a suspect who is a child or an incapable person, the best interests of the child or person: - the Young Person is currently serving a custodial sentence. The Court takes the view that it is in the Young Person's best interests to take responsibility for his actions, in the hope that his prospects for rehabilitation can be improved;
(f) such other practicable ways of obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence as are less intrusive: - given the circumstances of this case, there are not other practicable ways of obtaining the evidence;
(g) such reasons as the suspect may have given for refusing to consent to the carrying out of the forensic procedure concerned: - the Young Person is a child and it is not appropriate to ask a child to give consent to the application;
(h) in the case of a suspect who is in custody, the period for which the suspect has been in custody and the reasons for any delay in the making of an application for an order under this section: - the Young Person is in custody serving a Control Order for the Duchess Close offence, and there has been no undue delay in making the application;
(i) such other matters as the Magistrate considers relevant to the balancing of those interests: - In relation to this consideration, and in balancing the public interest in obtaining evidence as to whether or not the suspect committed the alleged offence against the public interest in upholding the suspect's physical integrity, the Court is mindful of the value of DNA evidence in the investigation of crime, which is embodied in the legislation, which in turn, in Part 11 of the Act, makes provision for and use of a DNA database.

38In conclusion, I am satisfied there are reasonable grounds to believe that the suspect has committed the three offences mention above, and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the forensic procedure might produce evidence tending to confirm or disprove that the suspect has committed the offences. 

39The application for the taking of a self-administered buccal swab is granted and the Young Person is to provide such swab within 21 days.

2705765,Randall v State of New South Wales [2013] NSWDC 277,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Mr Wayne Anthony John Randall, brings an action for damages for the torts of assault and false imprisonment. The plaintiff claims compensatory damages, aggravated damages and exemplary damages. He brings his action against the State of New South Wales as being vicariously liable by statute for the wrongs committed by members of the New South Wales Police. The first three paragraphs in the statement of claim are these:

""(1) At all material times, Police Officers involved in this matter were members of the NSW Police Force and, as such, were, pursuant to s 6 of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983, deemed to be persons in the service of the Crown. 

(2) Pursuant to s 8 of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983, the defendant is vicariously liable in respect of torts committed by persons in the service of the Crown. 

(3) The plaintiff is entitled to bring these proceedings against the defendant pursuant to s 5 of the Crown Proceedings Act 1988.""

The first two pleas in the defence are these: 
""(1) As to paragraphs 1 and 2 of the statement of claim, the defendant is unable to admit vicarious liability for the actions of the unnamed and unidentified police officers referred to in the statement of claim pursuant to the provisions of Pt 4 and ss 9-9C of the Law Reform (Vicarious Liability) Act 1983 NSW for the reason that notwithstanding particulars requested from the plaintiff and inquiries made up to the present time, the defendant has not been able to identify such police officers. However, the defendant's inquiries are ongoing and should it transpire as a result of further inquiries that the police officers are able to be identified, then in those circumstances the defendant may file an amended defence making the necessary admissions, if appropriate. 

(2) As to para 3 of the statement of claim, the defendant says that having regard to its present inability to identify the alleged police officers, it cannot make an admission pursuant to the provisions of the Crown Proceedings Act 1988 (NSW) that it is the correct entity to sue in respect of the allegations raised by the plaintiff.""

The defence was never amended. However a number of members of the New South Wales Police have been identified during the course of the hearing, and a large number of them have given evidence. For reasons which will in due course become apparent, the persons alleged by the plaintiff to be those involved in what he claims were tortious acts against him have been identified, and the defendant has not taken any point that the State of New South Wales is not vicariously liable for the actions of the named police officers. 

2The relevant parts of the statement of claim are these: 

""(4) Between 12.30am and 2am on 23 April 2011, the plaintiff was on Canterbury Street in Casino in the state of New South Wales.

(5) At or about that time, the plaintiff was filming via his mobile phone the conduct of Police speaking to another citizen.

(6) At or about that time, the plaintiff was assaulted by a Police Officer.

(7) The Police Officer assaulted the plaintiff by:

(a) pushing/shoving the plaintiff (the 'first assault');

(b) deploying capsicum spray to the plaintiff's face and neck area whilst the plaintiff had raised his arms in the air (the 'second assault')[.]

(8) Immediately thereafter the plaintiff was arrested by one or more uniformed Police Officers by placing him under arrest.

(9) At that point the plaintiff was completely under the control and restraint of the Police Officers and was now detained against his will.""

The statement of claim then provides particulars of the ""wrongful arrest"". The statement of claim then continues thus:

""(11) By virtue of being wrongly arrested the plaintiff was thereby falsely imprisoned.

(12) The plaintiff repeats the matters set out in paras 1 to 11 above.

(13) The plaintiff was physically arrested and taken into custody (the imprisonment).

(14) The plaintiff was taken by police vehicle to the Casino Police Station and placed into custody in the presence of the Police Officers.

(15) The plaintiff was released from custody around 2am on 23 April 2011 and therefore was falsely imprisoned for around two hours.

(16) Throughout the duration of being wrongfully arrested and falsely imprisoned the plaintiff was completely deprived of his liberty.

(17) The plaintiff was released without charge.""

The remaining paragraphs in the statement of claim allege damage and particulars of both compensatory damages, aggravated damages, and exemplary damages are also given. In para 15 I have amended what was pleaded, namely ""1.30am"", to ""2am"", nunc pro tunc, as that amendment should have been made when the plaintiff amended par 4 of the statement of claim on 19 March 2013. The defendant does not admit any of the allegations made in pars 4 to 17, but specifically denies the causation of any damage.

3As the plaintiff's case was eventually argued, he was assaulted at about 1.20am on Saturday, 23 April 2011, and immediately arrested without due cause. He was then conveyed in a caged police truck to the Casino Police Station, where he was imprisoned in a cell until treated by ambulance officers and released from custody without charge shortly after 1.44am, which is the time at which the ambulance officers finished their treatment of the plaintiff. The false imprisonment is alleged to have occupied approximately 30 minutes.

4The defendant's case is, in essence, that the plaintiff's allegations are a fabrication. One view of the defence case is that the person treated by the ambulance officer was not the plaintiff, but the plaintiff's cousin, Colin Laurie, a 15-year-old Aboriginal youth. At the time of the alleged torts, the plaintiff was aged 20, and although he is a quarter-caste Aboriginal, he has the appearance of an Anglo-Celt. Another version of events open on the defence case is that the plaintiff pretended to police that he was Colin Laurie. In any event, the defendant puts the plaintiff to proof of his causes of action.

5Relevant persons in these proceedings are the plaintiff, who was born on 15 October 1990, and was 20 years old at the time. Another person involved is his brother, Colin Randall, who was born on 6 November 1992, and was aged 18 at the time. Also mentioned is the plaintiff's cousin, Joshua Harvey, who was 22 years old at the time. The other relevant person is Colin Laurie, who was born on 23 December 1995, and was at the relevant time 15 years old.

6Police involved in this matter are Senior Constable Michael John Opryszko who, on the evening of 22 to 23 April 2011, was working alone and driving the detectives' vehicle which has been described as a Pajero and had the call sign Casino 14. There were then those police working out of a Ford Falcon sedan which had the call sign Casino 38. Those officers were ""Alpha"" and ""Beta"". In a caged police vehicle with the call sign Casino 21 were ""Gamma"" and ""Delta"". Also involved were two members of the Highway Patrol, Leading Senior Constable Stephen Gordon Nixon and Senior Constable Michael Stewart whose vehicle is variously described but according to the police roster, exhibit D, was known as RM0069 and was also given a call sign of R207. Assisting the Casino police on the evening and night in question were two members of the New South Wales Police from Kyogle, driving a vehicle with the call sign Kyogle 23. They were Senior Constable Michael Douglas McCormack and Constable Claire Beek who subsequently married and was also promoted, and when giving evidence, was known as Senior Constable Claire Tuckett. Although Senior Constable McCormack and Constable Beek had the call sign Kyogle 23, that vehicle was actually out of service and they were driving a caged police truck identified as Bonalbo 26. I will refer to this pair as the officers in Kyogle 23. Where I need to refer to police officers, I shall refer to their rank at the dates now in question, 22 and 23 April 2011. 

7Also involved in this matter are two members of the New South Wales Ambulance Service. They are now retired paramedic Mr Glen Murray Stalker and Mr A Mactier. I shall refer to these ambulance officers as Mr Stalker and Mr Mactier. 

8The next thing to bear in mind is the course of these proceedings. I commenced a sitting of the civil jurisdiction of this Court at Coffs Harbour on Monday, 11 March 2013. After taking appearances, this exchange occurred:

""HIS HONOUR: The estimate here is one day. Is that correct, Mr Steirn?

STEIRN: Pardon, yes, that would be correct.

SPARTALIS: It would be a very short matter, your Honour, if it is.""

The case started on Monday 11 March, and continued till Friday 15 March. Then recommenced again at Coffs Harbour on Monday, 18 March, and the evidence was completed on Tuesday, 19 March 2013. The estimate was one day and the evidence took seven. The curial process was interrupted repeatedly with calls for documents and their production and the issuing of at least one subpoena, urgently, for production, and evidence was adduced on a piecemeal basis. It was an extended form of discovery which certainly prolonged the proceedings and raised new issues from time to time.

9I make no criticism of any of the lawyers involved in this case. It appears that the matter developed a life of its own as various avenues were explored. The matter was eventually fixed for two days in Sydney, 3 and 4 December 2013, the idea being that addresses would take place on the 3rd and judgment would be delivered on the 4th. Mr Spartalis addressed me from 10am to 4.40pm on Tuesday and Mr Steirn addressed me from 10am till 3.40 yesterday and was followed by a short address in reply by Mr Spartalis. That caused me to have to give judgment today. 

10The plaintiff's case was a very simple one. The plaintiff is a usually resident in South Grafton where he lives with his mother. At the time of giving evidence he was employed by Hungry Jack's and had been so employed for five years. He has been undertaking Certificates in Sound Production, and at the time he gave evidence, was studying for Certificate IV. On 22 April 2011 the plaintiff went to Casino to attend a friend's 18th birthday. He was not a regular visitor to Casino but he decided to go there to celebrate his friend's birthday. 

11The evidence discloses that there was a large 18th birthday party being held in Casino on 22 April 2011 and the friend identified by the plaintiff was ""Bernie"". There is also reference in the police evidence to the large 18th birthday party in Canterbury Street but, whether that was Bernie's party or another, the evidence does not disclose. Nothing however turns on that. In order to attend the party the plaintiff was to stay with one of his aunts, Christine Bennett. The plaintiff had another aunt, Barbara Harvey, who lived in Boronia Crescent, Casino, and one can infer that Barbara Harvey is the mother of Joshua Harvey whom I mentioned earlier. 

12The plaintiff attended Bernie's party and left it and went to the local RSL Club. The RSL Club in Casino is known as the RSM Club, being, as I understand it, an abbreviation for Returned Soldiers' Memorial Club. When the plaintiff went to the RSM he went there with his brother, Colin, and with his cousin, Josh Harvey. According to the plaintiff's evidence-in-chief when he left the RSM Club he was walking ""home"" with his brother and his cousin, Joshua. They were going back to his aunt's house. The plaintiff was not challenged about his journey from the RSM Club back to his aunt's house. The plaintiff commenced his narrative of what happened on the evening in question with a long answer recorded at p 10 of the transcript. I paraphrase it in this fashion: The plaintiff, his brother, and Joshua saw as they were walking home some police on their left. The plaintiff and Joshua started to muck around and then Colin Randall advised that he wished to go home. They went round a corner and the plaintiff then realised that his brother was also mucking up. The plaintiff said that he then looked to his right as he was in West Street and noticed that his brother was not ahead of him, heading directly towards his aunt's place and he saw lights on the side of the school in West Street and then he saw police. The plaintiff then said that his brother was on the opposite side of the street to him and he saw the police approaching his brother. He saw them jump out of a car and then go towards Colin Randall and he saw them, ""like, intimidate him and everything and, yeah, like they were pushing him around.""

13When the plaintiff saw this interaction between the police and his brother Colin, he took out his BlackBerry mobile phone and tried to obtain a video recording of this interaction. The plaintiff said that he was hiding behind one of the caged police trucks, familiarly known as paddy wagons, because he knew that the police were not going to react kindly if they caught him making a video recording of their activities with his brother. The plaintiff indicated that he was holding his phone in front of his face with a hand on each side of his phone. The plaintiff said that he was recording for at least thirty seconds, and perhaps as much as a minute when this happened:

""Well, as I had the phone in my face and I was recording and listening to what the police were saying and that, yeah, a police officer just like came up out of nowhere and surprised me and pushed me in the chest and then said like, 'What are you doing,' and I was, like, 'I'm recording you police, like, there's five of you on my younger brother and, you know, I'm recording that,' and then he said, 'Don't assault a police officer.'""

The plaintiff denied that he assaulted any police officer. The plaintiff said that when he heard that expression he was scared and he realised, or rather thought, that the policeman was trying to get his phone, which was being used as a video camera, from him. The plaintiff raised his hands above his shoulders with the camera and the police officer then said, ""Assault me again and I'll pepper spray you."" According to the plaintiff that was said in an intimidatory fashion. 

14The plaintiff then said that the policeman pulled out his pepper spray and sprayed him and he dropped to the ground. He said that he was unable to see anything after the pepper spray was sprayed into his face and he dropped his phone and covered his face. He dropped to the ground because, not being able to see anything, he was scared and if he was on his feet something else might happen to him. The plaintiff said that after being sprayed he was unable to physically open his eyes and his whole face was burning. He said that he was on the ground for about five seconds or so and held both his hands over his face. He said that he was, in essence, required to hold his hands over his face for nearly all the time, ""99.9%"" of the time until he was eventually decontaminated by ambulance officers. After a short time on the ground the plaintiff said that he felt an arm grab him on the shoulder and he heard the words, ""You're under arrest,"" and then he felt another arm on his other side and he was lifted up off the ground, he believed by two officers, and was pushed into the back of a caged police truck. He believed that they were two male officers wearing the uniform of the New South Wales Police.

15He heard the door of the paddy wagon being shut. He heard the motor switched on, and they drove the plaintiff to what he believed was a police station. The plaintiff accepted that he was saying things to the police such as, ""What did I do wrong?"" The trip to the police station was some five minutes long. Five minutes is generally used in the vernacular as indicating a relevantly short time, just like the biblical forty days and nights indicates a very long time. The evidence from police officers indicates that the length of a journey from the corner of West Street and Canterbury Street, Casino, to the Casino Police Station on the corner of Richmond and Walker Streets takes about one minute. This exchange then occurred:

""HIS HONOUR

Q. Yes. Well, see all I'm getting at is the nearest other police station is at probably Lismore, which is about a half hour away, were you in the car that long?
A. No, I wasn't in there for half an hour.

Q. Or Grafton, which is about an hour away?
A. No, it wouldn't have been an hour, no.

Q. West would be Kyogle, there for about an hour in the back of a paddy wagon for about an hour?
A. No.

STEIRN

Q. Well, why do you know it's Casino Police Station?
A. Well, when, when the ambulance fixed up my eyes like I could squint a little bit like I had to see like that.

Q. No. We just want to know why - do I take it, I won't lead but...

STEIRN: Is there any dispute it's the Casino Police Station.

SPARTALIS: Yes.""

It can be seen from the outset that everything was in dispute. There is no longer any dispute that if the plaintiff went to a police station, it was the Casino Police Station. The plaintiff said that when he was eventually released from the police station he walked home to his auntie's house which was a walk of about half an hour. There can be no doubt that if what the plaintiff says be correct that he was taken to the Casino Police Station rather than some other station.

16When the caged police vehicle arrived at the police station, the cage was opened, the plaintiff was grabbed by an arm and was led into the police station. Because he could not see his way, he needed to follow a police officer. When he tried to open his eyes he felt more stinging than when he had his eyes covered with his hands and, presumably, shut. The plaintiff said he was put in one of the cells and he just sat down on a seat and put his hands over his eyes. He described the seat as being a ""cold metal seat"". It is clear from other evidence the plaintiff gave that when he was placed in this cell that the door was shut because he could recall the door being opened later. 

17The plaintiff was asked if he had any discussion with the police. The plaintiff said that he was remonstrating, in essence, with the police about why they applied capsicum spray to his face. He said he made that inquiry, if not demand, multiple times because he wanted to know why he had been sprayed, what he had done wrong. After being in a cell for some time, he recalled the door of the cell being opened and then he noticed ambulance officers treating his face. The plaintiff said he saw two ambulance officers, and then this evidence was given:

""Q. Could you describe the treatment by feeling, what did you feel that they were doing for you?
A. It just felt like a conditioner or something on my face and just water, like, just felt--

Q. Did he tell you something about it at the time as to what it was?
A. It was like a shampoo, he said, it was a shampoo or like a shampoo.

Q. Is that your words or his?
A. His words.""

That evidence is perfectly acceptable because Mr Stalker gave this evidence as to the ""high-tech"" treatment for oleo-capsicum spray on the human face:

""Our treatment is, I mean it's quite simply it's the use of, we have little satchels of Johnson's baby shampoo and we use that, place the patient's head over the sink and all over the patient's head, yeah, and then we get the patient to rub it all through them and over where they're stinging and then copious amounts of water and shampoo.""

The description of the treatment which the plaintiff said he was given is consistent with his actually being treated, and the application of Johnson's baby shampoo by ambulance officers is not something that most members of the community would expect. They would expect something much more sophisticated than a mere proprietary, baby product. In other words, what the plaintiff said about his treatment had the ring of truth about it.

18The plaintiff said that he was treated for, ""[m]aybe five minutes but it would have not been much longer than that."" The plaintiff estimated that he was in the cell for about thirty minutes to an hour before the advent of the ambulance officers. Again, that was only an estimate of time and on the facts of the case is an overestimate, but it may represent merely the experience of a long, long time, as far as a young man was concerned, sitting by himself in a police cell suffering from a discomfort and being, in effect, blinded, waiting for treatment.

19After the ambulance officers had treated the plaintiff, a police officer gave back to the plaintiff his mobile phone. After telling me about the police officer giving back his mobile phone the plaintiff said this:

""I was speaking to him, like, 'Why did you pepper spray me?' like, I don't know if it was him but, you know, he's a police officer so I was saying, 'Why did you pepper spray me?' and he still didn't give me no clear, clear answer or anything like that and then I said, 'I live in Grafton,' and...he said, 'You'll see me around a lot more,' along them lines.""

The plaintiff said that he was then let go and he went home to his aunt's place. The next day, which I inferred was on 23 April, the plaintiff checked his phone and noticed that all the video recordings which he had made on his phone had been deleted. 

20In March 2011 the plaintiff had attended a music festival in Brisbane. It was known as Superfest. It was the first such concert that he had attended. His BlackBerry took only one memory stick at a time, as well as having an internal memory. Not only the video film which he exposed prior to his being sprayed with OC spray but also the videos that he had recorded at Superfest had been deleted, as well as any other entries on the memory stick then in his phone and its own internal memory.

21When asked how he felt about being sprayed with OC spray the plaintiff said that he was, ""scared and helpless"". When asked how he felt about being placed in a police cell, the police said he, ""Just hated everything. I was just pretty angry."" He was also upset at the fact that his inquiries of the police were not being answered. When asked how he felt about the fact that, since that time up until giving evidence on 11 March this year, the police were denying that anything untoward had happened to him, he told me it made him feel angry and depressed. 

22In cross-examination, the plaintiff agreed that he had taken alcohol on the evening prior to the events about which he was complaining. Prior to going to the RSM the plaintiff had been drinking Tooheys Extra Dry beer. He said at most he would have drunk a sixpack of those beers, but also estimated that he may have only drunk four. One can safely find that he drank at least four bottles of Tooheys Extra Dry. At the RSM Club he drank three cans of Bundaberg Red Rum and cola. The plaintiff is a tall man but a thin one. I can accept that he was affected by alcohol at the time of the events of which complained. He went on to say that he went to Bernie's party at about some time between 7.30 and 8pm on 22 April. When cross-examined about his interaction with the police the plaintiff told me that he was, before being sprayed, pushed in the chest by a policeman. He said that the policeman said to him, ""What are you doing?"". The plaintiff said that the policeman pushed him hard enough for him to stumble backwards. He went on to give this evidence:

""...he pushed me in the chest and he's like what, you know, 'What do you think you're doing?', I'm like, 'I'm recording youse, what youse doing to my younger brother, who's about five years', then he said, 'Assault me again.', then I put my hand up in the air, you know, 'I didn't assault you', blah, blah, blah, blah, and then he just pulled out his pepper spray and pepper sprayed me.""

One will recall from the statement of claim which I have quoted that the first assault alleged was a pushing/shoving of the plaintiff, and the second assault was the deployment of OC spray on the plaintiff's person. The plaintiff omitted to tell me in chief of the first assault, but he did volunteer it in cross-examination and it can hardly be suggested that it was some novel invention of the plaintiff because it had been pleaded in the statement of claim which commenced these proceedings.

23Mr Spartalis then pressed the witness very properly to try to identify the police officer who confronted him. He described him as a ""big boy"", and he said that he was, ""a lot bigger than the rest of the cops that [were] over there."" He then volunteered that the officer was obese. The plaintiff said that he was 175 centimetres tall, and that this policeman was about five centimetres shorter than him, placing his height at about 170 centimetres. When asked about the colour of the policeman's hair, the plaintiff said that the policeman was wearing a hat or cap. On the second day, the plaintiff described the officer as being stocky or solidly built and was unable to give his age, but he said, ""I wouldn't say he was young."" Many police officers are male, in their 30s and 40s, many these days still are heavily built, and it is common these days for policemen to wear baseball caps with police insignia. A height of 170 centimetres is not unusual. The plaintiff really gives only a generic description of the policeman who he said assaulted him and does not enable one to make any particular finding based on any description.

24When pressed as to why he could not give any better description of his assailant, the plaintiff told me that he was more concerned about trying to protect himself than he was in trying to identify the policeman or take particular note of any identifying feature. I can accept the plaintiff's evidence in that regard. 

25The plaintiff was then cross-examined about his cousin, Colin Laurie. The plaintiff told me that Colin Laurie had been at Bernie's party but he did not go with the plaintiff and his brother and Joshua Harvey to the RSM Club because he was too young to go to licensed premises, and also that Colin Laurie was not with him ""through any of this incident"", meaning the interaction of the police with Colin Randall, and the interaction of the police with the plaintiff.

26The plaintiff then said that he was staying with his aunt, Christine Bennett, who lived near the train station at Casino, and not with Barbara Harvey who lived at Boronia Crescent, Casino, where Colin Laurie was staying. By looking at the map, exhibit H, one can see that if one follows Canterbury Street due west from the RSM Club which has been marked with a red cross, one arrives very close to the Casino railway station. Boronia Crescent, Casino, is not shown on exhibit H, but it is shown on exhibit O, and it is a long way away from the intersection of West and Canterbury Streets, Casino, and a long way away from both the police station and the RSM Club.

27The plaintiff was asked whether when he was in custody at the Casino Police Station he saw or heard anyone else. He said he did not. He was then asked if his cousin, Colin Laurie, was at the Casino Police Station when he was, and the plaintiff was completely unaware of the presence of any person other than himself and the police at the police station.

28The plaintiff was asked about the caged police truck or paddy wagon into which he was placed. He said that the caged police truck was white. In that regard he is correct. The two police trucks involved in the current matter were Casino 21 and Kyogle 23 and each of them has a white cage at the rear. However, the entry to the caged truck is at the back end of each side of the truck, and not in the middle at the back. The middle of the back of a caged truck is where one would expect to find the entrance to the cage, if it was the old-fashioned Black Maria that used to be used by the Police Force. The plaintiff has been criticised about the fact that he said that he got into the back of the caged truck through the door in the middle of the back but, as the plaintiff pointed out in answer to a question on p 51, he merely assumed the door was at the back of the truck. The evidence does not disclose that he is overly familiar with police caged vehicles. In cross-examination the plaintiff was insistent that he felt two officers placing him into the back of the truck, one on each arm. They pushed him in. They may have lifted up his legs to get him inside the cage.

29The plaintiff also said that when he left the police station he was not given any ""paperwork or anything"". That was what he volunteered in answer to the question that he was not charged with any offence. Presciently, Mr Spartalis cross-examined the plaintiff on the second day of the hearing by suggesting to him that the incident with his brother occurred at approximately 1.20am on 23 April 2011. It is now common ground that the answer to that question should have been in the affirmative, however, the plaintiff would not accede to that at the time because as far as he was aware he was treated by ambulance officers at 1.30 and the time between the events in which he was engaged and his treatment by the ambulance officers was much longer than ten minutes. However, the plaintiff did concede that he didn't know the exact time and was only providing rough estimates. Indeed, the plaintiff's answers given on p 13 of the transcript of 12 March 2013 clearly indicate that the plaintiff was reconstructing to an extent in trying to provide times and the length of any event. 

30In further cross-examination the plaintiff was asked whether the police attempted to decontaminate him from the OC spray and he said that the police did not. This question and answer were then recorded:

""Q. And you're a hundred per cent sure that no police officer assisted you by providing you with water or taking you to a bubbler?

A. No. I don't think they would have after they pepper sprayed me [.] Why would - like it's a bit stupid, you pepper spray someone and then you help them, they were obviously very evil that night in a sense.""

The words ""obviously very evil"" are clearly the plaintiff's perception of what had happened to him on this evening at the hands of police. I then pointed out to Mr Randall that he should try to moderate his language and leave the arguing of the case to his lawyers. However, if one accepts the plaintiff's evidence what happened to him can be seen in many respects to have been evil.

31The plaintiff was then cross-examined about whether he was being aggressive and ranting to the ambulance officers. That part of the cross-examination commences on p 19 of 12 March 2013. The plaintiff's position is that he was not being aggressive or ranting to the ambulance officers but may have been acting in a hostile fashion towards police, and bearing in mind what the plaintiff said happened to him and bearing in mind his state of intoxication, one can understand he may have been aggressive, and he may have been expostulating or ranting. As Mr Stalker pointed out, it is common for those sprayed with capsicum spray to be aggressive because of firstly having been sprayed with capsicum spray, and secondly being in custody.

32Mr Spartalis then returned to the question of whether there was anybody in the Casino Police Station in custody at the time the plaintiff was. The plaintiff answered that inquiry thus:

""Well, according to you there was Colin Laurie there, but I don't recall Colin Laurie being there, as I said I couldn't see. I was in my own world.""

This question and answer were then given:

""Q. Can I suggest this to you, that the person who the ambulance officers treated was a person who identified himself by the name of Colin Laurie?
A. Yeah, and?

The response recorded is a vernacular, rhetorical response which is, in fact, a denial of the proposition that was put to the witness. Clearly it was being suggested to the plaintiff that the person being treated was Colin Laurie. That question must have been put on instructions from a member of the Police Force. Furthermore it is consistent with some evidence given by some members of the Police Force. 

33Later Mr Spartalis put to the plaintiff that he may have given his name as Colin Laurie, but he denied that he did so and pointed out that he was unlikely to put a younger member of his family in a position where he could be seen to be in trouble. The plaintiff denied that two police officers took him ""home"" to Boronia Crescent at about 1.30am on that evening. Clearly that question was also put on instructions provided to Mr Spartalis by the police. The almost final questions put to the plaintiff were these: 

""Q. Let me put this to you, Mr Randall, can I suggest to you that either you were mistaken that you were in police custody at the time alleged?
A. I was mistaken?

Q. Yeah, about being there?
A. The ambulance report proves that I was there in the custody of the police.

Q. Or can I suggest to you that perhaps by error you gave police the name of Colin Laurie, if it was you who in fact the--
A. If I did give the name - okay...

Q. ... police had taken into custody?'
A. Well, why is it that on the ambulance report it says Wayne Randall, not Colin Laurie, and Colin Laurie is not sitting in my position right now. That proves that I was there, the ambulance prove that I was in the police station, I got pepper sprayed, not Colin Laurie. Any further questions.""

In answer to that response Mr Spartalis sat down. 

34Exhibit B are records produced by the Ambulance Service of New South Wales. The Ambulance Service received a call from the police radio at 1:23:19 on the morning of 23 April 2011. The call was answered at 1:25:29. That information is contained in the computer-generated records of the Ambulance Service in exhibit B. According to the manual records an ambulance was booked at 1.23 and arrived at the Casino Police Station at 1.31, and made contact with a patient at 1.32. The complaint was about ""capsicum spray"", and the narrative is this: ""Decontamination of male patient in police custody - patient aggressive and ranting."" The name recorded of the patient is Wayne Randall, but the surname has been misspelt by omitting the final ""l"". The address given for Mr Randall is merely Grafton. His date of birth is not recorded, but his age is recorded as being 20 years old. Mr Stalker gave evidence. He made it clear that he had no independent recollection of treating the plaintiff at the Casino Police Station, but confirmed that he was the officer who carried out the treatment, and he said that the top part of the manual ambulance record had been filled in by his co-worker, Mr Mactier. That apparently is the normal procedure, and the ambulance officer who renders the treatment fills in the lower part of the manually completed ambulance record.

35It is clear from Mr Stalker's evidence that Mr Stalker was at home on call with one ambulance vehicle, and Mr Mactier was at the local hospital with another ambulance vehicle on call, that they met at the Casino ambulance station and then proceeded in one vehicle to the Casino Police Station. They finished their treatment of the plaintiff and called ""clear"" at 1.44am, which means that they were free to attend another job from that time onwards. In essence, it tells me when they finished treating the plaintiff.

36Accordingly, after the ambulance officers left the police station, there would have been some short time in which the plaintiff would have been given his phone back, have a desultory conversation with at least one police officer, and then would have left the station. If it be correct the plaintiff was assaulted at 1.20, then one could see that he left the police station a few minutes after 1.44 and one therefore can say that the extent of any false imprisonment was approximately 30 minutes. 

37The first thing I have to say is this: I formed a favourable impression of the plaintiff and I am prepared to accept that he has done his best to tell me the truth. Clearly his memory of events was affected by what actually happened to him as well as by the fact that he was intoxicated at the time relevant events occurred. One can understand over-estimating a time and he may have felt abandoned in the police station. One can understand that he was not keeping any record of when things were happening when he was out ""partying"", being at Bernie's party and then at the RSM, and one can understand his reconstruction of events which has led to various particulars being given which were obviously incorrect. However I can accept the kernel of what the plaintiff told me, that he was pushed by a police officer, sprayed with OC spray, put into the back of a police caged truck, taken to Casino Police Station, and kept there for about a half hour, and that whilst there, he was decontaminated by Mr Stalker of the New South Wales Ambulance Service.

38In making that finding about the plaintiff's credibility I anticipate other findings about credibility which I must make concerning other persons. The plaintiff is clearly corroborated by Mr Stalker, and for reasons to which I will in due course turn, I can accept that they did treat Wayne Randall at the Casino Police Station rather than Colin Laurie. The records of the Ambulance Service are clear and there is no reason for the Ambulance Service or Mr Stalker or Mr Mactier to be in any way partisan towards the plaintiff or indeed partisan towards the police. I clearly accept the ambulance records as being accurate and the evidence of Mr Stalker, as far as it goes, has been reliable. 

39To deal with the police evidence, I should firstly deal briefly with the position of Senior Constable Opryszko. As I have already mentioned he was working alone on this occasion. On Friday, 22 April 2011, about 8.05pm a man living in Casino, reported that his daughter's friend, a 13-year-old girl, had been sexually assaulted. The allegation was penile vaginal penetration. Police attended within ten minutes. The principal attending officer was initially Alpha. At 9.30pm he was relieved by Senior Constable Opryszko who, between 9.30pm and 1.50am, guarded the crime scene where the sexual assault had taken place. Senior Constable Opryszko was joined by Sergeant Carroll of the Crime Scene Unit at 1.10am on the morning of 23 April 2011, thus causing him to leave the crime scene at 1.50am. Eventually he returned to the Casino Police Station shortly after 1.50. It is possible that he may have stopped to refill the Pajero with petrol, but that would have not taken any great time. Senior Constable Opryszko was rostered to work until 3pm and he did so. When asked if he could recall who was present when he returned to the police station, Senior Constable Opryszko was unable to remember who was there. Senior Constable Opryszko has nothing to do with the current matter and neither his conduct nor his evidence can be in any way called into question. 

40It is perhaps convenient if I deal firstly with the police case against Colin Randall. At 2am on the morning of 23 April 2011 Alpha made an entry in his police notebook when he was at Casino Police Station. The entry is this:

""St Mary's High School. Colin Randall. Failed to comply. Requested several times to leave as done on four other occasions and stated, 'No, I'm staying here'. Was going to be arrested for continuing offence then ran from police. Not sighted again. POI known and [infringement notice] to be issued for failing to comply.""

On a later shift commencing at 7.57pm on 23 April 2011 Alpha generated a COPS entry. He commenced that by giving the time and date as, ""About 0200 hours Saturday 23 April 11."" However, in his evidence Alpha admitted that the actual events occurred at about 1.20 or 1.30. In chief this evidence was given:

""A. Well, I pulled out into West Street, I noticed Colin Randall, I've spoken to Colin Randall in the past, on that where I've marked that X sitting down against the wall and I've approached Colin Randall.

Q. What time was that?
A. It would have been about 1.20.""

In cross-examination at the foot of p 49 and the top of p 50 of the transcript of 14 March 2013 Alpha said that his notebook entry was made at 2am and he estimated from the time of making the entry in the notebook that the events occurred at about 1.20, 1.30am on the morning of 23 April 2011.

41The narrative generated by Alpha in the COPS entry is this:

""On Friday 22/4/11 police closed a large 18th birthday party within Casino and as a result large groups of persons left and soon entered the Casino CBD. One of these persons being the accused, Colin Randall. Police first spoke to Randall near the Cecil Hotel, where he was abusive towards police and inciting the group to engage in arguing with the police, and also challenging police. The accused was moved on and continued walking, being told to leave the Casino CBD area and to go home. The accused was again spoken to in front of KFC Casino where he challenged police again, police telling him again to move on and leave the area or be arrested for failing to comply. Police having had to also attend to other jobs, left the area and soon returned to find the accused loitering around McDonald's carpark, only 50 metres from where he was last told to leave the area.

Police advised him again to move away from the area completely. Police followed a large group of persons behind the Casino RSM before returning to Casino McDonald's area where the Kyogle police were conducting a vehicle stop and the accused was there abusing police. He soon walked away on seeing the police. 

42Police were called to the area after officers were nearly hit by a beer can at the vehicle stop, and located the accused not far away on West Street, Casino. He was stopped and spoken to by other police and was issued with a further move-on direction and was to leave immediately. The accused then engaged in an argument with police, challenging police authority and the fact that police couldn't tell him what to do. Police expressed to the accused to leave immediately or be arrested. He said to police, 'No. I'm staying here.'

43The accused in the police views had ample opportunities to leave the area of Casino CBD several times, and police felt that the accused was testing police and the limits in which he could go to before being arrested. With the accused having total disregard for police authority and police ensuring community safety, and the accused's neglect to move on, police attempted to grab and arrest the accused, but he fled upon being grabbed. Police gave chase, but lost sight of the accused, who was still abusing police, saying, 'Fucking dogs,' whilst running away. Given the amount of times the accused was spoken to and total ignorance of the accused, police have issued the accused with a fail to comply with police direction infringement notice.""

44Exhibit V is an in-car video recording made from the Highway Patrol vehicle manned by Leading Senior Constable Nixon and Senior Constable Stewart. The Cecil Hotel is on the corner of Barker and Centre Street, Casino. Centre Street is the main street of Casino. It carries both route 91 and Highway 44. I understand it to have been renumbered the B91, that is the Summerland Way, and Highway 44 is the Bruxner Highway. Exhibit V shows police vehicles pulling up at the corner of Barker Street and Centre Street, Casino, between 12.33am and 12.35am. There was a commotion at the intersection of Barker and Centre Streets, on the corner of the intersection directly opposite the Cecil Hotel. That is obviously the commotion that is first referred to. That Colin Randall moved on can be gleaned from the fact that exhibit V shows Colin Randall walking along Centre Street at 12:39am heading north, that is away from the Cecil Hotel and in the direction of McDonald's, which is on the corner of Centre Street and Canterbury Street.

45Walking north along Centre Street from its intersection with Barker Street, the first road to be crossed is Simpson Parade. The next road to be crossed is Canterbury Street. As I said, McDonald's is on the corner of Canterbury Street and Centre Street in the south-west corner of that intersection. On the north-west corner of the Canterbury Street and Centre Street intersection is the Catholic Church. Indeed it appears from exhibit J that the Catholic Church, as an institution as distinct from a building, owns the whole, or at least most of, the block comprised of Canterbury Street to the south, Centre Street to the east, North Street to the north and West Street to the west. The southern part of the Catholic Church block comprises the church itself in the east and then the Convent of Mercy, and then St Mary's Catholic College, and on the western side are a series of buildings that has been referred to variously as the Relihan Centre. The northern side of the Catholic church block comprises St Mary's Primary School.

46It is clear that the place where the police attempted to arrest Colin Randall was in West Street near a bus bay near the Relihan Centre, and one can accordingly see a location placed on the COPS entry for the Colin Randall matter, exhibit K, a location of ""on footpath St Mary's High School"". It would therefore be only a relatively short distance from the McDonald's carpark to West Street where Colin Randall was when the police sought to arrest him.

47The narrative which I have quoted also refers to a beer can being thrown at a police vehicle. That vehicle was in fact Kyogle 23, and the place where the vehicle was when the can was thrown at it has been marked with a red ""X"" on Centre Street near the Catholic Church building itself on exhibit J. It is not known who threw the can, but Constable Beek did not seem particularly perturbed by it.

48Exhibit V, the in-car video, clearly shows some of the events that occurred in West Street. When the police sought to arrest Colin Randall, he ran away into the school yards in the Catholic Church block. Those who pursued him were Alpha, who had sought to arrest him, and Senior Constable Stewart from the Highway Patrol. Accordingly that fixes the interaction of the police with Colin Randall at about 1.20am on West Street, Casino, in the block between North Street and Canterbury Street. The plaintiff therefore attempted to expose video film on his camera of the interaction of the police and Colin Randall at about 1.20am on 23 April 2011. 

49I should indicate that Exhibit K, the COPS entry which I have quoted, gives Colin Randall's address as Boronia Crescent, Casino, and observed that he was ""well known to police"". It also describes Colin Randall, the plaintiff's brother, as being an Aboriginal, having a light brown complexion. 

50Exhibit V corroborates the arrival of a number of police vehicles in West Street where Colin Randall had his interaction with police. My notes made of the in-car video indicate the relevant events commenced at about 1.19am on 23 April 2011. Alpha's ""partner"" on this evening was Beta. His statement is exhibit R. I quote four parts of his statement:

""6. I recall that some time between the hours of 1am and 2am on Saturday the 23rd of April 2011 Alpha, myself and several other officers who I believe to be Senior Constable Stewart, Senior Constable Nixon, Gamma and Delta, were on West Street in Casino behind the St Mary's High School. Also at this location were several other persons, only one of whose identity is known to me, Colin Randall.

7. Colin Randall was near the footpath behind St Mary's High School speaking with Alpha. Several other officers, including myself, were on the middle of West Street speaking with an irate, belligerent and intoxicated male whose identity is not [known] to me, but appeared to me to be about 18 years old. I cannot remember the identity of all of the officers that were near me, but there were about three or four other officers near me, and about three other officers near Alpha, about 7 metres away from me.

8. I heard various officers repeatedly tell the male on the road to 'get back', however he continued to stand very close to police. I cannot recall which officers told this person to get back, but the words ""get back"" were repeated several times by police. This male was holding his arms out by his side and [spoke] to police with a raised voice. I cannot remember what this male was saying. 

9. I had a police issued Maglight torch in my hands and pushed this male to his chest in a 'check drill' type push. I did this to maintain a reactionary gap between myself and the male. As I was doing this another officer deployed a short burst of OC spray towards the male. Some of this OC spray made contact with my face, including my eyes. The OC spray also made contact with the male's face, and appeared to take effect almost immediately. I had minimal involvement in what happened after this point as I was washing my eyes out with saline solution.""

Exhibit R was made by Beta on 6 November 2012, 18 months after the events in question. There is a relevant entry in his police notebook, a copy of which is exhibit U. The entry is this:

""23-04-2011
1:20am
Sprayed with OC spray.""

One might think that that is a recording by Beta of the fact that at 1.20am on 23 April 2011 he was sprayed with OC spray. However, Beta tried to maintain that that was not the time when the event occurred, but the time that he recorded it in his notebook. The evidence of Beta in that regard I cannot accept. It defies logic and commonsense, and defies other objective evidence, and is inconsistent with the evidence of Alpha as to timing. The important point, however, is that there is no doubt that Beta was the collateral damage to the application of OC spray at about 1.20am on a male person in West Street, Casino. 

LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT

51HIS HONOUR: Before moving on to another topic, I should point this out: the effect of the plaintiff's evidence was that he attended the RSM Club with his cousin, Joshua Harvey, and his brother, Colin Randall, and was then walking with his brother towards the place where he was staying that night near the Casino Railway Station with one of his aunts. There was no cross-examination of the plaintiff directed to the absence of his brother from the plaintiff's company as recordered in exhibit K, that is, his brother's being near the Cecil Hotel at about 12.35am, or walking towards the McDonald's carpark later on that night. Nor was it ever suggested to the plaintiff that he was in his brother's company at the Cecil Hotel or near the Cecil Hotel, or in any place other than a route between the RSM Club and where he was to stay on the evening in question. 

52I also point out that assuming that the person that Beta described as ""an irate, belligerent and intoxicated male"" who was about 18 years old and was the person pushed by Beta with a ""check drill"" type push before the deployment of OC spray, was the plaintiff, the plaintiff was not cross-examined about this alleged interaction with Beta. Furthermore, the plaintiff was not cross-examined to suggest that he was told by officers to ""get back"", nor was he cross-examined to suggest that he was holding out his hands by his side, which of course would be inconsistent with the plaintiff's holding a mobile phone used as a video camera in front of his face with his two hands. That is a significant flaw in the presentation of the defendant's case, but perhaps counsel was forced not to cross-examine on that basis because of other instructions which he had.

53There is another piece of evidence to suggest the plaintiff's interaction with police in West Street, Casino, was at about 1.20am on 23 April 2011. That is an entry in the notebook of Delta which records that at 1.20 on 23 April 2011 in West Street at its intersection with Canterbury Street there was the plaintiff, whose date of birth is given, and whose address in South Grafton is given, and whose mobile phone number is given, but is put in as ""a record only"". That clearly placed the plaintiff at 1.20am in West Street, Casino.

54It is now important to go back to earlier events. Exhibit S is a CIDS message. It represents a message broadcast over the police radio. The informant is given as ""T J Butler"". Whether that person is male or female I do not know. The complaint was that between 100 and 200 people were fighting. The location of this brawl was in the street after the train bridge, Hotham Street, Casino. The message was broadcast at 11.48pm on Friday, 22 April 2011. Police vehicles sent to attend were Casino 21, Casino 38, Kyogle 23 and the Highway Patrol vehicle. That represents all the police resources available in Casino with the exception of Senior Constable Opryszko. Exhibit S is cross-referenced to COPS entry E14436697. That COPS entry is exhibit 7. This COPS entry was commenced by Delta at 4.19am on 23 April 2011. The narrative is this:

""About 11.40pm on Friday, the 22nd of April 2011, police have been called to a large group of intoxicated persons yelling and attempting to start fights in Hotham Street, Casino.

Police have attended the [location] and found the group of persons all having come from the party at 94 Canterbury Street. 

Police have once again moved the group on.""

It is clear that the principal response vehicle to this broadcast about a brawl was Casino 21. The inference to be drawn is that the party at 94 Canterbury Street was the same large 18th birthday party that was referred to at the commencement of the narrative in exhibit K. One can see therefore a large number of young people in the streets of Casino after the 18th birthday party had been shut down. 

55Exhibit W is another CIDS message generated at 12.31am on 23 April 2011. The informant is Casino 21, meaning Delta and Gamma. The broadcast was about another brawl. The mobiles responding were, in addition to Casino 21, Casino 38 and Kyogle 23. However, it became clear from exhibit V, the in-car video, that the Highway patrol vehicle also attended. The CIDS message generated at 12.31am is cross-referenced to COPS entry E44438766 about which I shall have more to say shortly.

56My notes of the in-car video which is exhibit V commence with events starting at 00:33:35. They show a police caged vehicle, Casino 21, parked at a 45 degree angle on the left-hand side of Barker Street. At 00:33:47 Gamma is shown on the footpath following a group of young people walking east, that is down Barker Street towards its intersection with Centre Street. At 00:34:06 another caged vehicle comes up to the pedestrian crossing across Barker Street and parks on it. That was Kyogle 23. At 00:34:15 one can see Constable Beek alighting from the passenger side of Kyogle 23. At 00:34:23 Senior Constable McCormack alights from the driver's side of Kyogle 23 and runs in front of the vehicle and follows Constable Beek at a jog. Constable Beek had been heading eastward towards the intersection of Barker Street and Centre Street. At 00:34:38 one can see Senior Constable McCormack drawing his OC spray and shaking it. He gave evidence that he did not use it on this evening, and I have no reason not to accept his statement to that effect.

57At 00:34:53 Casino 38, the sedan occupied by Alpha and Beta, comes into view. At 00:35:10 one sees a young male person under arrest. The age of the person I cannot discern from the film, but the person is clearly under the age of 30. He is wearing shoes, a white T-shirt and shorts. He is handcuffed. At 00:35:13 a door to the caged truck of Kyogle 23 is opened and at 00:35:20 the person who had been handcuffed was pushed inside the caged truck. Those escorting the arrested person are Senior Constable Stewart and Gamma. At 00:35:23 Senior Constable Stewart gave the thumbs up and one second later the door of the caged truck was shut. Eventually, both Casino 21 and Kyogle 23 moved out of Barker Street and turned left into Centre Street. At 00:38:57, one can see a transfer of the person who had been placed in the rear of Kyogle 23 into the rear of Casino 21. One caged truck pulled up beside the other and the prisoner was transferred from Kyogle 23 to Casino 21. As that was occurring, the Highway Patrol vehicle pulled out from behind the caged trucks and travelled north along Centre Street. What Casino 21 did then is not the subject of any contemporaneous or objective evidence. 

58At 1:52:23 on 23 April 2011, a phone call was made to 000 and was answered by the Ambulance Service. The call appears to have been answered at 1:56:31. The informant was Mr Hayden Simpson, and his address was given. The record makes it clear that the 000 call was made from a public telephone. The gist of the message, from the computer generated records in exhibit N, gives a location opposite the Casino High School near the shops and indicates that the informant said that the police had sprayed the patient in the eye and then left. The handwritten ambulance records concerning this attendance show a booking time of 1.53am, completely consistent with the computer generated record of the Ambulance Service.

59The handwritten records show that the ambulance vehicle arrived at the scene at 2.06am and had contact with the patient at the same time. The place of contact was outside the garage on Queensland Road, Casino. The patient is said to be Colin Laurie, but the Christian name has been spelt with two ""l""s rather than one, and the final ""e"" of Laurie has been omitted. Like Mr Randall's name in the other ambulance record I have mentioned, there is a misspelling of names. Indeed, the document itself suggests that the person who completed the ambulance record concerning Wayne Randall was the same person who generated the record concerning Colin Laurie. In fact, it was the same two ambulance officers who attended to this call: Mr Mactier and Mr Stalker. It would appear that on this occasion, as on the earlier occasion, Mr Mactier filled out the patient details and Mr Stalker did the treatment. The ambulance record gives Mr Colin Laurie's date of birth, 23 December 1995, which is known to be Colin Laurie's date of birth, his correct age at the time, 15 years, and gives an address at Maxwell Street, Grafton, not an address in Casino.

60The narrative contained in the handwritten record is ""capsicum spray/intoxication"". The narrative then records a male patient with sore eyes. The patient stated that he was earlier sprayed with OC spray by the police. The narrative records that the patient was decontaminated at the scene, and the patient then stated that he just wanted to go home. The ambulance officers called in clear at 2.18am, meaning that they were with Mr Laurie from 2.06 to 2.18am, a period of some 12 minutes.

61The first thing to note is that Casino High School is on a road which bears one of two titles: Queensland Road and Summerland Way. A red ""X"" marked on Summerland Way on exhibit O represents the Casino High School site. That was placed there by Delta. The ""X"" marked on exhibit O is not far from the place where Boronia Crescent, Casino, is. One can infer from the fact that where Colin Laurie was that he was heading towards Boronia Crescent, the home of one of his aunts. Why he was not then at home is not known on any objective basis.

62Not only did the Ambulance Service respond to the request by Hayden Simpson for the an ambulance to treat his friend or acquaintance, Colin Laurie, but the Ambulance Service also advised police of the complaint which had been made by Hayden Simpson to the Ambulance Service. The computer-generated ambulance records indicate notification to the police at 1:59:49 on 23 April 2011. The advice by the Ambulance Service generated another CIDS message. That message is exhibit M. It was generated at 2.01am on 23 April 2011. The message is this:

""Hayden Simpson claims police sprayed 15-year-old friend with capsicum spray and left the scene - persons now requesting ambos. Informant contact number"" -

and then is given a mobile phone number. That mobile phone number I cannot find in the ambulance records, exhibit N, at all. However, one might think that mobile telephone numbers might be available to the Police Force. In any event the evidence discloses that after the broadcast of that message Alpha phoned Hayden Simpson and was advised that the name of the person claiming to have been sprayed with capsicum spray was in fact Colin Laurie.

63At 4.25am on 23 April 2011 Gamma commenced a COPS entry. The COPS entry is E44438766. That is the same COPS entry cross-referenced in CIDS message generated at 12:31am on 23 April 2011 which is exhibit W, and to which I have earlier referred, before passing on to refer to what is shown on exhibit V, the police in-car video. The narrative generated by Gamma is this:

""About 1am on Saturday, 23 April 2011, police were attending a brawl at the corner of Barker and West Street, Casino. When police arrived a large group were walking east on Barker Street.

Police told the group to keep moving on, however the group continued to swear and yell at police. The POI Laurie was talking in the group when he started to yell out loud, 'Fuck you, you cunts.' 

Police grabbed the POI and told him to face the wall. The POI turned on police and tried to push police away and run. Police were able to hold onto the POI, however he continued to struggle and break free from police grasp.

Police released a one-second burst of OC spray to subdue the POI and give police enough time to handcuff the POI. Police then had to control friends of the POI who decided to get involved in the situation.

The POI was conveyed back to Casino Police Station where he was decontaminated from the affects [sic] of OC. At this time the POI was asked for his name and age. The POI stated that he was from South Grafton and was staying at his aunty's house at Boronia Crescent, Casino. Police conveyed the POI to Boronia Crescent, Casino, where he was left in the care of his aunty. 

A short time later police received a call from the Ambulance that a young person called them in relation to feeling the affects [sic] of OC spray. Police believe the POI walked in the front door and walked out the back heading back towards town.

The POI is only 15 years old and was well affected by alcohol. Police made patrols of the area for the POI but he could not be seen.""

According to evidence given by Delta, Casino 21 went out searching for Colin Laurie between 3.40am and 3.45am on 23 April 2011, but were unable to find him. Why they made no inquiry at Boronia Crescent is curious. Exhibit E, the COPS entry generated by Gamma at 4.25am on 23 April 2011, indicates that Casino 21 responded at 12.31am on 23 April, for 10 minutes, and that there was a further attendance between 1.00 and 1.30am on 23 April 2011, when the actual powers used were a ""move on"" and the further classification was, ""Refused direction, intoxicated person.""

64There is no record in any police notebook for Colin Laurie on 22 or 23 April 2011. There is no record whatever of Colin Laurie at the Casino Police Station. The only record which exists to nominate Colin Laurie, as far as the police records are concerned, is exhibit E, one generated at 4.25am on 23 April, a long time after the CIDS message was broadcast at 2.01am on the same morning.

65Clearly, the referencing of exhibit E, this COPS entry, to the CIDS message, created at 12.31am on 23 April 2011, would indicate that the person shown in the in car video as having been arrested at 12.35am, was in fact Colin Laurie. In exhibit E, it is clearly admitted that Colin Laurie was sprayed with OC spray. The police then go on to say that they took him to Casino Police Station and decontaminated him themselves. However, the ambulance officers found Colin Laurie undecontaminated at 2.06am on Queensland Road near the Casino High School. 

66Inconsistent with what is contained in exhibit E, certain members of the New South Wales Police in these proceedings have sought to maintain that Colin Laurie was attended to, not by them at the Casino Police Station, but by members of the Ambulance Service, and that that the person decontaminated at the police station was Colin Laurie or the plaintiff pretending to be Colin Laurie but not the plaintiff in his own name.

67The flaw in any such reconstruction is that it creates too many inconsistencies and implausibilities. The biggest implausibility is this: I know that at 1.32am, Mr Mactier and Mr Stalker, and in particular Mr Stalker, treated a person identified as Wayne Randall aged 20, at the Casino Police Station. Necessarily, decontaminating someone for the effects of OC spray in the face and in particular the eyes would require the treating ambulance officer to be ""up close and personal"" with the patient. One would think he would have to look the patient in the eyes to make sure that there was nothing more sinister than some irritation from OC spray. I know that the same two ambulance officers attended upon a person identified as Colin Laurie, aged 15, at 2.06am, 34 minutes later. Certain police want me to believe that these two people are in fact the same person, and that Mr Mactier and Mr Stalker, both seasoned, experienced ambulance officers, could not tell that one person they treated was the same as the person they treated 34 minutes later. That is implausible in the extreme. Furthermore, it postulates that an experienced, seasoned ambulance officer could not tell the difference between a 15-year-old youth and a 20-year-old man. That is equally implausible. Such implausibilities are scoffed at by learned counsel for the defendant, but with the utmost respect, he must live in a different world to me. 

68One would think that if the two persons treated by the ambulance officers were one and the same they would note it because they would be concerned that their earlier ministrations to the patient had failed their purpose. They might also be concerned that a patient had been sprayed with OC spray a second time. True it is that Mr Stalker did not give evidence about that but that is explicable by the fact that at the time he gave evidence, 12 March 2013, no-one had available to him the ambulance records relating to Colin Laurie. One will note in the transcript, and from what is contained in exhibit N, that on the afternoon of Wednesday, 13 March 2013, I granted leave to the plaintiff to issue a subpoena for production addressed to the Ambulance Service of New South Wales requiring the production of any record relating to the treatment of Colin Laurie, date of birth 23 December 1995, at Casino on 22 April 2011, and 23 April 2011, and any record of any call or calls made to the Ambulance Service of New South Wales by or on behalf of any member of the New South Wales Police for the attendance of any ambulance or ambulance officer at Casino Police Station between 11pm on 22 April 2011 and 3am on 28 April 2011. I directed the subpoena be served by facsimile transmission by 11am on 14 March 2013. I abridged time for the return of the subpoena, made the subpoena returnable at 10am on Friday, 15 March 2013, and directed the subpoena might be obeyed by sending the documents by facsimile transmission to the Coffs Harbour Court House. In fact the Ambulance Service was kind enough to send the documents by facsimile transmission to the Court House at 9.31am on Thursday, 14 March 2013, and they were then produced to counsel and the matter then continued. 

69In his evidence, Gamma said that around 1.25 to 1.30, in between those two times, on the morning of 23 April 2011, he arrested a person named Colin Laurie. He said that later on, that is at some time after the arrest, he found out that Colin Laurie was 15. He then said that they took him back to the station and he looked him up in the police computer system and that brought up his details. In other words, merely by having a person's name, one can find out his details from pre-existing police records. I offer the observation that one does not need to have the physical body of the person in the police station to make that inquiry. One needs only to have the person's name. He also said that there was no other person at the police station when Colin Laurie was there. He said that there was no custody manager at Casino on the night of 22 and 23 April, as the senior officer was Senior Constable Opryszko who was guarding the crime scene.

70He also said that Colin Laurie was arrested in West Street near St Mary's High School. He mentioned that there were other vehicles in attendance; Kyogle 23 and Casino 38. Gamma also said that Delta decontaminated Colin Laurie at Casino Police Station. That of course is consistent with exhibit E. However, he went on to say that the ambulance officers turned up at the Casino Police Station when Colin Laurie was there. He went on to say this:

""Q. What did they do when they arrived?
A. They attempted to give treatment to the person I know as Colin Laurie in the dock with the door open, he abused them and at that stage they refused treatment.

Q. When you say he abused them, what do you mean?
A. He told them to 'Fuck off.'

Q. Did anything happen?
A. No, the ambulance officers refused to treat him.

Q. And took his advice and they left?
A. Yes.""

The witness was then shown the COPS entry and acknowledged that he created the document. I would point out that there was no mention in exhibit E of any turning up at the police station by ambulance officers to treat Colin Laurie, nor is there any statement in exhibit E to suggest that the ambulance officers refused to treat Colin Laurie because Colin Laurie would not cooperate with them.

71Gamma went on to give evidence that he and Delta made arrangements to take Colin Laurie back to his aunty's place. He also went on to say that he called for an ambulance only once and not twice. Gamma said that only one person was sprayed with OC spray at St Mary's School, and that Beta got a secondary spray, but the person sprayed was Colin Laurie. Gamma could not tell me who sprayed capsicum spray on Colin Laurie, but Delta told me that it was in fact Gamma.

72In cross-examination, Gamma told me that the ambulance was called for by car radio at 1.23am when the Casino 21 was still in West Street with Colin Laurie in the back of the truck. He also said that before he and Delta left the Casino Police Station to take Colin Laurie back to Boronia Crescent, Alpha had turned up at the police station. In Gamma's estimate, Colin Laurie was at the police station for about ten to fifteen minutes. 

73Alpha gave evidence that when he returned to the police station at 2am there was a small Aboriginal male in custody. However, Alpha did not see his face. Alpha went on to refer to that small Aboriginal male as ""the young chap"" who was bending over the basin being decontaminated for OC spray. Learned counsel for the defendant was quick to seize on his ""young chap"" because he then commenced a question ""This young person..."" which, of course, has a meaning in law much more technical than ""the young chap"". 

74In cross-examination Alpha said that he heard Delta and Gamma leave Casino Police Station five or ten minutes after he arrived at 2 o'clock because he heard them leaving the side door. He had them leaving the side door at 2.05 or 2.10, or somewhere in between. This evidence cannot be true because at 2.06 the ambulance officers were treating Colin Laurie outside the garage on Queensland Road near the Casino High School. 

75If it were true it would mean that Colin Laurie had been in police custody from thirty-five minutes after midnight to after 2am with no record being generated whatever, with no contact with the minor's parent or guardian, with no contact with the appropriate Aboriginal liaison officer, with no contact with Juvenile Justice, and no contact with any superior officer such as the duty officer at Lismore. Alpha would have been accompanied by his partner for the evening, Beta, but Beta in his evidence could not recall if there was anybody in the police station in custody when he returned with Alpha at 2am. 

76I am completely unable to accept the evidence of Alpha that he saw a small Aboriginal male who might have been 15 when he returned to the Casino Police Station at 2am. It is, in my view, evidence invented to assist the case being mounted by Gamma and Delta. Gamma and Delta both want me to find that the person whom the ambulance people attended to at Casino Police Station was Colin Laurie rather than Wayne Randall. I reject that evidence in its entirety. Although I don't need to formally find so, there is much strength in the submission to me on behalf of the plaintiff that exhibit E, the COPS event generated concerning Colin Laurie on 4.25am on 23 April 2011, was generated only to try to remedy the mischief caused by the CIDS message of 2.01am on 23 April 2011. 

77However, in order to try to cover up the ""mischief"" caused by the current plaintiff's complaint, Gamma and Delta appear to want me to believe that the plaintiff was pretending to be Colin Laurie, or that Colin Laurie was the person treated by the ambulance officers at 1.34, and that the plaintiff is merely riding on Colin Laurie's coat-tails in order to make a substantial sum of money out of something that never occurred. I am afraid the probabilities are that Delta and Gamma have tried to cover up their misconduct by making assertions on oath which are false and mischievous, to say the least. 

78The evidence of Delta is similar in many respects to the evidence of Gamma. Delta also gave evidence that ambulance officers attended at the Casino Police Station whilst Colin Laurie was present. Delta says that he admitted the ambulance officers to the charge room. He identified one ambulance officer as Mr Stalker. He, like Gamma, said that Colin Laurie refused treatment. Delta, like Gamma, said that there was no-one else at the station at the time Colin Laurie was there and that there was no-one else in custody, seeking thereby to make it impossible for the plaintiff to have been at the police station at the time that they would have me believe Colin Laurie was arrested.

79When cross-examined about his notebook entry, to which I made reference much earlier in these reasons, Delta said that Wayne Randall was in a group of about 20 people and he had interaction with Wayne Randall at 1.20am. Besides his wanting to move all those persons on, Delta did not take the details of any person who failed to move on other than those of the current plaintiff. I found that evidence strange, especially when bearing in mind the plaintiff's allegations, one can understand a person such as Delta recording details of the plaintiff in his notebook if he was to be arrested, taken to the station, and decontaminated after being sprayed with OC spray. The fact is that although the details of the plaintiff are recorded, no reason at all is given in the notebook for why the plaintiff's details were recorded. That, in my view, itself is somewhat suspicious. One would think if one were recording details of a putative offender in a police notebook one would at least want to record there why the record was being made. That is commonsense. I am afraid that I cannot accept the evidence of either Gamma or Delta. 

80I have already made criticism of part of the evidence of Alpha and part of the evidence of Beta. I make no criticism of any other police witness but I do thank Leading Senior Constable Stephen Nixon whose evidence, and the in-car video which he brought to court, has greatly assisted me. I have no hesitation in finding that the person arrested by Gamma and Senior Constable Stewart at 12.35am on 23 April 2011 was in fact Colin Laurie. I have no hesitation finding that he had been sprayed with OC spray by Gamma. I have no hesitation finding that eventually he was placed in Casino 21. What happened to him thereafter is not recorded in any contemporaneous document. I do know where he was found by ambulance officers complaining about not having been decontaminated after having been sprayed by OC spray. It is of course possible that he was taken back to the Casino Police Station. An attempt may have been made by police, namely Gamma and Delta, to decontaminate him there, and then perhaps they took him towards his ""home"" address, that is, Boronia Crescent. However he had not reached that place which he referred to when speaking to the ambulance officers as ""home"" when the ambulance officers attended upon him at 2.06am to decontaminate him. It seems to me more likely that Casino 21 merely dropped Colin Laurie off somewhere and hoped that he would not create any mischief. Mischief was caused by the CIDS message generated at 2.01am. 

81I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the evidence of Gamma and Delta is not to be accepted at all and that the plaintiff was pushed and sprayed with OC spray by either Gamma or Delta at about 1.20am, then placed by them in the back of Casino 21 and taken to the Casino Police Station where he was imprisoned in a cell and kept there until the arrival of ambulance officers, Mr Stalker and Mr Mactier, who decontaminated him. I accept that the plaintiff was released from custody shortly after 1.44pm, after about half an hour in custody. 

82Bearing in mind what the plaintiff told me about his mobile phone, I accept what prompted the intervention by Gamma and Delta was the attempt by the plaintiff to film the interaction of other police with Colin Randall and that caused Delta and Gamma to deal with the plaintiff in the way they did. Spraying the plaintiff with OC spray caused him to drop his mobile camera. They took it, erased video footage on it, and then returned it to him so that no untoward film could later be displayed in court of any police interaction with his brother, Colin Randall. In other words, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities the plaintiff has made out his case for the torts of assault and false imprisonment. 

83Much time was spent in dealing with submissions made about the rule in Browne v Dunn. That is a rule of fairness. That requires a party to put to a witness such evidence as the party has that would indicate that their evidence not be believed, or to put to the witness matters which will be used against him. Such matters cannot be put unless one knows what the material one has is. Here the evidence was introduced in such a piecemeal fashion that no-one at the close of the plaintiff's case had any idea what was to be said in the defendant's case. I wholly suspect that learned counsel for the defendant was in much the same position as his learned opponents at that time. In any event I am persuaded by the address of Mr Steirn, which has been recorded, that it was fairly put to witnesses that their evidence was not to be accepted. In fact, I put on one occasion to Delta that he was not telling the truth, so blatant did it become. Much was also said in submissions about the failure to call Colin Laurie. When one looks at it analytically, the party that should have called Colin Laurie was not the plaintiff but the defendant. Colin Laurie had nothing to do with the plaintiff's case. The plaintiff maintained that it was he and not Colin Laurie who was sprayed with OC spray and taken to the police station. If the defendant wanted to say that that was what happened to Colin Laurie and Colin Laurie was in the police station when the plaintiff says he was in the police station, the defendant should have called Colin Laurie but did not. As I put in the course of argument there is no property in a witness. 

84I have inquired of counsel for the parties whether they need any further reasons for judgment on liability. I am told that they do not. I intend to take a short adjournment and then I will come back and deal with damages. 

SHORT ADJOURNMENT

85HIS HONOUR: I turn now to an assessment of the plaintiff's damages. The plaintiff has specifically eschewed an award of damages for personal injury. I can understand the legislative provisions which decided the plaintiff to make that election. However, actions for assault and false imprisonment are both actions in trespass and are actionable without proof of any damage.

86I have carefully taken into consideration the principles applicable to the award of damages in a case of this nature, in particular what fell from Basten JA in State of New South Wales v Delly [2007] NSWCA 303; (2007) 70 NSWLR 125 at [104] to [118]. I have also taken into account what fell from Tobias AJA in State of New South Wales v Quirk [2012] NSWCA 216 between [148] and [164].

87Here what is described as the ""first assault"" in the statement of claim, a pushing backwards, was only minor. The spraying of the capsicum spray into the plaintiff's face is much more serious. It rendered him temporarily unable to see much, if anything, for a period of at least quarter of an hour. It was in contumelious disregard of his liberty, it was in contumelious disregard of his person, and of his dignity. It was a personal affront.

88The use of an agent such as capsicum spray is, in my view, equivalent to the use of an implement to carry out the assault, such as a weapon, such as a club, piece of wood, baseball bat or the like that are often used in assaults. It clearly interfered with the plaintiff's personal dignity and with his safety. He was assaulted in a public place where there were no doubt others present, as the evidence clearly attests. That is a further insult to the person.

89Much time was spent yesterday considering other cases where similar issues have arisen. Every case, of course is, different. Here we have a young man who was assaulted in the early hours of a Saturday morning when he was trying to make his way from licensed premises to his temporary place of abode in Casino, where he had come to do something which was not unlawful, to expose video film of police interacting with his brother, no doubt in the expectation that he might assist his brother if his brother got into any difficulty. The reason for the assault clearly was to get hold of the plaintiff's mobile telephone/video camera so that any untoward footage could be removed by the police. The motive for the assault is not rage, but self-interest. Doing the best I can, I award $20,000 to the plaintiff for aggravated compensatory damages for the assault. 

90For the false imprisonment I must bear in mind what fell from Bryson JA in Zaravinos v State of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 320; (2004) 62 NSWLR 58 at [52]:

""Damages are not capable of being related proportionately to the length of the period of detention, and 'a substantial proportion of the ultimate award must be given for what has been described as 'the initial shock of being arrested'': Ruddock v Taylor [2003] NSWCA 262 per Spigelman CJ at [49]. That substantial proportion of the ultimate award of damages could not vary to whether the detention was for about two and three-quarter hours or for about three and a half hours.""

However, I must bear in mind here that the period of detention was short, about half an hour, but the plaintiff was left, no doubt, confused, demoralised, angry, upset, bewildered and no doubt frightened by what had happened to him. I say frightened because he had been assaulted by the police once, was in their power or control and could harbour in his mind a fear of further indignities being heaped upon him. Doing the best I can, I assess the plaintiff's damages for false imprisonment, being aggravated damages, in the sum of $15,000.

In this case I am persuaded that exemplary damages are appropriate. The Court must condemn the conduct of Delta and Gamma in seeking to hide what they did from the time it occurred right up until giving evidence and in fact persisting with that in the defence of this case which continued until I commenced these reasons for judgment earlier today. As has been submitted by Mr Steirn, QC for the plaintiff, what the police did was calculated, cold-blooded and cynical, in complete disregard of the plaintiff's human rights, and done for the purpose of making sure that any video film exposed by the plaintiff would not cause police officers some grief in the future. The attempt to hide what had happened is to be condemned. All members of our community expect that due process will occur. In the current case, due process did not occur. The plaintiff was not processed as he ought to have been done after he was arrested, and the police, because of their continued denial of doing what they did, offer no explanation for why they arrested the plaintiff. The only reason for the arrest which the evidence allows me to find is that the plaintiff wanted to video the interaction of his brother and the police and the police did not want that to occur. 

91In an earlier case, decided over a half decade ago, it was suggested that the maximum amount payable for punitive damages in a similar sort of case was $25,000. Times move on and we move on with them. I have determined that the appropriate amount of exemplary or punitive damages to award against the defendant in respect of both the causes of action - not in respect of each but in respect of both - is a sum of $30,000. If my mathematics be correct, the total of those sums is $65,000.

92If any further explanation be needed for the award of exemplary damages it is this. The rule of law is the bedrock of our society, the basis of our democracy and our civil and political rights. When those who are sworn to uphold the rule of law flout it, damage is done. A citizen looks to a constable of police to use his powers to protect that citizen's rights. When a constable of police misuses his powers to infringe the citizen's rights, the confidence of that citizen in the rule of law is shaken. The citizen can become cynical. His trust is the constabulary is lessened. The prestige of the constabulary is impaired. It is important that the Court demonstrate its purpose to uphold the rule of law and the integrity of our institutions. 

SUBMISSIONS REGARDING INTEREST

93HIS HONOUR: I feel some of sympathy for the State which must bear punitive damages, although they are essentially being awarded for the conduct of Gamma and Delta. However, the State has a duty to ensure that police officers do carry out their office according to law and not according to whim. It is unfortunate that no senior officer, some commissioned officer or even a sergeant, was available in Casino on the weekend in question. That may have caused better behaviour on the part of Gamma and Delta. 

FURTHER SUBMISSIONS

94Counsel now agree that the plaintiff is entitled to some interest on some part of the plaintiff's damages. The aggravated compensatory damages which I have awarded amount to $35,000. Both parties agree that it is appropriate that I award interest on half that sum from 23 April 2011. After the usual protracted period of discussion, counsel are now agreed that the interest payable on $17,500 from 23 April 2011 to date is $3563. For those reasons I give verdict in judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant for $68,563. I order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's costs. I recommend to the taxing officer that the plaintiff's costs include fees for both senior and junior counsel. 

SUBMISSIONS REGARDING COSTS

95HIS HONOUR: Liberty to apply on the question of costs within seven days. Notice to be given to my Associate so that we can make a further listing if it's to be argued.

2705780,Stanizzo v Complainant [2013] NSWCCA 295,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2LATHAM J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
3R A HULME J:  This is an application for leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against an order made in the District Court awarding costs to the respondent upon the setting aside of a subpoena issued on behalf of the applicant.
4The applicant was the accused in criminal proceedings pending in the District Court at Sydney.  The respondent was the complainant.  As the offences included prescribed sexual assault offences nothing may be published that would identify her.  Accordingly she is referred to by way of pseudonym in these proceedings.
5The applicant requires an extension of time.  The delay in filing the application was not gross and, although the explanation advanced by Mr Waterstreet of counsel was not entirely satisfactory, the granting of an extension was not opposed and in my view should be granted.
Proceedings in the District Court
6A subpoena was issued on behalf of the applicant on 20 December 2012.  It was returnable at 2pm on 24 January 2013 in the District Court at the Downing Centre, Sydney.  It was directed to the respondent and called for the production of a wide variety of documents.  The solicitors for the respondent filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the subpoena be set aside.  It was returnable in the District Court at the Downing Centre at 10am on 24 January 2013.
7On 24 January 2013, the motion came before his Honour Judge Solomon.  There was an appearance by counsel for the respondent but no appearance for the applicant.  The matter was stood in the list and when his Honour came back to the matter there was still no appearance by or for the applicant.  His Honour then ordered that the subpoena be set aside.  Counsel for the respondent made an application for costs.  His Honour granted that application and ordered that the applicant pay the respondent's costs in the sum of $2365.  
8The solicitors for the applicant then filed a notice of motion seeking an order that the orders made on 24 January 2013 be set aside.  That motion also came before his Honour Judge Solomon on 11 February 2013.  His Honour concluded that he had no power to deal with it as the validity of the order that he made on 24 January 2013 was a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal.
9A notice of application for leave to appeal was filed in this Court on 11 March 2013.  
Issue on the application
10The proceedings involve a single issue:  does the District Court in its criminal jurisdiction have power to make an order for costs to a successful applicant for the setting aside of a subpoena?
Determination
11It was common ground, and I accept, that the District Court, as an inferior statutory court, has no inherent jurisdiction.  It has only such powers as are expressly conferred upon it or as are necessarily implied from the express conferral of jurisdiction (the latter most commonly referred to as ""implied"" jurisdiction):  John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 at [24]; [28] per Spigelman CJ.  The Chief Justice spoke (at [35]) of the question of whether a matter is within the implied jurisdiction being determined by a test of necessity and he referred (at [37]) to authority for the proposition that this test is a strict one.  
12It was also common ground, and I accept, that there is no express conferral on the District Court of a power to order costs in criminal proceedings as a consequence of the setting aside of a subpoena.  Indeed the circumstances in which costs can be awarded in criminal proceedings in the District Court are significantly limited in accordance with the provisions of the District Court Act 1973 (NSW) and the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW).  Accordingly it is necessary to determine the question whether a power to order costs upon the setting aside of a subpoena can be implied by a strict test of necessity.  
13In R v Mosely (1992) 28 NSWLR 735, it was not only confirmed that there was no express power for the District Court exercising its criminal jurisdiction to make an order for costs but it was also held that there was no implied power to do so.  Gleeson CJ reviewed the common law which had long held that there was a general rule that orders for costs are not made in criminal proceedings (at 738-739).  
14In Mosely, a District Court judge had purported to apply s 6 of the District Court Act which authorised the making of orders or directions or granting leave to do something ""on such terms and conditions (if any) as the Court thinks fit"".  The judge granted the Crown an adjournment of a criminal trial but ordered that it pay the costs of the accused.  This Court held that this was done in excess of jurisdiction.  
15In DPP v Deeks (1994) 34 NSWLR 523, Kirby P reviewed statutory and common law sources on the subject of whether the District Court had the power to make orders for costs in its criminal jurisdiction and concluded (at 533):
""[N]o general power exists in the District Court to make an order imposing on the Crown (or its manifestation the DPP) or, for that matter, on the accused or any other person an obligation to pay professional costs.""
16Later, his Honour further observed (at 534) that there was a:
""... strong pre-supposition of the law of this country, based upon long history, that the power to award costs in criminal proceedings must, if it is to exist, be very clearly conferred.""
17The high point of the submissions for the respondent in favour of there being an implied power to make an order for costs in the circumstances pertaining to this case was the reference to Darcy v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic [1983] 2 NSWLR 497, a decision of Hunt J (as he then was) sitting as a single judge in the Common Law Division.  In that case it was held that a magistrate had a power to make an order for costs upon the setting aside of a subpoena.  
18The problem for the respondent is that that single judge decision has been overtaken by the decisions in Mosely and Deeks and for that reason should not be followed.
Conclusion
19In the light of the two decisions of the Court of Appeal referred to above, the outcome of the present application is clear.  There was no power available to his Honour Judge Solomon to make the order for costs in favour of the respondent when he granted her application on 24 January 2013 to set aside the applicant's subpoena.  Accordingly I propose the following orders:
1. Extension of time to file notice of application for leave to appeal granted.
 2. Leave to appeal granted.
3. The order for costs made in the District Court on 24 January 2013 is quashed.

2705783,Opacic v R [2013] NSWCCA 294,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2LATHAM J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

3R A HULME J: Robert Orlando Opacic (""the applicant"") applies for leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour Judge Solomon in the District Court at Sydney on 5 October 2012.

4The applicant had pleaded guilty to two offences. One was aggravated impersonation of a police officer, contrary to s 546D(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. The offence is aggravated where the offender has an intention to deceive and purports to exercise the powers and functions of a police officer. The other offence was indecent assault which is contrary to s 61L of the Crimes Act and has prescribed for it a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.

5For the impersonation of a police officer the judge imposed a sentence of 2 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months and for the indecent assault there was a sentence of 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months. The second sentence was accumulated by 6 months upon the first sentence so that the total effective sentence was one of 3 years with a minimum custodial component of 1 year 9 months commencing 4 October 2012. Parole release arises upon the expiration of the second non-parole period on 3 July 2014.

Facts

6According to a statement of agreed facts, on the night of 21 December 2010 the victim, ND, was working as a prostitute in Bourke Street near the corner of William Street, Darlinghurst. She noticed a car that drove past her on about four occasions. Eventually it stopped and its driver, the applicant, negotiated a price for sex. He then drove away but returned. There was some further conversation about sex before the applicant said, ""Honey, I'm a police officer, you're in quite a bit of trouble and I suggest you sit in the car for a chat"". ND complied. She was too frightened to ask to see a badge or any police identification but believed that he was who he said he was. The applicant then told her he was going to issue a $500 on the spot fine and that she would also be taken to court and be given another fine of $1000. 

7ND had a Scottish accent. The applicant asked her what type of visa she had and she replied that it was a working holiday visa. He told her that her visa would probably be cancelled and she would be deported. She was shaking and was scared and said she did not want that.

8The applicant asked ND for identification and she provided a Scottish provisional driver's licence. He questioned whether it was hers and said he would be really annoyed if she was lying to him.

9The applicant then drove off, telling ND that he was taking her to the police station. She recognised that the car was driven through the Surry Hills area but after that she became lost. The conversation during the journey included the following:

Applicant: Is there anything you would do so you won't be in trouble?

ND: I don't understand.

Applicant: Have a think. What would you do to make this go away?

ND: I would do anything but I don't know what you are getting at.

Applicant: What about if you give me favours, just me, whenever I want?

ND: If I agree to that it will just get me into more trouble.

Applicant: No, it will just be between us.

10At the applicant's request there was an exchange of phone numbers. He then asked her, ""Would I be able to use this number whenever I wanted so you would be at my beck and call when I want favours?"" ND understood ""favours"" to be a reference to providing sexual services for no charge. She was non-committal in response and he replied, ""Think about it and you can make all this go away"".

11A short time later the applicant stopped and parked the car. ND did not know where they were but later identified the place as Heffron Park in the eastern Sydney suburb of Hillsdale, about 10 kilometres from the point where the journey had begun. The car was parked in the car park for the Matraville Tennis, Squash and Indoor Cricket Centre. 

12ND was wearing a low cut vest and trousers. The applicant touched her right breast inside her clothing and asked, ""Are you going to play along and make it easier for yourself""? She did not reply but started shaking. He said, ""You need to calm down a bit and take a minute or we will go to the police station now"".

13The applicant then pulled his shorts and underwear down, exposing his penis. He grabbed ND's right hand and placed it on his erect penis. She pulled her hand away. 

14There was some further conversation, in the course of which the applicant said, ""You are not going to cause any trouble for me are you?"" He then touched her breast again, rubbed her leg, and moved her hand back to his penis, saying ""Are you having a good time?"" 

15At this point ND realised that her door was unlocked. She opened it, alighted and fled. Eventually she obtained a lift from a stranger back to the city. 

16ND reported the matter to police on 23 December 2010 after she had received advice from a friend and a counsellor. The subsequent investigation involved ND having telephone conversations with the applicant; the calls were initiated by her under police supervision and the conversations were recorded. The applicant continued with the pretence that he was a police officer. The conversations led to his arrest at a supposed meeting with ND on 13 January 2011. 

17In a recorded interview the applicant made admissions to having met with ND on the night of 21 December 2010 but claimed that he did so as a customer of a sex worker. He said that after they had driven to Heffron Park she became angry and left his car when he told her that he did not have the required amount of money to pay her. He denied impersonating a police officer. 

Victim impact statement

18ND provided a victim impact statement which she read. There was no objection to the judge taking the contents of the statement into account. It was lengthy, detailed and eloquent of the substantial emotional and psychological suffering ND had experienced as a result of the applicant's conduct. It is clear that recovery will be a slow process for her and only time will tell whether it will ever be complete.

Personal circumstances of the applicant

19The applicant was born in 1979 and so was aged 31 at the time of the offences. 

20He had a criminal record with no entries of any real significance.

21The judge said in his sentencing remarks that there were ""significant subjective matters"" to which he had regard. The first that he mentioned were the applicant's pleas of guilty shortly before his trial for which he allowed a reduction of sentence in the order of 10 per cent. 

22His Honour described the applicant's background as ""indeed sad"". He was brought up in a dysfunctional family. His father was physically and verbally aggressive towards the applicant and his mother. From an early age the applicant had problems with obesity; he suffered from anxiety and depression; and he was unable to form friendships at school or to participate in sporting events. In adult life he experienced problems in obtaining and maintaining employment.

23His parents separated. His father took him to Queensland and ordered him not to speak with his mother. His father was subsequently gaoled and the applicant returned to New South Wales. His mother attempted suicide. He was living with his mother at the time of sentence.

24The applicant was in part-time employment as a carer and in receipt of a carer's pension. The judge noted the hardship that would be occasioned to the recipient of this care, who was heavily dependent upon the applicant, by the applicant's incarceration.

25The applicant was under the care of a psychiatrist and a psychologist in relation to his problems with severe depression and impulsivity, although the judge did not find that these conditions were causative of the offences. He did, however, allow for the fact that he would find his time in gaol more difficult because of his depression. 

26The applicant was undertaking a specialist sex offender program (he attended the first session on the morning of the sentencing hearing). He had indicated his remorse to a psychologist and an officer from the Probation and Parole Service and there were various testimonials attesting to the applicant's otherwise good character. 

27The judge found that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend. Special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were found that warranted a reduction of the minimal custodial proportion of the sentences. These were that the applicant required ongoing rehabilitation in the community; that he had no significant prior record; and that the sentences for the two offences would be partially accumulated.

Grounds of appeal

1. The sentencing judge erred by failing to characterise the seriousness of the offences

28Counsel for the applicant in written submissions referred to the following passage of the sentencing remarks:

The offences are serious offences. The seriousness of the offences is reflected in the maximum penalties contained in the Crimes Act 1900. All persons in this community must be protected by the courts and the sentences I impose today will have within them a significant degree of both individual and general deterrence.

29It was submitted to have been erroneous for the judge not to ""characterise the seriousness of the offences"" or to make an assessment of their objective gravity. It was also noted that there were ""no specific findings in relation to the presence of aggravating or mitigating factors under section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or the common law. It was submitted, ""In short, there was no formal attempt to analyse the seriousness of the offence other than by reference to the maximum penalties"". 

30Reference was made to Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [46] and Speechley v R [2012] NSWCCA 130 at [83], both per Johnson J, as authority for the proposition that an assessment of the objective gravity of an offence is an important part of the sentencing function.

31Counsel referred to competing submissions that were made in the District Court as to the objective gravity of the offences and complaint was made that the judge made no finding to resolve that contentious issue. Reiterating that there was a failure to make findings as to aggravating and mitigating factors in ss 21A(2) and (3) that were relevant to the case, counsel submitted that there was an error in the exercise of the sentencing discretion by virtue of a failure to take into account material considerations, citing House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499.

32All of this was said to have resulted in the judge placing too great an emphasis on personal and general deterrence, imposing sentences that exceeded the objective gravity of the offences and which were higher than were warranted at law.

33These submissions were further developed during the hearing of the application. Reference was made to the judgment of Johnson J in Corby v R [2010] NSWCCA 146 where a similar ground of appeal was raised. It was submitted in that case that various issues had been raised by counsel for the applicant in the District Court that bore upon an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences, but that these submissions were not referred to in the remarks on sentence, nor were any findings made by reference to them. The Crown accepted that this was so, but countered that the judge's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences could be inferred from the sentences actually imposed.

34Johnson J referred (at [49]) to authority for the proposition that, aside from any need for an assessment of the objective seriousness of offences for which a standard non-parole period was prescribed (this was pre-Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120), there was a common law duty to make an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence. 

35But his Honour also referred (at [50]) to the judgment of Simpson J in R v McEvoy [2010] NSWCCA 110 at [89] where her Honour referred to an omission to make a finding concerning the position of an offence on the range of objective seriousness as ""an error of process"" not necessarily indicating that there was error in the imposition of the sentence. Such an error of process may occur but the sentence may lie nonetheless within the range of the sound exercise of sentencing discretion. His Honour also observed (at [51]) that there is a need for this Court in assessing remarks on sentence to place an emphasis upon substance rather than form. Ultimately, he concluded (at [55]) that the sentencing judge in that case had failed to comply with the requirements of the law to give reasons for sentence. In his reserved sentencing judgment, the judge had only made general statements concerning the class of offending, despite submissions that had been made concerning matters relevant to the assessment of the level of seriousness of the offences.

36For the Crown it was submitted that the sentencing judge did characterise the seriousness of the offences in that he said, ""The offences are serious offences"". This was consistent with something he said during the submissions on sentence: ""Yes, the offences are very serious offences"". He had also observed during the course of the Crown's submissions that the impersonation offence was ""sophisticated"". 

Determination of Ground 1

37The can be no question that the objective seriousness of an offence is a fundamental consideration in the assessment of sentence. But the degree to which it is an issue that needs to be analysed, discussed and determined varies according to the circumstances of the case. In Belghar v R [2013] NSWCCA 245, this Court rejected a contention that a sentencing judge was required to express a conclusion as to where in the objective range the offending fell by reference to the maximum penalty for the offence. But, after referring to considerable authority on the subject, both before and after the decision in Muldrock, Gleeson JA concluded (at [60]) that ""any sentencing decision calls for attention to be paid to the objective gravity of the offending"" but ""it is not necessary for the sentencing judge to have made a finding as to where precisely it lay in the spectrum of offending"". 

38The submissions made to the sentencing judge by counsel then appearing for the applicant were primarily devoted to subjective matters in an attempt to persuade his Honour to impose something other than a full-time custodial sentence. The only submissions she made that were relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences were that there should be a finding that the applicant's actions were ""impulsive"" and that ""the indecent assault was of brief moment"". 

39The Crown Prosecutor made more elaborate and detailed submissions about matters bearing upon the seriousness of the offences. She presented a reasoned argument as to why the offences should not be found to be impulsive. She submitted that there was ""a degree of menace involved"" by virtue of the threats made by the applicant. The complainant was so disturbed and in such fear that she was shaking. An aspect that rendered the indecent assault more serious was that the applicant had taken the complainant to an isolated location; and it only ceased when she managed to flee. Accordingly, it was submitted that the objective seriousness of the offences, although not ""high range or anything of that nature"", was at such a level that nothing less than a full-time custodial sentence was warranted.

40In response, counsel for the applicant submitted that the judge should not find that the impersonation offence was sophisticated, and, in the context of the complainant being a sex worker, should not conclude as the Crown had submitted that she had been ""lured"" into the applicant's car. 

41There was only one aspect of the applicant's subjective case that was the subject of any submission by the Crown Prosecutor. She did not dispute that he suffered from depression but contended that this should not operate to reduce the significance of general deterrence. Otherwise there was no dispute as to any of the favourable findings that were available to be made by his Honour concerning subjective circumstances. 

42The practical reality of the proceedings on sentence was that a single question was being posed for his Honour's determination. That was whether, despite the favourable subjective matters (pleas of guilty, lack of significant prior convictions, remorse, good prospects of rehabilitation, unlikelihood of re-offending, unfortunate circumstances of the applicant's upbringing, and his depression and impulsivity) the offences were at such a level of objective seriousness that only a full-time custodial sentence could be imposed. It is obvious that the judge answered that question in the affirmative.

43It was submitted by counsel for the applicant that ""the indecent assault was of brief moment"". His Honour did not directly refer to this, but his recitation of the facts was an ample response. The gravity of that offence was not to be measured so much by the time that it took but by what the applicant actually did and the context in which he did it.

44The other contentions raised by counsel for the applicant were answered by his Honour during submissions. There he expressed his view that the impersonation offence was ""sophisticated"", the antithesis of impulsive. He explained:

[I]t was sophisticated in relation to the conversations that were held between himself and the victim, the manner of speaking, the knowledge that he had about the places where prostitutes were permitted to work and not permitted to work, the fact that he wasn't going to [s]how his name because he was acting undercover, the fact that he had an explanation as to why the car did not have a siren, that style of conversation was a sophisticated style of conversation. (POS 22.5)

45His Honour expressly rejected the submission that the complainant was not ""lured"" into the applicant's car. (POS 23.18)

46In the assessment of the adequacy of his Honour's reasons it must be borne in mind that his Honour proceeded immediately to deliver judgment upon the conclusion of submissions. In those circumstances it would be both unrealistic and impractical to expect a judge to slavishly repeat every conclusion he or she had reached and announced only minutes before.

47A final matter to deal with is the submission in this Court that there was a failure of his Honour to refer to matters in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The issue of whether the offences were planned or were sophisticated (in the sense explained by his Honour) might have been matters relevant to ss 21A(2)(n) and (3)(b), whether or not they were ""part of a planned or organised criminal activity"". No other matter mentioned in s 21A that was relevant to the objective seriousness of the offences was raised for his Honour's consideration. There was no requirement for his Honour to discuss and decide matters that were not relevant or not in issue.

48I would reject this ground.

2. The sentences imposed, both individually and jointly, were manifestly excessive having regard to the objective and subjective circumstances

49With the nominated ""discount"" for the utilitarian value of the applicant's pleas of guilty, it was submitted that the starting point for the impersonation offence must have been slightly in excess of 3 years and that for the indecent assault, a little in excess of 2 years 9 months. When considered against the maximum penalties for these offences of 7 years and 5 years respectively, it was contended that these starting points were excessive.

50The written submissions for the applicant included reference to Judicial Commission sentencing statistics. However, because the offence of aggravated impersonation of a police officer had been only recently created, it was conceded that the limited number of cases in the statistical database meant they were of ""limited value"".

51The Crown had submitted to the sentencing judge that the impersonate offence was objectively serious but the prosecutor said, ""I'm not submitting it's high range or anything of that nature"". Based on that submission, counsel for the applicant reiterated his contention that the starting point of just over 3 years was manifestly excessive.

52It was submitted that the objective seriousness of the indecent assault offence should have been found to be below the middle of the range. There was a touching of the breast and a placing of the victim's hand on the applicant's penis. There was little or no planning and the incident was relatively brief.

53Other factors that were said to be relevant were that the applicant had no significant prior convictions, there was no physical violence or threats of violence, the applicant was not in a position of trust, the victim was not in a particular category of vulnerable persons, there were pleas of guilty, and the applicant was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation.

54The applicant's counsel referred to a number of other cases in this Court in an endeavour to make good this ground in respect of the indecent assault offence. It was accepted that caution was required for two reasons. Often this offence is finalised in the Local Court, and when finalised in the District Court, it is often in association with other and more serious offences. Accordingly, when the offence of indecent assault has come to be considered by this Court on appeal from the District Court, there are few cases that are comparable to the present.

Determination of Ground 2

55The offence of impersonation of a police officer was formerly in s 204 of the Police Act 1990 (NSW). The maximum penalty was 6 months imprisonment and/or a fine of 100 penalty units. Section 204 was deleted on 1 July 2007 when amendments made by the Police Amendment (Miscellaneous) Act 2006 (NSW) took effect. A new s 546D was inserted in the Crimes Act providing in sub-s (1) the same basic offence of impersonating a police officer but increasing the maximum penalty of imprisonment to 2 years while retaining the same level of additional or alternative fine. A new aggravated form of the offence was provided in sub-s (2) involving the additional elements that there was an intention to deceive and that the offender purported to exercise a power or function of a police officer. The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years. It may be taken that these amendments by Parliament indicated that such offences were to be regarded as more serious and warranted a higher level of criminal sanction than was previously the case.

56The sentencing statistics for the impersonation offence are of no assistance. There have only been 10 cases involving the aggravated form of the offence and they were all dealt with in the Local Court. In relation to the indecent assault offence they simply demonstrate that the sentence imposed was towards the higher end of sentences that have been imposed in the past: in the current iteration of the statistics, where there had been a plea of guilty, 82 per cent of full-time custodial sentences were of 2 years 6 months or less with the median sentence being 2 years. The majority of cases where indecent assault is the primary offence are dealt with in the Local Court. 

57These statistics do not assist the applicant. That is particularly so when it is borne in mind that his Honour was not sentencing for two offences in isolation. There was a substantial overlap in the circumstances of the offences. And it must be remembered that there was a substantial overlap in the sentences themselves; 1 year out of the 1 year 3 months non-parole period of the indecent assault sentence is to be served concurrently with the non-parole period for the impersonation offence.

58The cases involving sentencing for indecent assault offences that were relied upon in support of this ground do not assist the applicant either. The facts in each case were markedly different and/or less serious than in the present case.

59Lipchin v R [2013] NSWCCA 77 involved a number of sexual offences, two being aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(2). They involved significantly less serious conduct (a mature woman in her own home kissed a 15 year old friend of her son and rubbed his crotch through his underpants). For these offences the sentences were 1 year and 2 years respectively.

60Jiang v R [2010] NSWCCA 277 involved a sentence for indecent assault committed at the same time as two offences of sexual intercourse without consent. A 6 month fixed term sentence was entirely subsumed by the sentences for the other offences. The application in this Court did not require consideration of the appropriateness of the sentence for indecent assault.

61In Huntingdon v R [2007] NSWCCA 196 it was held that a sentence of 20 months for indecent assault was not manifestly excessive. The offender grabbed the arms of a woman who was being held down and who was partially clothed and covered with a blanket, he removed the blanket and her underwear and urged another person who was present to look at her breasts and genitalia. 

62In R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20, there was an indecent assault committed as a culmination of a series of physical and sexual assaults over a number of days by an offender against his 8 month pregnant partner. After a physical assault, the offender referred to the victim as ""a dirty slut"", urinated upon her and said ""take that"". This indecent assault brought a fixed term sentence of 12 months that was entirely subsumed by other sentences where the overall term was one of 9 years. The indecent assault sentence was not manifestly inadequate but one of the other sentences was; the overall term was increased to 10 years.

63BT v R [2012] NSWCCA 267 concerned a sentence of 2 years 6 months for an indecent assault which was subsumed by sentences for aggravated sexual assault inflicting actual bodily harm and sexual intercourse without consent. The overall term imposed upon the juvenile offender was 10 years. The offences were committed by two juvenile detention centre inmates upon a fellow inmate on successive nights. The indecent assault involved using duress to require the victim to masturbate the offenders prior to the commission of the aggravated sexual assault offence. The appeal, which was dismissed, was not at all concerned with the appropriateness of the indecent assault sentence.

64The indecent assault offence in the present case may have involved physical activity that was of a lesser level of seriousness than encountered in other cases. But it was rendered more serious by virtue of the circumstances. The complainant had been lured into the applicant's car and driven to a relatively isolated location in the middle of the night by a man who indicated that he wanted sexual services to be provided to him on his own terms. The fear she experienced was apparent from the description in the statement of facts of her shaking and the applicant telling her to ""calm down"" and from the fact that she ran from the car as soon as she became aware of the opportunity to do so.

65The impersonation was significantly serious as well. The target of the applicant's deception was a young woman whose vulnerability was exploited for his own sexual gratification. The offence could not possibly have been characterised as impulsive, as counsel submitted in the District Court. The facts included that the applicant drove past the complainant about four times before he stopped to engage her in conversation, purporting to be a potential customer. He then drove off and returned and engaged in similar conversation before claiming to be a police officer. In the telephone conversations with the complainant about three weeks later, the applicant maintained his pretence. The submission that it was impulsive was rightly rejected by the judge.

66In my view the contention that the sentences, individually and collectively, are manifestly excessive is not made out.

Facts
5On the morning of 15 February 2011 two men, one of them in possession of a baseball bat, attempted to rob the Westpac Bank at Lane Cove but instead robbed two employees of the bank of possessions, the subject of the charges. There was no dispute that this had occurred nor that the robbers made their escape in a Mitsubishi car, the subject of the fourth count. That car was identified by a witness and found two days later. The issue in the trial was whether the appellant was one of those two men.

6The case brought by the Crown was a circumstantial case consisting of the following elements:

(1) A pair of sunglasses was found in the getaway car two days after the offences. The appellant gave evidence those glasses belonged to him and expert evidence called at the trial identified his DNA on the glasses. That evidence was that the appellant's profile on the DNA would occur in fewer than one in ten billion individuals. The appellant said that he lost those glasses when he was working casually some time in 2010. Ms Atack said the glasses depicted in a photograph taken by the police were very similar to glasses worn by the robbers. 

(2) Police found a long sleeved fluoro style work shirt similar in style to a short sleeved shirt worn by one of the robbers when police searched the appellant's house. 

(3) The police also found fingerless gloves at the appellant's house although it was accepted those gloves did not have markings on them similar to markings on fingerless gloves worn by one of the robbers.

(4) Tracksuit pants found in the appellant's house had a label on them similar to a mark visible on tracksuit pants worn by one of the robbers.

(5) Shoes seized from the appellant's house were similar to shoes worn by one of the robbers.

(6) One of the victims of the robbery, Ms Srinivas, took part in a photographic identification exercise. She was shown 20 photographs and when asked had she seen any of them she said ""None of them except maybe 3 or 17"". Photograph 17 was a photograph of the appellant.


Ground 1: The trial miscarried
7This ground relates to an assertion that as a result of the other grounds of appeal there was no fair trial.

Ground 2: The trial judge erred in admitting evidence
(1)This submission asserts error in admitting the photo identification evidence of the victim Rohini Srinivas. 

8Objection was taken to this evidence firstly on the basis that only two of the persons in the photo array had facial hair which could be described as light brown and also on the basis that the prejudice outweighed the probative value because of the vagueness of the evidence of the witness. 

9When asked had she seen any of the persons before she said ""None of them except maybe 3 or 17"". She said ""The two men had their face mostly covered. They were wearing sunglasses and hats. I am only going by the face structure so I can't be 100 per cent sure."" She also said ""I can't really say for sure because um most of the face was covered"" and ""I am not really sure but it is just a possibility"" and she also said ""Just from the face structure because it was a thin face so I know it is not one of those filled out faces definitely.""

10That evidence does not amount to identification of the appellant but the prosecution made it plain it was not relied upon as identification evidence and in summing up to the jury the judge dealt with this issue by saying ""She was saying maybe he resembles that person; this was very different from an identification."" The judge went on then to give a clear direction that ""Judges know that resemblance evidence can be unreliable"". He then went on to warn of the special caution needed when considering such evidence and gave appropriate directions to the jury that they should be satisfied the witness was both honest and reliable and warned the jury to consider the circumstances under which the observations were made including that the witness was under stress, the person was a stranger, the opportunity to observe, the lighting and the fact that she was not shown the photographs until six months after the event.

11A submission is made that the trial judge failed to carry out a balancing exercise in making a decision as to the admissibility of the evidence and that he failed to take account of the unreliability of the evidence and it is suggested he did not follow the decision in Dupas v The Queen [2012] VSCA 320 because the judge was called on to determine whether the prejudice outweighed the probative value. Any evidence led by the Crown tending to prove the guilt of an accused is necessarily prejudicial. In this case the judge was dealing with a number of pieces of evidence which considered together might be capable of proving the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. It was not suggested that this evidence by itself could prove guilt. The decision made by the judge on this objection was only one of a number of decisions made by the judge on objections to evidence and he did disallow some evidence on the basis that the prejudice outweighed probative value. It is clear he was carrying out a balancing exercise in respect of all the objections including this one. The judge's decision to admit it cannot be criticised. Moreover the debate arising from the decisions of Dupas v The Queen supra and R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; 66 NSWLR 228 does not arise here because the value of the evidence by itself was never suggested as being capable or proving guilt and the strength of the evidence was always apparent. 

(2)This submission asserts error in admitting evidence of the finding of two pairs of fingerless gloves in the accused's premises on 10 August 2011.

12Again it was never suggested that this evidence by itself could prove guilt. The only basis for the admission of this evidence was that it demonstrated the appellant was a person who had fingerless gloves. It was never suggested these fingerless gloves were worn by one of the robbers. 

13In my view the judge did not err in allowing this evidence to be admitted, particularly when the evidence was admitted for a very limited purpose.

(3)This submission asserts error in admitting evidence of the finding of a long sleeved fluoro top in the accused's premises on 10 August 2011.

14Again this evidence was admitted for a very limited purpose, that being to demonstrate that the appellant was someone who wore fluoro type work jackets. It was never suggested the jacket found was actually worn by one of the robbers. For the same reasons as given above, there was no error in admitting this evidence. 

(4)This submission asserts error in admitting evidence of similarity between a pair of sunglasses located in the getaway car and those worn by the robbers.

15These were sunglasses found in the car which was identified as the getaway car used by the robbers. The evidence of the witness Glenys Atack about the glasses was ""It is very very similar, very very similar to what I saw and they were definitely blue, they were definitely blue.""

16This evidence was clearly admissible because the glasses were found in the getaway car and the witness's evidence given on the voir dire strengthened the conclusion the glasses were worn by a robber. These were the glasses which contained the DNA of the appellant. There was no failure by the trial judge to assess questions of prejudice or probative value. The only other matter which arose was the fact that the glasses had been lost and could not be available as an exhibit although photographs of them were. The judge ultimately drew this to the attention of the jury.

Ground 3: The trial judge erred in failing to reconsider the admissibility of the resemblance evidence concerning the sunglasses
17During the trial the witness Glenys Atack said of the police ""... they asked me whether they were very very similar to the ones that you know the particular people were wearing that morning."" It is submitted that the judge took into account in admitting the evidence that the witness had not been told where the glasses were found. The point raised by the appellant is that this evidence shows the police suggested the glasses were ""very very similar"" and that made the evidence of the witness unreliable. That was an argument open to the defence but the witness was available to give evidence, she did give evidence and it was a matter for the jury to determine if that evidence was reliable. Her evidence remained clear about the similarity of the glasses found with glasses worn in the robbery. 

Ground 4: The trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury on the dangers of similarity or resemblance evidence in respect to the sunglasses
18The jury was given very clear directions about the danger of resemblance evidence relating to the photo identification by the witness. There is no reason to believe the jury did not understand that direction. The judge reminded the jury in the summing up that the evidence relating to the sunglasses was that they did ""fit the description ... of the glasses as given by one of the victims on the day of the alleged robbery."" He also repeated the submission of defence counsel to the jury that because the glasses were lost they could not be shown to the witness when the witness was giving evidence. It is also the fact that no submission was made to the judge that he should give a separate warning about resemblance evidence in respect of the sunglasses. For that reason it would be appropriate to refuse leave to raise this ground under Rule 4. Otherwise the evidence in this case about the sunglasses was an acceptance by the appellant that the glasses were his. There was scientific evidence his DNA was found on them and they were found in the getaway car. In my view there was no need for a separate warning to be given about the evidence of the witness that they were ""similar"" to glasses worn by one of the robbers. The jury also had access to video of the robbery and a photograph of the glasses worn. 

Ground 5: The trial judge erred in failing to direct the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the sunglasses located in the vehicle were worn by the accused in the robbery
19Again no specific request was made for such a direction and I would refuse leave for it to be argued under Rule 4. Moreover, no such direction was needed in addition to the warnings given by the judge of the need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. Not only did the judge give clear directions about the onus and burden of proof but he also gave clear directions repeating defence counsel's submission that ""All these points on circumstantial evidence could never persuade you beyond reasonable doubt that it was the accused who involved himself in this robbery"". He went on to say: ""As I have said to you though, before you draw any inference or conclusion as to an essential ingredient, in this case the identity of the man in the white hat, you must be satisfied as to the existence of the facts and circumstances from which you are asked to draw that conclusion. You must, members of the jury, in that exercise avoid speculation; you must avoid conjecture in arriving at any such conclusion."" He went on to say: ""If you draw an inference adverse to the accused and in favour of the prosecution in respect of circumstantial evidence, it must be the only inference which in your view can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt; that follows from the directions I have given you."" He also said: ""But if at the end of that weighing process there is more than one conclusion than the conclusion urged upon you by the prosecution, then obviously the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and you would be obliged to acquit.""

20In Shepherd v The Queen (1990) HCA 56; 170 CLR 573 Dawson J said that where dealing with a circumstantial case based on links in a chain it may be necessary to direct that a particular fact must be found beyond a reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference is drawn. He went on to say: 

""But where - to use the metaphor referred to in Wigmore on Evidence, vol 9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981), par 2497; pp. 412-414 - the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning. It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so. It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence."" 

21In my view the directions given by the trial judge were appropriate and this ground of appeal must fail. 

Ground 6: The trial judge erred in giving inadequate directions regarding the use that the jury might make of the evidence of the fluoro jacket and gloves
22The argument advanced here is that the judge should have given a warning to the jury ""about drawing conclusions in respect of items of common possession within the community and warned against tendency reasoning."" The trial judge drew the attention of the jury to the fact that the prosecution case relied on circumstantial evidence and then went on to enumerate what the circumstances were. Those circumstances included amongst others that the appellant wore fluoro shirts and also fingerless gloves. The judge did draw attention to the question ""How many fluoro shirts are owned by people in Sydney"" and ""How rare is it for people to have fingerless gloves"" and in respect of the tracksuit pants ""How many hundreds of thousands of tracksuit pants are there to be bought at markets and worn so frequently in the city? And similarly the shoes ... The police officer conceded they are available to be purchased"". The judge then went on to warn the jury that it was essential for them to ""... examine the circumstantial evidence with care and consider whether it is reliable before you could draw the conclusion sought to be drawn in the submission from the Crown.""

23Again this matter was not one raised at the trial and I would refuse to allow the ground to be raised under Rule 4. I would do so because the direction suggested in this ground was not necessary or even appropriate in the context of the warnings and directions given by the trial judge.

Ground 7: The trial judge erred in failing to appropriately deal with a jury question
24The jury asked the question ""How long does DNA last for?"" The judge told the jury that there had been no evidence led on the issue.

25The question was asked during the summing up and at a stage when all the evidence had been completed. 

26There was no obligation to call any further evidence. Neither the prosecution nor defence asked for further evidence to be called. The judge told the jury they must consider the evidence as it was given. This was not an issue in the trial. The prosecution did not suggest or submit DNA evidence could not last even though the defence case was that the DNA must have been there since some time in 2010. Perhaps a matter of some significance was the finding of the glasses on the floor of the car in front of the passenger's seat and readily visible in the photos tendered. The judge had earlier told the jury not to speculate. In those circumstances the answer given by the judge to the jury was the appropriate answer and I would refuse leave to raise this ground.

Ground 8: The accused was incompetently represented
(1) Failing to adequately deal with the DNA issue.

27It is suggested counsel at trial should have asked Ms Friedman, the scientific expert, how long DNA would remain to dispel the notion that it must have been recent. There was no evidence on this point. The jury was told not to speculate. The state of the evidence was left to the jury on the basis therefore that the version given by the appellant that he left the glasses somewhere in 2010 was not impossible. That left the appellant in the best position he could have been in and there is no incompetence of defence counsel demonstrated.

(2) Failing to establish the witness Atack had made a positive identification of a person not the appellant.

28The witness did not identify anyone at first but then identified the second robber as the one who made her open the bank. This was not a matter of significance in the case against the appellant. She did, however, give her evidence about the similarity of the sunglasses. 

(3) Failing to make a fresh application for exclusion of the evidence - relates to Ground 3.

29This issue raises the same argument advanced in Ground 3. Because the evidence was admissible and should have been admitted there was no incompetence in counsel not raising it again. 

(4) Failure to draw attention to the ambiguity of the identification evidence of the witness Srinivas.

30The failure of Srinivas to say which of the two robbers she was saying the accused's photo resembled was not of any consequence in the trial bearing in mind it was quite obvious the two robbers were acting in concert. No incompetence of counsel is shown. 

(5) Failing to object to a chart.

31Pursuant to s 29(3) of the Evidence Act 1995 the chart was admissible and failure to object to it does not demonstrate incompetence. 

Ground 9: The verdict was unreasonable
32In Raumakita v R [2011] NSWCCA 126; 210 A Crim R 326 at 332-333 [31-34] Johnson J said:

""[31] In determining a ground of appeal which asserts, for the purpose of s.6(1) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, that the verdict was unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, this Court is required to apply the test set down in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; 181 CLR 487 at 493, and restated in MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606. The Court is to make an independent assessment of the evidence, both to its sufficiency and quality. This involves a question of fact. The Court is to determine whether the evidence is such that it was open to a jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the Appellant was guilty. The central question is whether this Court is satisfied that the Appellant is guilty of the offence charged in the first count: Morris v The Queen [1987] HCA 50; 163 CLR 454 at 473; SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; 85 ALJR 571 at 575 [11]-[14], 576-577 [20]-[22].

[32] In exercising that function, the evidence ought not be considered piecemeal: The Queen v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; 228 CLR 618 at 637-638 [46]-[48]; The Queen v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; 236 CLR 397 at 435 [128]. This Court is required to consider the totality of evidence before the jury. This involves an assessment of direct evidence of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from a combination of events: Rasic v R at [29].

[33] In some cases, the fact that the Court of Criminal Appeal has not seen or heard the witnesses at trial may have a bearing on the outcome of an appeal on an unreasonable verdict ground. In M v The Queen, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson, Toohey JJ said at 494-495:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. Although the propositions stated in the four preceding sentences have been variously expressed in judgments of members of the court in previous cases, we have put aside those differences in expression in order to provide authoritative guidance to courts of criminal appeal by stating the propositions in the form in which they are set out above."" 

[34] The M v The Queen formulation of the task of this Court has been emphasised by the High Court in later cases: The Queen v Nguyen [2010] HCA 38l 85 ALJR 8 at 14 [33]; SKA v The Queen at 575 [13].""

33There was no dispute in this case that the Mitsubishi car found two days after the robbery was the getaway car used by the robbers on 15 February 2011. That car had been in the possession of Mr Zeidan who worked for a car sales company. In his statement tendered at the trial he said the car was extremely clean and had no personal items in it when he drove it home on 24 May 2010. He discovered it had been stolen the next day. 

34There was no contest at the trial that the sunglasses found in the car belonged to the appellant. He said so himself. His DNA was found on the glasses and no other person's DNA was found on them. They were found on the floor in front of the front passenger's seat in full view. They were found next to a number of receipts stolen from Ms Atack during the robbery. The evidence of the appellant was that he may have had a ride in that car and left his glasses behind some time in 2010. On the face of it that story is unlikely and the jury had the opportunity of seeing him give evidence and evaluate him as a witness. The evidence that the glasses were ""very very similar"" to those worn by one of the robbers does add to the strength of the Crown case. The other evidence that his appearance was similar to that of one of the robbers and that items worn by one of the robbers were similar to items of clothing found at his home do add to the circumstantial evidence implicating him although by themselves they do not have great significance.

35A pair of two-tone blue and white shoes worn by one of the robbers bore substantial similarities to shoes found in the appellant's possession. Even the appellant acknowledged they were very similar.

36Having independently reviewed the evidence both as to its sufficiency and its quality, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the appellant was guilty of the offences charged. I agree with the verdict of the jury and it has not been demonstrated that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.

Ground 10: Fresh evidence
37In order to establish this ground it is necessary to demonstrate that the absence of the evidence gave rise to a miscarriage of justice, see Mickelberg v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 259 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ at 301. In this case the evidence could have been obtained. However, as new evidence it does not establish any better basis for determining whether the DNA evidence was fresh or not. It does no more than establish that given appropriate conditions DNA can last for a long time in cool, dry, dark, alkaline and sterile conditions. It is less likely to last in warmth and moisture. This is not material which could have been of any assistance to the jury on the assumption which must be made that the jury made a decision based on the directions given them by the judge. Indeed, had the evidence been given it may well have been to the detriment of the appellant bearing in mind where the glasses were found. 

The trial miscarried
38For the above reasons, I do not believe the trial miscarried and I would dismiss the appeal. 

39R A HULME J: Some of the matters relied upon by the Crown in this circumstantial case were not particularly compelling. I refer in particular to the finding in the appellant's possession of fingerless gloves and a fluoro style work shirt of similar styles, but not the same as, those worn by a robber. But this case exemplifies the need for assessment of the overall force of all of the matters relied upon in a circumstantial case, rather than a piecemeal evaluation of individual matters. Having carried out that assessment myself, I am satisfied that the evidence established the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.

40As to the grounds that give rise to the application of Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules, this is yet another case of an ""armchair appeal"": Bin Sulaeman v R [2013] NSWCCA 283, R v Ita [2003] NSWCCA 174; (2003) 139 A Crim R 340, R v Fowler [2003] NSWCCA 321; (2003) 151 A Crim R 166 at [38], R v Button and Griffin [2002] NSWCCA 159; (2002) 54 NSWLR 455 per Heydon JA at [30]-[37], R v Fuge [2001] NSWCCA 208; (2001) 123 A Crim R 310 at [40] and R v King [2000] NSWCCA 507.

41As I indicated to Mr Ramage QC during the course of the hearing, this Court is always alive to the possibility of a miscarriage of justice and will readily intervene when it is detected, notwithstanding a point might not have been taken previously. However, where such grounds are completely devoid of merit and unrealistically ignore the real contest at trial, as in this case, such appeals are to be deprecated. That is for various reasons, not the least because they consume the time and energy of the Court and its judges that could be better spent on cases posing more realistic and meritorious grounds for consideration. And a baseless claim that there was a miscarriage of justice because trial counsel was incompetent, in an attempt to avoid the operation of r 4 should be adamantly deprecated. 

42The reasons of Blanch J encapsulate my own consideration of this case. I agree with his Honour's conclusions in relation to each ground and his proposal that the appeal be dismissed.

2705788,R v Ian DACEY; R v Lee DACEY (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1877,"ex tempore Judgment
1With regard to the written submissions of senior counsel for the accused Lee Dacey, I do not propose to direct the jury that the liability of Lee Dacey (the alleged ""non-actor principal"") is dependent upon or derived from negativing self-defence with regard to Ian Dacey (the alleged ""actor principal"").  It seems to me that such a direction would be contrary to what was said by the High Court in Osland v The Queen [1998] HCA 75; (1998) 197 CLR 316 and Huynh v The Queen [2013] HCA 6, and also what was said by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Bikic [2002] NSWCCA 227.  And I respectfully do not consider that the evidence in this trial somehow changes the elements of the offence of murder by joint criminal enterprise.  
2Secondly, I do not propose to direct the jury with regard to extended joint criminal enterprise that Lee Dacey needed to foresee the possible use of a knife or similar weapon on the part of Ian Dacey.  It seems to me that such an approach would be contrary to what was said by the High Court in McAuliffe v The Queen [1995] HCA 37; (1995) 183 CLR 108 and Clayton v The Queen [2006] HCA 58; (2006) 168 A Crim R 174; by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; (2002) 137 A Crim R 371, especially at [145] - [159]; and by R A Hume J in R v Hawi & ors (No 25) [2011] NSWSC 1671.
3Thirdly, I do not propose to direct the jury that it is an element of murder by way of joint criminal enterprise that the non-actor principal in the first degree be not only present pursuant to the agreement, and have agreed to the commission of the crime in question, but also participating in some physical sense in the events causing death.  It seems to me that that would be contrary to the whole tenor of Osland v The Queen, especially the judgment of McHugh J (to which reference has been repeatedly made since 1998), and also the recent decision of the High Court of Australia in Huynh v The Queen, especially at [36] to [39].  I do not consider that the evidence in the trial somehow alters the elements of the offence.
4Fourthly, it is quite true that a person who has entered into a joint criminal enterprise but who is not the actor principal with regard to the offence is referred to by lawyers and judges as a principal in the first degree.  So much has been the case, at the latest, since the judgment of McHugh J in Osland v The Queen in 1998.  But it does seem to me conducive to lack of comprehension on the part of the jury for me to say words to the effect that the Crown case against Lee Dacey is that he was a non-actor principal in the first degree by way of joint criminal enterprise.  
5I have suggested that some other simple word or phrase such as ""accessory"" be used in my summing-up and by all relevant parties.  It does not seem to me that to refer to Lee Dacey in those circumstances as an alleged accessory occasions any prejudice to the accused, and that it does serve to draw a distinction between the actor principal in the first degree and the non-actor principal in the first degree.  
6Having said that, I remain open to senior counsel for Lee Dacey formulating some alternative that finds favour with the Crown and also with me.  
7Finally, it could be that these issues should be revisited after the Crown case has been made perfectly clear in the Crown's address.  As I say, at this stage I do not consider that I should accede to any of those submissions of senior counsel for Lee Dacey.  
8To be clear, my first ruling does not encompass the question of whether self-defence should be left directly with regard to Lee Dacey himself, a topic to which I would now like to turn.

		20 April 2016",2013-11-26 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705791,Director of Public Prosecutions v AB [2013] NSWSC 1739,"Judgment
Note
1I have described the accused, the deceased and their daughter anonymously, principally to protect the identity of the last, who was aged but seven or so at the time of her mother's death.  By doing so, of course, I mean no disrespect.
Introduction
2On 8 October 2013 the accused was arraigned upon a charge that he, on 10 July 2010 at Wingham in the State of New South Wales murdered the deceased.  He was and is unfit to be tried.  This is a special hearing conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, pursuant to s 21(3)(a) of which he is taken to have pleaded not guilty to the indictment.  The special hearing was conducted without a jury. 
3That the deceased was killed by the accused on 10 July 2010 is uncontested.  The issues that arose in the special hearing were, in substance, whether he acted under provocation within the meaning of s 23 of the Crimes Act 1900 or, in the alternative, whether he was suffering from a substantial impairment within the meaning of s 23A of the Act which warranted his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter.  Accordingly, the only live question is whether he is guilty or otherwise of murder or manslaughter; it is not suggested that he could be acquitted completely.  It follows that, in due course, it will be necessary to impose a limiting term, being the best estimate of the sentence that would have been appropriate had there been a normal trial of the accused and he had been found guilty of the offence.  I should also mention that the finding is a qualified finding of guilt and does not constitute a basis in law for any conviction.
4On the question of provocation, the onus is on the prosecution to establish beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the crime of murder and that the accused was not acting under provocation in the relevant sense at the time of the offence.  If this be proved, the question of substantial impairment arises, on which the accused bears the onus of proof on the balance of probabilities. 
5I propose first to deal with what might be described as the objective circumstances of the killing and then with the psychiatric evidence as to the accused's state of mind.  As to the latter, it can be noted at this stage that the psychiatric evidence is all substantially to the same effect, namely, that (to use the words of s 23A(1)(a)), the accused's ""capacity to understand events, or to judge whether [his] actions were right or wrong, or to control himself... was substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition"".  The second limb of what it is useful to call this defence, namely whether that ""impairment was so substantial as to warrant liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter"" is, of course, not a medical question, but an issue for the tribunal of fact to determine and is in dispute.  I should also observe, at the outset, that s 23A(3) requires the effects of self-induced intoxication, if any, are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining the latter question.
6Not surprisingly, in light at least, of the medical evidence, the accused did not give evidence.  No adverse inference can be drawn from his silence; nor can his silence be used to fill any gap in the prosecution case.
The deceased is shot  
7The deceased and the accused had been in a domestic relationship for a number of years.  They had a daughter who, at the time of the killing, was seven years of age.  The deceased had ended the relationship by moving with her daughter out of their home at Mooral Creek, some 26 kilometres out of the town of Wingham, first to live with her sister and then to rented premises in Bungay Road, Wingham.  This house was fully detached with a single vehicle carport on its eastern side and a covered verandah running across the front accessed by stairs.  
8Mr Kevin George lived with his wife directly across the road from the deceased and had a clear view of the premises although, from his point of view, the verandah was obscured on the left hand side by a bushy tree.  At about 3.00pm on Saturday, 10 July 2010, Mr George was in his lounge room with the television on and the window open when he saw the accused arrive in his blue car and drive up onto the driveway leading to the carport.  He noticed that the car had stalled slightly as it left the road.  The accused alighted and walked up the steps to the verandah gate, which was opened by the deceased, whose daughter was also in view.  The accused walked onto the verandah and he and the deceased moved left and out of sight behind the tree.  The next thing Mr George saw was the accused come back down the steps, walk across to his car, open the back passenger side door, take out a rifle and walk back up onto the verandah.  Mr George had heard nothing up to this point.  He said that, ""pretty well straight away"" after the accused returned to the verandah, he heard four gunshots, the first two of which were spaced, and the second two rapid.  He could not see either the accused or the deceased.  He said that, if there had been a conversation in ordinary tones on the verandah, he would not have heard it but it was likely that he would have heard raised voices.  
9After the shots, the girl ran down the steps and away from the house.  The accused sat down on a seat on the verandah for a few moments (something less than a minute), appearing to be drinking something.  He then walked back down the steps to his car, opened the rear passenger door, put the rifle inside, got into the driver's seat and drove off.  Mrs George rang police and an ambulance whilst Mr George went to the verandah where another neighbour, Ms Lorraine Simpson, had arrived in the meantime.  
10Mr Michael Styles also lived across the road from the deceased's house.  He said that whilst he was at the back of his house he heard four shots coming from the other side of Bungay Road.  He went to the front of the house but saw nothing of significance.  He then heard a male voice yelling quite loudly something to the effect of, ""If you want to be a smart arse, what do you think about that?""  He then heard a child screaming and the man said, ""Well go and get the phone then"" and all then went very quiet.  Mr Styles went back inside his house, coming out a short time later when he saw a neighbour at the front.  He had seen a small blue car (clearly the accused's) some time earlier parked on the road near the driveway to the deceased's house.  When he went to the front of his house after the shots were fired he saw it being driven towards town.  He thought this was perhaps five minutes after the shots were fired. 
11Mr David Leach resided next door to the Styles.  (As it happened, he was the manager of a produce shop in Wingham and had earlier seen the accused in the shop four, or possibly five times, in the company of the deceased, although the last time he had seen her there was about three to four months earlier, alone.)  He said that, on 10 July 2010, he went for a walk some time after 2.30pm and, as he was returning to his house coming back down Bungay Road, he saw a blue Ford (the accused's vehicle) parked behind the deceased's car in the driveway of her house.  He was able to see the verandah running across the front of the house and noticed the accused sitting there, slouched forward with his hands on his upper legs.  He did not see anything in his hands.  Mr Leach continued to walk to his house.  It was then 3.19pm.  Shortly after, when he was at the back of his house, he heard two loud gunshots and then a female scream.  The gunshots sounded close, but he was unable to say what direction the sounds came from.  He thought there was about a five minute gap between the time he saw the accused on the verandah and the shots being fired.  After a very short delay, he heard another two gunshots coming from the same direction.  He did not hear anything after those shots.  He said that at some time about 4.30pm or 4.45pm he was driving down Bungay Road and saw the accused's vehicle driving in the opposite direction.
12Mr Lindsay Ellison resided in premises opposite the deceased's.  He was in his backyard when he heard four shots in quick succession, probably less than half a second apart.  They came from Bungay Road.  He went up into the house and, coming from the same direction as the gunfire, heard a small child crying.  Perhaps 30 seconds after the last shot he heard a male voice firmly and deliberately saying, ""Now walk away"".  He heard the child crying after these words were spoken.  He did not hear anyone saying, ""Now go away and get the phone"" or a child's voice yelling that she couldn't find the phone or didn't know how to use it.  From where he was standing he could see the deceased's car parked in the carport but did not see any car parked behind it.  He said that he did not see any vehicle leave after he heard the words spoken nor did he see any blue motor vehicle there that day.
13Ms Wetherall and her husband lived next door to the deceased's premises in Wingham.  She said that at about 3.30pm on 10 July 2010 she was in the kitchen of her house when she heard loud arguing between a man and a woman coming from the deceased's house.  This went on for about one minute or so and then Ms Wetherall heard four gunshots coming from where they were arguing.  She heard a female screaming and crying but was not sure whether this was an adult or a young girl.  Ms Wetherall went outside and saw the deceased's daughter run from the property.  As she did so Ms Wetherall saw a male walking from the front lawn to a blue coloured car which was parked in the driveway near the front of the house.  This was obviously the accused.  The car drove off at speed up Bungay Road towards town.
14An interview with the accused's daughter on 10 July 2010 and was tendered without objection.  She confirmed she was elsewhere in the house at the time of the shooting.  She said that her mother had told her to go to her room, having been telephoned by the accused's neighbour Mr Watt warning that the accused might be on the way to her house.  The child heard what she described as a banging and her mother screaming, so she ran outside to be told by the accused to ring triple 0.  She yelled, ""Well, if you want me to ring triple 0 you've got to help me find it"" and ran out of the premises to a neighbour's house.  
The injuries 
15The autopsy disclosed five gunshot wounds of which that to the right lower chest area had penetrated the heart.  There were four other wounds, being to the right upper arm, the back of the right thigh, the inside of the left forearm and the lower half of the right buttock.  All the injuries were significant and would have resulted in substantial blood loss.  Accordingly, death was determined to be the result of the multiple gunshot wounds.  Death ensued very quickly.  Ballistic examination showed that the rounds were .22-250 calibre.
The police investigation
16Police and ambulance units attended the premises shortly after the shooting.  Investigating police, Sergeant Kendell and Senior Constable Smoothy arrived at the scene at about 3.45pm.  No-one was inside the premises, although there was a small dog in the lounge room. The deceased was lying on the front verandah wearing jeans and a shirt.  Police noted a wound to her right thigh just above the knee and an amount of blood near her head.  
17At about 5.20pm Senior Constable Smoothy saw the accused's blue Ford in the process of turning out of Bungay Road.  He and two other officers then followed him in a police vehicle on which the warning devices were activated.  The accused did not stop or slow down but he was not speeding.  Another police vehicle stopped in front of the accused's car, blocking its path and it came to a halt.  Senior Constable Smoothy and two other officers approached the accused's vehicle with service pistols drawn and saw him seated in the driver's seat.  The rifle was in the front footwell.  The accused was removed from the car, placed on the ground and handcuffed and searched.  He was informed that he was under arrest and asked his name, which he gave.  An ammunition case containing a number of unspent cartridges was on the floor of the car together with a number of stubbies of VB beer, one of which was partly consumed.  He was put into the rear of a caged vehicle.  Sergeant Kendell, whilst talking to the accused, formed the opinion that he was moderately affected by intoxicating liquor, based on his speech being slurred and his eyes being glazed.  The accused refused to undergo a random breath test.  There was some further short conversation, which included the conventional caution.  When asked if he wanted to say anything at that stage, the accused said, ""No"".  Shortly afterwards he was taken to the police station at Taree, arriving shortly before 6pm.  In the field arrest form completed at the police station Sergeant Kendell noted that the accused appeared to be intoxicated.  The accused was introduced to the custody manager, Leading Senior Constable Blick.  Mr Blick stated that around 5.55pm the accused was moderately affected by alcohol, based upon the slurring of his speech, his eyes being glazed and very red and his actions being slow.  The accused told him he had drunk three VB beers since midday.  An unspent cartridge was found in the pocket of his trousers.  Whilst he was in the charge room dock holding area, he was asked again to undergo a breath analysis and, again, refused.  Mr Blick, took the accused through the prescribed form, informed him of his rights whilst in custody and cautioned him.  He said that his interaction with the accused led him to form the opinion that he was moderately affected by alcohol, again on the basis that his speech was slurred and his eyes were glazed.  
18At about 6.35pm the accused had a conversation with Detectives McWhirter and Kelly.  For reasons already stated, I ruled that this conversation was inadmissible.  At about 9.50pm Mr Blick again spoke with the accused to inform him of his rights under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002.  At about 10pm Detective McWhirter took the accused into an interview room where a recorded interview was conducted.  
Statements by the accused
19At 3.56pm on 10 July 2010, the accused called triple 0.  He was then at home in Mooral Creek.  The conversation opened with an introduction by the operator, to which the accused immediately responded, ""Well, I just shot my missus"".  He then gave his name, stated where he was and said, ""I shot her in Wingham"", identifying the premises.  He said, ""I shot her three times"".  He was asked whether he was okay and said, ""Yeah, I am so far but I won't be when you get here"".  This intention to kill himself was repeated a number of times during the conversation.  Amongst other things, he said that ""my little girl"" was at the house at the time, that she ran down the road, but he did not know where she went.  The operator asked - 
""Well, I'm just trying to, as I said, I'm just trying to understand what the situation was because I need --- 
Accused:  Well the situation was she made a cunt of me, so I shot her. Is that all right?""
He went on to say, during further conversation - 
""But what I'm trying to say to you is, listen, it was all right, while she was doing what she was doing but now it's fuckin' finished.  All right?  
Operator: OK.
Accused: All right?
Operator: Yeah.
Accused:  Now, everybody said to me, don't kill your missus because you've got a kid.  Well, fuck her too, and I don't care whether you like it or you don't.
Operator:  No, that ---
Accused:  That's the whole deal. 
... 
Operator:  OK.  So I can see that the police have been to the house.  I can't tell you what's going on there.  
Accused:  She must be awful sick 'cause I put three bullets in her.  
Operator:  I can't see that because I am not a police officer.  I'm an emergency ... operator.
...
Accused:  All I'm telling you is what I done... you know. I mean, I couldn't find the phone in the house, so I couldn't ring you ... But I'm home now.
...  
[The accused said that he would be dead by the time the police got to his home.]  
Operator:  I understand what you're saying about how you shot her and how bad it is.  
Accused:  Listen, she got three of the best bullets I ever seen in me life.  
Operator:  OK.
Accused:  All right?
Operator: Yeah.
Accused:  Now, I don't really care.  All I'm saying, she wasn't going to rob me no more.  
Operator:   OK.
Accused:  All right? The little one yes, I'm sorry for that but I done it.  All right? 
Operator:  Right.
Accused:  But I am going to kill myself anyway, but I'm just telling you I shot her and you must know that by now because I must've been there.""
He later added - 
""Well, because, you know what? They say they get the goldmine, you get the shaft.  Like, I'm 64 year old... And its not the best thing in the world to do, so fuck her.  She - I'm going to end up in the, in the arse of the world.  I've had three houses.  She fucking robbed me of all of 'em.""  
He added again - 
""Yes, I did shoot her and I hope she's dead.  I hope she fucking is... I hope she's fucking dead because she's not going to rob me no more. All right? ... I got nothing left... I mean, she's going to rob me of the house and I said, fuck you anyway, and I'm telling you the truth, fuck you anyway, so I went and shot her, you know?""
He said that it was ""just on the spur of the moment"".  He said that he had some psychological treatment that didn't help, the psychologist saying, ""You're as sane as the next person"".  He said - 
""Listen, when you live so far out in the bush and your wife leaves you and all that sort of shit and says drink's the problem...  I think, well, fuck you too, you've been here for 15 years and have put up for that long.  Now all of a sudden, she pissed off.""
He said that the deceased had been gone for four months and that he really missed her and their little girl - 
""Accused:  ... but she ran down the road when she seen her mother shot.  
Operator:  Oh, all right...  I suppose it'd be a bit scary.  
Accused:  Well, hang on, listen.  Everybody said, don't shoot your woman while the kid's there...Well, I had no choice.  I just walked in and went bang, bang, bang, and that's the end of you ... I said, fuck it I'm going to do it anyway. 
Operator:  Yeah?
Accused:  So I done, look, it just doesn't matter what I say to you ... The whole fact is I've done it and I feel guilty.""  
20The operator asked whether, when he left his home with the gun, he ""didn't actually go in with that intention... to shoot her?""  After a significant pause, the accused said - 
""Look ... understand this, I went with the intention of killing ... I've been here fuckin' 6 months on my own and she's getting all these benefits and all this shit and I got fuck all ... and I said fuck this, and she's a smart arse, you know?
...
Operator:  Well, that, you know, as I said, I'm listening to your opinion because I wasn't there ... so I don't know the situation.  
Accused: ... All I'm telling you, she was a smart arse ... and I spoke to her this morning.  She, oh, the little one doesn't want to come out anymore.  I said, why not.  You have a drink of a night.  I said, I only drink at home.  I put the kid to bed.  I've got everything in the world for that kid...  and she said she doesn't, well, I said, fuck you I don't want you to come here.  All right?""
He later added -
""I know I shot her, and I thought the first one didn't kill her, so I give her a couple more.  
Operator:  So three times you shot her?
Accused:  Yeah... I hope she's dead... because, you know, she wanted to rob me for half the house... and, if she died before me I get nothing.  
21The accused later said that his daughter was somewhere else in the house when he shot the deceased and did not see the shooting.  As the conversation went on, he repeated the complaints about the deceased leaving him in the lurch (as it were) when she was his carer, repeating that he meant to shoot her.  He said, ""I think, I think, I done what I had to do ... and I hope she dies.""  He said that he did not want to go gaol.  When he saw the deceased bleeding he asked himself, ""what have I done?"" but then justified himself by referring to her leaving him and wanting maintenance.  He repeated that he felt sorry for his daughter.  After he had talked a little about his house, he commented that he would not be living there because, ""What I've done is, 10 years"", a reference to gaol and, shortly after, ended the conversation.  
22I have set out this conversation in some detail because, as it seems to me, it clearly exposes the accused's state of mind at the time.  He knew what he was doing and why he did it and felt that it was justified.  It may be that he intended to commit suicide but it seems almost certain he did not attempt to do so.  Though the accused said that he had a drink, and occasionally slurred his words (a matter to which I refer later), he spoke coherently and quite calmly although he was plainly angry.  There were a number of bizarre statements, however, in particular that he seemed to want the operator's agreement that he had done the right thing or, at least, that he had no choice.  As a layperson, I find that difficult to reconcile with thinking that was altogether rational.
23The first conversation went for some 33 minutes.  At 4.39pm, a few minutes after it ended, the accused again called triple 0.  The conversation again started with his telling the operator that he had shot his partner.  He said that he did not know her condition but he thought it would be ""pretty crook"".  The operator took details of his address and where the shooting occurred.  He stated the deceased's name and mentioned that his daughter was at the house, although she did not actually witness the shooting.  There was conversation about the gun and how many shots he fired from it (""I reckon three or four"").  He said that he had been drinking, saying that he had had ""half a dozen [beers] today"" but, ""that's got nothing to do with what I'm talking about"".  He had also some tablets - it seems almost certainly this was his prescribed medication for various illnesses.  He told the operator, ""All I'm saying to you is that I shot her and I hope she's dead"".  The operator asked him where he was and whether he was alone (yes); they spoke about horses on the property which were sent away to be put down.  There was some conversation about racing and betting and the accused then said that he expected the police to arrive.  There was some conversation about whether he was going to stay in the house and the operator asked him to call back in an hour, to which the accused agreed.  He did not do so, after this conversation returning to Wingham when he was seen by police, as I have already mentioned.  
24The accused in this second conversation also appeared to be normal though, again, he slurred his words slightly from time to time.  He was clear, coherent and deliberate in his speech.
25I now come to the interviews with police.  An earlier interview was inadmissible for reasons stated at the time of its exclusion.  On a number of occasions during the second interview, he was taken to answers that he gave during the excluded interview and asked whether he agreed that he had earlier answered in that way.  It added little to what he had already said but, as no objection was taken to it, I have considered it together with the other answers given by the accused.  
26To police the accused repeated much of what he had already told the triple 0 operators.  Some additional details were disclosed, however, which should be mentioned.  The accused informed the police that he drank two stubbies of full strength beer on his way home after the shooting and ""I had the other four in the car... when I came back to town"".  (I take this to be on the occasion when he returned to the vicinity of the deceased's premises shortly before his arrest.  As will be seen, he had bought a six pack at the bottle shop in Wingham on his first trip into town that morning, before he went to see the deceased.)  The accused said he spoken twice to the deceased on the telephone during the morning before he went into Wingham.  (Telephone records show calls from the deceased's phone to that of the accused at 7.19am and 7.20am for just over five minutes.)  The accused said that they had argued about their daughter coming to stay overnight with the accused (which, as I understand it, was the usual arrangement).  The accused hung up on the deceased, who then rang back shortly afterwards.  They argued again about access, including - this is not entirely clear - complaints by the deceased that the accused was not feeding the child properly and about his drinking when she was with him.  The deceased offered to bring the child to the accused's house but wanted her to come home that night.  His response was, ""I don't want her here"".  The accused said that he drove into Wingham sometime around 8.30am to 9.00am and spoke to the deceased, accusing her of bad mouthing him to their daughter.  (Although he did not specifically say so, it is clear that the accused then returned home and later that day went to the deceased's premises on the occasion he shot her.)
27As usual the accused was videoed during the interview.  He appeared to me to be alert and coherent although slurred his words occasionally.  Some answers indicated either confusion or a lack of memory about events.  Thus, he did not think that he had been spoken to by police when being arrested or that he had spoken to a police officer at that time.  This may have been a reference to speaking about what had happened, but I think this is an artificial construction.  He said that he could not recall what he had earlier told the interviewing officer about his movements that day and could not explain why he did not remember, although he added, ""I'm not in the mood to be speaking about it"".  He said that the reason he returned to Wingham (when he was seen by police) was, ""I just wanted to see if everything was all right"", which strikes me as somewhat inconsistent with a real understanding of the seriousness of what he had done.  He said that, when he turned the corner, he saw police everywhere, ""So someone must have seen my car previous, I don't know"".  Of course, it must have been obvious that police were there because it was where the deceased had been killed; that he was followed by police, certainly suggested that his car had been identified.  This may have been mere misspeaking or perhaps, evidence of some confusion of thought.  Although he recalled making the triple 0 calls and was correct about having spoken to a woman first and then a man he could not recall what he told them and did not know the reason why he could not recall it.  He said that he could have spoken to them for 10 minutes, whereas it was actually just under an hour.  He thought that he had possibly told them about what had happened.  He said that he had spoken to no other people that he knew on this day, although, as will be seen, he had spoken to several of his neighbours.  When he was told that police had been informed he had walked back to the car after first speaking to the deceased and then got his gun, the accused responded that he did not know about this; he agreed that he walked back to the verandah with a gun and shot the deceased three times.  He could not recall where the deceased was when she was first shot but recalled where she was when the second and third shots were fired.  He did not know whether, at the time of the third shot, she was sitting up or lying down although she was not standing.  He denied saying anything to the deceased at this time.  He was asked the following - 
""Q453:  Did you check to see if [the deceased] was alive?A.  No.
Q454:  Did you, when you left [the deceased] did you think that she was dead?A:  Yeah.
Q455:  Did you go there purposely to kill her? A:  Not really, no.
Q456: Would it be fair to say that shooting her three times that more than like that she would die?A:  I'd say so, yeah.
Q457:  So why did you shoot her three times?A:  Why? I don't know, I don't know.""
28As to what the accused was thinking as he drove to the house, he said - 
""I honestly couldn't tell you, I was pissed off about the little one, I can tell you that but I really couldn't tell you."" 
He said that he did not know why he drove into town. 29These statements suggest that, while he had thought about killing the deceased - hence bringing the rifle with him - he had not definitely decided to do so until he went back to the car to get the rifle after what was almost certainly an initial interchange.  Even giving full weight to what he had told his neighbours about wanting to kill the deceased (which I deal with below) I do not think the answers given to police were attempts to avoid the truth.  I thought the accused was being candid.  When he did not wish to answer a question he simply said so, on a number of occasions.  I do not believe that he was attempting to prevaricate. 
30It is obvious from all the statements made by the accused after the event that he very deeply resented the deceased leaving him and demanding not only one half of the proceeds of the sale of the house but also maintenance.  The following appears to be a fair summary of his position, repeated frequently one way or other in all his conversations about the matter -  ""You know, I mean I earned the money to get the houses in the first place, I put her through fucken school, I put her through university, I put her through everything and this is what she does to me... and wants to laugh in my face... I said, 'No, enough's enough'...  I mean she's sitting in Wingham... and living the life of Riley and I'm struggling out in the bush... it just hurts me so bad...  I mean, I don't believe anybody can live with someone for fifteen years and turn dog.""   31As will appear, the accused was also troubled by a belief that the deceased may have been having an affair and, as well, that the child may not in fact have been his daughter.  As to the latter, he said that he believed the child was his daughter as far as he knew, but he did not know and, ""I took the responsibility of that child"".  As to the possibility of an affair, the accused said - 
""... look, I don't care what anybody says, I never tried to skin that woman.  I mean, I give her... what I thought was a fair thing...  But apparently it wasn't...  Now whether she's got the ah, well, I don't know what she's done, I've got no idea, she might have a man, I don't know, it's got me beat, it's just got me fucking lost, all right.""  
32He later added - 
""... I don't know whether, I don't know whether she's living with a bloke or whether he's living in town but he sees her five times a week, I've got no idea.  Then there's a shed around the back of her place, that's just as bad... and, I'm thinking, what's going on here?... I mean, for my missus to up and piss off the way she did just wasn't, um, she was a very smart woman.""
33Another element of the statements made by the accused about shooting the deceased is that, despite a number of opportunities, he never indicated any remorse, instead justifying what he did as the only course available, perhaps best exemplified in the following passage - 
""Q223  ... How did you feel when you did it?A  Not real good at all. Matter of fact, I was fucken lousy.
Q224 Yep. Then why did you do it?A   Well, when we, you put, you get your, you get your back against thewall and see how, if you're stuck between a rock and hard place, we'llsee what you do, all right. And that's exactly how I felt.
Q225  Did you feel that you didn't have any out apart from doing what youdid to [the deceased]?A   Well, what do you mean by that?
Q226   Well, there's other avenues, I mean, there's divorce, move - - - A   I wasn't, I wasn't married.
Q226  - - - move on with your life.A   I'm fucken 64, for Christ's sake... I live in the fucken bush, what are you telling me, what are you tell me now?
Q228 Well, there's other avenues - - - A   I think you're having, I think you're having a bit of a joke with me.
Q229 Well, no, there's other avenues apart from killing people available to you.A   Yeah. Well I've seen a - - - 
Q230 Can you tell me why you didn't take one of those avenues?A    - - - I've seen a psychologist for the last two weeks too...  And he didn't fucken help me... He reckons I'm as sane as the next bloke and I thought, well, you're fucken mad.""
34On the other hand, the accused was troubled by the fact that his daughter was in the house at the time although she did not actually see the shooting.  He said in answer to a question as to what he thought when he saw his daughter there, ""I felt fucking horrible, all right"".  
Earlier events
35The source for this material is the accounts of a number of witnesses who   lived in the vicinity of the accused's premises on Mooral Creek Road.  
36Mr Rodney Hile travelled to a friend's place on 10 July 2010 to do some maintenance, followed by a barbeque at about 2.00pm or so, he together with some friends drove back to Wingham along Mooral Creek Road much of which is winding and unpaved.  Mr Hile said he saw a small blue car (obviously, the accused's) coming in the opposite direction driving erratically.  As it came around a left hand bend it was on the wrong side of the road and the driver of Mr Hile's vehicle needed to swerve to the edge of the road to avoid it.  The road is narrow and two cars can only just pass each other.  Mr Hile thought that the blue car was travelling too fast for the conditions.  
37Mr Kevin Watt had resided in a rural property on Mooral Creek Road for some years and had met the accused and the deceased some time in the latter half of 2008.  They lived next door, the houses being about 200 metres apart.  Mr Watt said that, sometime after they first moved in, he would see the accused more or less daily, each visiting the other.  They would share a beer (or so) together.  Mr Watt also got to know the deceased.  His relationship with her developed into something more than just friendship from about the end of 2009; there was some physical affection between them, falling short, however, of intimate relations.  In about February or March 2010 the deceased and her daughter left the premises and Mr Watt helped her to move to her sister's house in Wingham.  They kept in contact and he saw her a few times over the ensuing months.  He and the accused continued to meet relatively frequently to have a beer or a cup of coffee.  Mr Watt, noticed that the accused, who had been a heavy drinker, started to drink more heavily when the deceased left.  He thought that the accused was ""pretty much drunk nearly every day at some stage of the day"".  On what I understand to be the first occasion upon which the accused mentioned to Mr Watt that the deceased had gone, he said, ""I told her to fuck off or I'd kill her and she's gone"" - he did not know where she had gone and did not care.  He later mentioned the deceased's departure every night when he had been drinking (and he was drunk most of the time).  He often threatened to kill the deceased or kill her daughter saying, ""I'll fix them up, I'll square it up, I'll get even"".  He would also say words like, ""I'll fuckin kill them, I'll kill both of them, I'll show them, I'll kill myself"".  Mr Watt said however, that when the accused was drunk, he was aggressive and threatened to kill anybody who upset him.  The accused also complained about the deceased having taken his property.  In due course Mr Watt and the accused helped the deceased to move into the premises in Bungay Road.  
38On the morning of 10 July 2010 at about 9.00am a neighbour of Mr Watt, Mr Sawyer, came to his place and stayed for a couple of hours.  At about 2.00pm, after Mr Sawyer had gone, the accused drove to Mr Watt's house.  He thought he was drunk, but he was able to speak and walk, though ""wobbly on his feet"".  The accused complained that the deceased would not let him have custody of the girl because he had driven with her in the car whilst he was drunk the previous weekend.  He made some other irrelevant complaints and then drove home.  About an hour or so later, the accused called him and asked ""Do you think I owe you more than you owe me or do you think we're even?"" Mr Watt responded, ""We're probably fairly even"".  The accused then said, ""Well, fuck you. Don't come to my house again.  Don't come here"" and hung up.  Mr Watt said that after the call he drove to the front of his property to close the gate.  As he walked back to the car he heard a gunshot from the direction of the accused's house.  He looked around but could not see anyone and drove back to his house.  This shot, he thought, occurred at about 3.00pm.  Another neighbour of Mr Watt, Mr Ian Browne, came to the house about 3.30pm.  They were having a beer together on the verandah when the accused drove up to the house, driving unusually fast.  The accused came up the stairs to the verandah, shook hands with Mr Browne and said, ""I just shot her three times. Have you got a beer for me?""  Mr Watt told him, ""Fuck off, just fuck off"" and the accused left.  Mr Watt described him as fairly pale and ""slightly"" intoxicated.  He did not think he was over-intoxicated because he spoke clearly and was not walking ""all that bad"" but he thought he had obviously been drinking.   
39In cross-examination Mr Watt agreed that the accused quite often claimed that the deceased was having an affair with different people in the area and, if people spoke to her on the street and complimented her, he would accuse her of having an affair with them.  Mr Watt, when the accused made these claims, tried to persuade him, as I understand it, that this was not so.  Mr Watt said he helped the accused collect firewood and with his fencing and described him as a very helpful fellow when he was not drunk.  However, after he had a few beers to drink, his language became intemperate and, depending on how upset he was, he would make all sorts of random threats against people.  The accused often threatened to commit suicide, saying things like, ""I can't live without her"".  Mr Watt said that after he purchased the blue Ford (sometime after the deceased left him) he would drive to Wingham nearly every day and purchase alcohol and frequently would come and drink some alcohol with Mr Watt on the way home.  At these times he was making increasing threats about killing people, including himself.  It is a little unclear, but as I gathered, during their drinking sessions, which lasted several hours, the accused would usually drink a six pack while Mr Watt would probably drink three beers.    Mr Watt said, ""[The accused] was the sort of bloke that if he had a six pack, he drank a six pack, and if he had a carton, he drank the carton...  He drank every day."" 
40Mr Ian Browne owned a property next to that of Mr Watt.  He first met the accused towards the end of 2009 when he told Mr Browne that his wife had moved to town to stay with her sister.  The second occasion was in late March.  He also met him on other occasions on Mooral Creek Road near Mr Browne's front gate.  On these occasions the accused had a beer in his hand and slurred his speech.  During a conversation at the end of March 2010, after the deceased had left, Mr Browne said the accused spoke aggressively, saying things like, ""What am I supposed to do, the house will be on the market, I will have no where to go"".  He thought the accused was very worried.  On a later occasion Mr Browne went to the accused's house and, when he went inside, noticed seven or eight beer bottles on the floor and the accused very slurry in speech and unsteady on his feet.  
41On 10 July 2010 Mr Browne said that he went to Mr Watt's house at about 3.50pm.  He was on his second beer when the accused turned up, he thought, at about 4.45pm.  He drove up the driveway in his car and then walked up the steps to the verandah.  They greeted each other.  Mr Browne's recollection of what was then said was - 
""he said 'Fred, well have you got a beer for me' and Fred said 'no', and he said 'Well I have just been to town and shot my wife'. He said 'I just shot her three times in the head', and then Fred said 'That's bullshit', and he said 'I did', and then Fred told him to leave, and he turned and he walked past me and he said, 'I did, I did' as he walked down the steps.  Then I lost sight of him getting into his car... Then he drove down the hill at a speed in a sort of a manner that was a bit too fast for the area at the time and went out the gate and never shut the gate and went home.""
Mr Browne told police that when he walked past him on the verandah, ""he was sort of eyes half closed and sort of a glazed look, and his arms were down beside him, walking very just slow and deliberate"".   At about 5.00pm he saw him drive into town. 
42Mr Robert Sawyer lived also in the vicinity of the accused's house.  He thought that he first met the accused in late 2009 on a social occasion and later met the deceased.  He met the accused on quite a few occasions over the next few months.  He was a friend of Mr Watt and often went to his house.  On about three occasions, the accused was also there.  He was told by Mr Watt that the accused and the deceased had separated.  The accused told him on a subsequent occasion how angry he was about the deceased leaving him and having to pay maintenance and child support and then her rent.  He threatened to kill her.  This occurred every time he met the accused after the deceased had left.  Mr Sawyer said, in effect, that did he not take much notice of the accused's complainants and threats because it ""was drunk talk, most of it"".  He said that, when he met the accused, ""he was drunk most of the time"".  He said that in June or July 2010 he saw him at least once a week.  The accused was very drunk on these visits, usually bringing with him a six pack of beer.  Mr Sawyer said that the day before the shooting he saw the accused at his house at about 11.00am.  He was extremely drunk.  The accused complained to him again about having to pay child support and rent and that he wanted to kill the deceased and his daughter.  Mr Sawyer got very upset, remonstrated with him and left.  He said that the accused was drinking but he did not think ""he was that intoxicated"", perhaps half way between completely sober and completely drunk.  He was there for about 10 minutes.  The accused's suggestion that his daughter might not be his child was made only once, which was on the day before the shooting.  About a week before this the accused had come to his house ""quite drunk"" and said the same things about the deceased, but the first time that he mentioned killing his daughter was on the day before the shooting.  Some time before 10 July 2010 the accused told Mr Sawyer that he was going to get a gun and kill the deceased saying that it was a .22-250 which he did not have but he could get access to.
43Another neighbour of the accused, was Ms Shaw who had met the accused and the deceased when they had moved into their property.  Her statement adds little of significance to the issues in the case but she confirmed the chronic drunkenness mentioned by other witnesses.  She was shocked when she heard about the shooting, not having been told about any threats, nor having heard any.  She said that she did not have much to do with the accused because he was always drunk.  The statement of Ms Margaret Wetherall was also tendered by the prosecutor.  
44The police statement of the deceased's father was tendered.  The following relevant paragraph appears in his statement - 
""I have heard [the accused] many times say that he was going to kill people that he had some sort of falling out with over the years that I have known him but it was only ever said when he was drunk and I never believed that he would actually do anything like that.  [The accused] would say that he was going to kill someone for the most minor of things that it would be unbelievable that someone would kill or threaten to kill someone over such minor things.""
The younger brother of the deceased also made a statement to police in which he said that he recalled a night when the family was together that the accused looked at him and said, ""If your sister ever leaves me I will shoot her dead"".  Although the date of this conversation does not appear, it occurred when the deceased was then pregnant and thus took place something like seven years before the offence.  
45Gai Donnelly gave evidence that in July 2010 she was working at a bottle shop in Wingham, having been there for some six years on a casual basis.  She commenced work at about 9.00am on 10 July 2010 when the accused (whom she had seen many times before but whose name she did not know) entered the shop and purchased a six pack of VB stubbies.  His purchases on earlier occasions were similar.  He asked whether anyone had handed in his wallet, which he had lost the previous day (no).  There was some discussion about the change, about which the accused was correct as Ms Donnelly discovered when she made her reconciliations later in the day.  He did not appear to be affected by alcohol.  She said that the accused was a frequent customer, at least a couple of days a week.  
Psychiatric evidence
46The accused's general practitioner, Dr Retnaraja, first saw him in August 2007.  On 15 November 2008 he referred the accused to Dr John Sjostedt, a psychologist, for opinion and management.  The history set out in the referral was - 
""Poor sleep.  Early morning wakening.  Depressed mood.  Low self esteem.  Irrational fear.  No panic attacks.  No compulsive behaviours.  No delusions.  No hallucinations.  No suicidal thoughts.  No substance abuse.""
47In his evidence, Dr Retnaraja said that the depression of which the accused complained was due to a serious injury he suffered to his back in September 1994.  So far as the ""irrational fear"" was concerned, the doctor said that his fear concerned both his finances and his back pain.  Valium was prescribed because of poor sleep and disturbed sleep pattern.  It appears that, although referred to a psychologist, Dr Sjostedt, the accused did not go and he was referred again on 10 May 2010.  The referral letter is somewhat cryptic but, as I understand it, the accused complained that he had been short tempered, which had adversely affected his relationship with his partner (the deceased) leading to them not sleeping in the same room and then a separation since 1 May 2010.  He had been depressed for over 12 months.  The presentation elicited the same matters as mentioned in the earlier referral letter.  A mental assessment tool giving a degree of depression showed that he was quite depressed.  Amongst other medications he was prescribed Valium and Zoloft, an anti-depressive drug.  That drug was first prescribed on 13 January 2010, the date upon which the accused was referred to Dr Koller, a psychiatrist.  It seems that the accused did not attend any appointment with Dr Collard.  The letter of referral noted that there had not been any previous hospital admissions for depression.  On 1 April 2010 the accused again saw Dr Retnaraja who noted that he was ""stressed ++"".  Dr Retnaraja explained this reference meant the accused was distressed because his partner was going to leave him and his daughter would be taken away.  On 24 April 2010 the accused told Dr Retnaraja that the dose of Zoloft previously prescribed was not helping and the doctor increased the prescription to 100 milligrams.  The doctor said that the accused was not suicidal and did not show any behaviour suggesting he might cause harm to any one.  His psychological condition was the same as that previously noted.  Dr Retnaraja said that the accused had never indicated anything to him about his heavy drinking, and the doctor only became aware of this from Dr Sjostedt's report dated 10 June 2010 following an examination of the accused in the previous week.  The doctor did not see any signs of delirium or dementia or any neurological symptoms.  Dr Sjostedt reported the accused's self-scores on the tests he administered were in the extremely severe range for depression, anxiety and stress on a list of 31 negative feelings.  Dr Sjostedt suspected that the scores were an exaggeration of his condition but nevertheless the accused is ""in a very poor state"".  The doctor noted -
""It is my understanding that [the accused] has been a very heavy drinker for a long period of his life, though he stopped for fifteen years a few years back.  He reports that he has been drinking heavily until recently but appears to have stopped, at present.  According to [the accused] he is a very bad drunk but a likeable affable man when sober.""
Dr Sjostedt proposed to treat the accused with several forms of therapy but did not propose any medication.  It is worth noting that Dr Retnaraja who saw the accused on 16 August 2007, 24 October 2008, 15 November 2008, 13 January 2010, 2 February 2010, 2 March 2010, 11 March 2010, 1 April 2010, 24 April 2010, 10 May 2010 and 4 June 2010 and never observed the accused to be intoxicated.
48On 9 November 2011 the accused underwent an MRI brain scan which demonstrated a generalised mild enlargement of the spaces in the brain occupied by cerebrospinal fluid, which was out of keeping with the accused's age.  Several focal infarcts were noted in the basal ganglia and in the right thalamus and the left head of the caudate nucleus whilst small vessel disease was noted throughout the white matter.  The various psychiatrists explained the significance of these findings, to which I come to in due course.  
49Dr Susan Pulman, a neuropsychologist, reported on the results of assessment and tests conducted on 28 June, 28 July and 13 August 2011.  Dr Pulman reported that on the initial visit the accused was difficult to engage in the process of interview and assessment (although this was done at the instance of his lawyers and, presumably to assist him).  Although, at first, the accused said he could not recall events relating to the distant past, after further discussion about the importance of the assessment he cooperated.  Dr Pulman noted that he appeared frustrated with his current situation and, after a short period of testing, the assessment was discontinued as it appeared that the accused was not sufficiently motivated to ensure valid test results.  On the second visit the accused was curt and appeared very agitated and, when the purpose of the visit was explained, he expressed a clear lack of interest in the testing process.  He was uncooperative and disengaged, terminating the testing during the first task, stating it was pointless.  On the third visit, although he presented with a similar lack of interest, he said he would comply with the testing on his solicitor's instructions.  He agreed to try his best but Dr Pulman noted that the testing ""appeared effortful and his level of engagement remained poor"".  He was quick to give up and often responded, ""don't know"".  He was slow to respond.  At the end of the assessment, when asked how he felt he had performed, he said, ""to be honest I don't care"".  Not surprisingly, the test results revealed inconsistencies and variable performance.  Dr Pulman summarised - 
""His current level of intellectual functioning fell within the Borderline range. However, there were several significant differences between the results on various subtests resulting in an invalid interpretation of his full scale IQ.  He performed significantly better on non verbal tests with his performance falling in the Average range.  His performance on various memory tasks was also highly variable ranging from Extremely Low to Low Average.  Basic attention and concentration was Low Average.  Performance on tasks of higher order reasoning was also variable with him giving up on tasks, requiring a discontinuation of the test.  The results of a self-report measure of psychological functioning suggested severe levels of depression, stress and anxiety.
The results of current neuropsychological assessment are on their own difficult to interpret.  However, the findings from tests of effort and motivation are consistent with suboptimal effort and suggest that [the accused] was not performing to the best of his abilities. The results are therefore of questionable validity.""
50I should mention the information provided in the Emergency Department records from Wilcannia Hospital of 18 May 2004, where his was admitted following a serious motor vehicle accident.  These were usefully summarised by Dr Pulman as follows - 
""History from available medical records
Emergency department records from Wilcannia Hospital (18.05.2004) stated that [the accused] was treated at the local police station before being brought to hospital. He appeared ""confused"" and had allegedly been involved in a motor vehicle accident a number of hours earlier.  He was observed to have a bruise on his right temporal lobe and a scratch in his right parietal region.  Blood Saturation Level was 14.8mml.  Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) was 15/15 however notes reported ""patient seems to have altered memory state. Does answer fully to questions asked but gives a different answer when same question is asked. He changes the context of conversation quickly and talks about what is not asked for. Agrees to loss of memory and is being forgetful though well orientated to place, time and person"" (1.45pm, 18.05.2005 [sic]). [The accused] was held overnight for observation before transferred to Broken Hill Base. Brain CT scan (19.05.2004) found no abnormalities. Medical records (dated 19.05.2004) reported that he was still reporting confusion and some loss of memory for the motor vehicle accident. He discharged himself 20.05.2004.
According to a letter from his General Practitioner, Dr Edwin Lee (18.05.2004), [the accused's] medical history included hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, chronic anxiety and alcohol excess.""
51Four psychiatrists were called to give evidence, Professor David Greenberg and Dr Sharon Reutens by the prosecutor and Dr Olav Nielssen and Dr Stephen Allnut by the defence.  It is not necessary to deal with their reports in detail, since their opinions did not substantially differ.  Dr Reutens noted a Minimum Mental State Examination (MMSE) performed on 23 July 2010 scored 24/30.  Scores less than 24 are suggestive of cognitive impairment indicating that on this screening test the accused score was at the borderline of cognitive impairment.  However, this test is, as Dr Reutens said ""a blunt instrument"", noting in particular that so called ""frontal impairment"" - in which judgment and planning are adversely affected - are not demonstrated well in an MMSE and behavioural impairments are not tested.  It is important, therefore, not to ascribe too much significance to this test in light of the MRI's demonstration of frontal lobe damage.  In another test in which the accused participated without reluctance and appeared to give adequate effort, his score indicated a likelihood ratio for dementia of higher than 100:1.  Dr Reutens described the MRI scan as revealing ""cortical and sub-cortical atrophy which was greater than might be expected for his age"" and small vessel disease.  The doctor summarised the position as follows - 
""SUMMARY AND OPINION
[The accused] is a 67 year old gentleman charged with the murder of his wife. He describes depressive symptoms occurring around the time of the incident including a suicide attempt. He described ongoing depressive symptoms at the time of the interview, comprising impaired sleep and appetite, thoughts of death, irritable mood and hopelessness. He has a number of complaints about his physical health and was tearful in the interview. A diagnosis of Major Depressive Episode was considered, however [the accused] enjoys working, his affect was reactive and he stated his symptoms started after the relationship breakdown. A diagnosis of Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood is a more accurate encapsulation of the described symptoms.  An Adjustment Disorder is a reaction to stressors which exceeds a person's coping abilities, resulting in psychiatric symptoms which either significantly impair function or are greater than might be expected as a reaction to the stressor.
[The accused] fulfils DSM-IV-TR criteria for alcohol abuse. He gives a history of a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use which has resulted in legal difficulties and interpersonal problems.
[The accused] further demonstrated cognitive impairments in a number of domains such as memory, language and executive functioning which are consistent with a diagnosis of dementia. In my opinion the cognitive impairment cannot be fully explained by [the accused's] depressive symptoms. The cause of the dementia is likely to have been contributed to by long term hazardous alcohol intake, cerebrovascular disease as demonstrated on his brain MRI, and possible Alzheimer's dementia.""
52Professor Greenberg was retained to assess the accused's fitness to stand trial and whether or not he had a substantial mental impairment which relevantly affected his behaviour.  The former question is moot.  Professor Greenberg noted several occasions on which the accused either declined to continue with the interview or refused to see him at all and on another occasion refused to cooperate with attempts to assess his mental state.  At his initial interview on 15 September 2012 the accused was reasonably cooperative and answered most of the questions although at times he claimed that he had poor memory and could not recall certain details.  When he was questioned about his version of the facts of the alleged offence he only partly cooperated and then stated that he ""had enough"" and did not want to talk anymore.  Again, the accused was initially cooperative on the next day but this deteriorated when the Professor attempted to test his mental state.  When asked about his mental state at the time of the offence, he became agitated and walked out.  He refused to see the Professor when he attended for the third time and, on the fourth and last visit the accused was guarded and irritable and, shortly after the interview commenced, became uncooperative.  The Professor concluded that the accused - 
""had an abnormality of mind at the time of the alleged offence.  He likely had small vessel disease of his brain with resultant old infarct areas of his brain, adjustment disorder with depressed mood, chronic alcoholism, possible cannabis usage and long term effects of valium medication.""
He concluded - and there is no dispute about this - that the accused had the capacity to understand the nature of the events of the day of the offence and the capacity to understand whether his actions were right or wrong.  The accused's capacity to control himself was far more difficult to determine.  There is no doubt that he had brain damage in the frontal area of the brain, which is involved in executive functions, such as judgment and decision-making.  However, attempts by Dr Pulman to quantify any cognitive impairment were unsuccessful because of the accused's poor cooperation with the testing and interviews.  However, one of the tests conducted by Dr Reutens was performed with adequate effort, which confirmed her view that he had cognitive decline.  Professor Greenberg concluded as to this aspect - 
""Given this information, I am of the view that on balance [the accused] likely [has] some memory and some executive dysfunction (early or emerging dementia).  The degree of that impairment is difficult to assess because of his depressed mood, poor frustration tolerance and poor cooperation with psychiatric assessment.   However, overall I am of the view that his mental capacity was relatively intact, based on the witness statements and recordings on triple 000 calls and Police interviews.  Another example of his mental capacity would be evidence... [that, when he purchased liquor on the day of the offence, the accused] was able to recall the amount of money in his wallet, how much he had withdrawn from the bank, how much he had spent and how much he had paid the shop attendant and confront her that he had been given the wrong change.""
53Professor Greenberg concluded that the accused's actions flowed from his feelings of anger and vengeance combined with chronic alcohol usage which was likely a significant disinhibiting factor in his actions during the period, as also was his altercation with the deceased about access to the child.  He noted that there was evidence of forethought of homicide and possibly suicide prior to the offence.  However, the Professor concluded, because of the brain damage demonstrated on the MRI brain scan and his significant Depressed Mood at the time, the accused's capacity to control his actions was impaired.  The extent of this impairment was a question difficult to determine and best left, he said, to the trier of fact.  
54It is, I think, worth noting that the assessment made by Professor Greenberg - indeed by all the doctors - was made about two years after the date in question when, of course, the accused had been abstinent.  As Professor Greenberg agreed, one would expect to see some improvement in his cognition by virtue of that fact.  Accordingly, some adjustment needs to be made for the purpose of assessing his cognitive state at the date of the offence.  Working in the other direction, however, is his dementia, which would have likely progressed in that intermediate period.  Professor Greenberg was cross-examined about the possibility that the slurring by the accused during the triple 0 calls might have been due to a transient ischemic attack but he thought that was a remote possibility because there had been no previous reporting by his doctor as to this matter.  He also relied on a lack of report in this respect by witnesses who had seen him.  However, they were of the view that he was, to a great or lesser extent, intoxicated and may have well regarded any slurring as due to liquor.  It is true that slurring was not particularly mentioned but the possibility of an independent cause, I think, would be most unlikely to have occurred to them.  The lack of any report of slurring, therefore, by the witnesses, is not entitled to the significance to which, it seems, Professor Greenberg attributed to it.   
55Dr Nielssen saw the accused on 12 and 19 July 2012 whilst he was in the psychogeriatric unit of the Metropolitan Special Purpose Centre at Long Bay.  He reported also on the accused's problem with attention, concentration and the orderly retrieval of information, as well as his becoming irritated, venting his anger, and becoming upset in response to obvious difficulties he had in performing screening tests of memory and concentration.  Dr Nielssen concluded - 
""At the time of the offence [the accused] had an abnormality of mind in the form of a state of depression and impairment in intellectual function, arising from his underlying conditions, which were an adjustment disorder and the changes in brain structure and function associated with emerging dementia.  His combination of disorders are likely to have had a significant effect on his perception of events, his ability to judge whether his actions were right or wrong and on his ability to control his actions, in addition to the disinhibiting effect of intoxication with alcohol and possibly benzodiazepine [Valium] medication.""
56The small vessel disease suffered by the accused is multi-infarct dementia or stroke. The doctor's attention was drawn to the fact that, during the second police interview, at a time when he was undoubtedly sober, there was some slurring evident.  Dr Nielssen thought that a possible explanation might be neurological since, for example, slurring is a typical symptom of small infarcts.  On the other hand, the doctor did not notice any slurring or speech impairment in articulation during his interviews, though he did notice some word finding and speech organisation problems, which he thought were of neurological origin.  He pointed out that many people who suffer strokes improve over hours, days and weeks.  (This could explain why, when the accused was interviewed by the various doctors well over a year later, no slurring was observed.)  The doctor said the MRI scan findings were completely consistent with his clinical observations of cognitive impairment and impairments in social judgment.  He pointed out that vascular dementia was different to Alzheimer's in that it worked, as it were, step wise rather than linearly, so that a patient has a little stroke and suddenly it becomes ""a bit worse"".  He pointed out that there had been a brain injury (demonstrated by the Western Australian hospital records) nine years earlier, long standing alcohol abuse and numerous little strokes, so he was ""quite confident there was significant dementia or significant brain pathology evident at the time of the offence"".  The doctor was taken to the MMSE score of 24/30 (with most points lost on orientation and one point lost on attention and concentration) and pointed out that the test of orientation is quite a sensitive one for cognitive problems of memory.  Although it is a screening test, the accused's score would lead him to be ""quite suspicious of underlying dementia"".  
57Dr Allnutt interviewed the accused on 4 October 2013.  He was not cooperative, although he did discuss some aspects of the offence, complaining that the discussion upset him.  Dr Allnutt pointed out that the accused's poor engagement in testing could be attributable to his Neurocognitive Disorder (Dementia) and Depression, noting not only what was said in other reports but the evidence of structural damage consistent with dementia on the MRI scans.  Dr Allnutt concluded that the accused suffered from Vascular Dementia with Alzheimer's subtype as a differential diagnosis.  Given his present symptoms, Dr Allnutt thought it reasonable to conclude that, at the time of the offence, he was manifesting early signs of Mild vVscular Neurocognitive Disorder and that erosion of his cognitive facilities was already occurring, although he accepted that this was a difficult determination to make in retrospect.  Based on the conclusion that the accused was manifesting cognitive decline at the time of the offence it would, the doctor thought, also be reasonable to accept that those difficulties probably related to executive functioning.  The doctor said that Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder need not manifest in the form of obvious memory impairment and can manifest in the form of executive dysfunction and poor social judgment characterised by disinhibition, a reduced capacity for personal restraint and inappropriate social behaviour.  In this event, he would have been finding it difficult to organise and plan, which would have increased his reliance on the victim and added to feelings of loss and anger at her absence, together with the multiple losses he experienced leading up the offence including the belief that his partner was having an affair with other men, thus contributing to the emergence of depressive symptoms which appeared to have been active at the material time.  Depression tends to aggravate the negative perception of one's self, others and one's environment and can compound underlying feelings of irritability and anger and generate aggression.  In summary, Dr Allnutt thought that at the material time the accused was, on balance, experiencing the underlying condition of Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder secondary to multiple medical conditions and chronic alcohol abuse and a Depressive Episode.  The underlying condition did not cause an abnormality of mind of the nature and severity that it impacted on his capacity to understand events or his capacity to judge right from wrong.  As to the capacity to control his actions, this was difficult to determine because of the time that had elapsed since the offence, during which the accused's mental state had deteriorated, as well as inadequate performance on neuropsychological testing.  In this context, if his alcohol and diazepam blood levels were inconsistent with intoxication at the time of the offence, then his slurred speech needed an explanation, most likely the underlying Neurocognitive Disorder and the aggravating effect of even low blood levels of alcohol and diazepam on his cognitive functioning.  The doctor considered that, if it were accepted that the accused had Mild Vascular Neurocognitive Disorder manifesting with early executive cognitive decline at the material time, then it was possible to infer that he was experiencing erosion of his executive functions and would have been less capable of exerting cognitive inhibition when experiencing high levels of emotion such as anger or stress and probably cognitive inflexibility as well.  In sum, there was no doubt that he was feeling anger and depression which had been present for a considerable period of time, that there was probably a trigger in the earlier conversation with the deceased but, in choosing his course of action, he was less capable in a real sense, due to his Neurocognitive Disorder causing executive dysfunction to apply inhibition as a normal person would have. 
58The reports of the Mental Health Review Tribunal on the accused's fitness to plead were also tendered, but they add nothing of significance to the above material. 
59It is undisputed that the accused, at the time of the killing, suffered both from brain damage and either depression or a depressed mood, each of which is, undoubtedly, ""an underlying condition"".  To satisfy the first condition imposed by s 23A(1)(a), the impairment must be more than trivial or minimal.  The measure is essentially incommensurable.  There is no point in multiplying adjectives though, perhaps, a useful synonym is ""significant"".  At all events, my own judgment, informed of course by the medical evidence, is that more probably than not the condition specified in s 23A(1)(a) has been satisfied in that, at the time of shooting the deceased, the accused's executive function and judgment and capacity to control himself were substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition within the meaning of the paragraph.  I deal with the question whether this impairment was so substantial as to warrant his liability for murder being reduced to manslaughter after considering further matters.  
Intoxication 
60Section 23A(3) of the Act provides that the effects of self-induced intoxication are to be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether, in accordance with the section, murder is justifiably reduced to manslaughter.  Evidence was called from Dr Judith Perl, a forensic pharmacologist with the Clinical Forensic Medicine Unit at the Sydney Police Centre.  She noted the blood sample taken from the accused at 12.50am on 11 July 2010 contained diazepam and nordiazepam but no alcohol.  She (accurately) summarised the evidence as to drinking as follows: the witnesses said the accused was seen to be drinking from a can of mid-strength beer between 9.00am and 11.00am, a stubby of full-strength beer at around 11.00am and had opened a can of pre-mixed bourbon around 11.30am and had a can in his hand around 1.00pm whilst, after the shots were heard, he was seen sitting on the verandah drinking from a can.  Whilst he was being pursued by police he had a drink from a VB stubby which was found partly empty on the seat.  He stated to the triple 0 operator that he had had about half a dozen beers and told a police officer he drank two stubbies of VB after the incident.  Dr Perl concluded that this information, including the observations made by his neighbours indicated that at the time of the incident the accused had a positive blood alcohol concentration, but it was highly unlikely that this was so significant as to affect his memory or reasoning or render him incapable of making decisions and carrying them out.  Dr Perl thought that the blood concentrations of diazepam and nordiazepam were consistent with the accused's daily use as prescribed and with his having taken it around 7.00am, as he had stated.  Dr Perl listened to the two triple 0 calls and watched the interview conducted with the accused at 10.00pm and also the forensic procedure conducted at 12.50am the following morning.  She noted that the accused appeared to have some impairment of speech which sounded like slurring but his responses were not unusually delayed, as one might expect in a significantly intoxicated person, nor was his speech significantly slurred, as one might expect in an intoxicated person.  Furthermore, his movements were not obviously impaired and his responses were appropriate and lucid.  Dr Perl said that the accused appeared to her to be much the same throughout the period from his first triple 0 call to the time the blood sample was taken.  Indeed, this is my own impression of those conversations, at least up to the second interview which commenced at 10.00pm.  
61Dr Perl's opinion was directed to whether the accused might have been so intoxicated at the time of the incident to have rendered him unable to make decisions and carry them out and rightly concluded that this was not the case.  However, once one disregards the slurring, his mode of speech, coherence and lucidity at the time in particular of the triple 0 calls not only do not show intoxication but, to my mind, justify the conclusion that, more probably than not he was not significantly intoxicated at the time of shooting, although he may have had a number of drinks earlier in the day.  It may be, of course, that he was somewhat intoxicated by the time he was observed by police at the point of his arrest and by Mr Blick when he had been brought to the police station but I accept his account of drinking following the incident.  I note also that, having bought a six pack at about 9.00am in the morning, the police located unopened stubbies in his car when he was arrested.  The fact that there was no improvement discernible in his mode of speech between the time of the triple 0 calls (when the state of his intoxication is unknown) and the time of his interview at 10.00pm (when he was certainly sober) is to my mind a significant indicator that on the earlier occasions he was also not intoxicated.  That history leads me to conclude that it is most likely that the slurring was due to a temporary stroke.  I am satisfied that, more probably than not, even if alcohol was in his bloodstream at the time of the offence, he was not intoxicated within the meaning of s 23A(3) of the Act.   
Provocation 
62Mr Ramage QC, counsel for the accused, has submitted that I should find that the prosecution has not disproved the reasonable possibility that the accused acted under provocation at the time of his shooting of the deceased.  The prosecution (rightly) did not seek to submit that the issue of provocation had not been raised but, rather, submitted that there was no reasonable possibility that the accused acted under provocation within the meaning of s 23 of the Act.  The act causing death is an act done under provocation where -  (i)the act or omission is the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the accused that was induced by any conduct of the deceased (including grossly insulting words or gestures) towards or affecting him, and
(ii)the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill, or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon, the deceased.
It matters not whether the conduct of the deceased which induced the accused to kill her occurred immediately before he did so or at any previous time.  
63Here, it is not suggested that the claimed provocative conduct was confined to what was said in the telephone conversations on the morning of 10 July 2010 or the later conversation that may have occurred immediately before the shooting but, as I understand it, on the accumulated behaviour of the deceased towards the accused, including her relationship with Mr Watt and the suggestion made by the deceased that their daughter was not his child, which had particular point in the context of demands made that he should pay maintenance which must have included, of course, the support for the girl he believed was his daughter.  Of course, in no sense could the killing of the deceased be regarded as proportional to the provocation, if any, offered but this is not a necessary condition of the defence.  It only necessary that the provocation might possibly have induced an ordinary person to have formed the intent to kill.  Nor is it necessary that such an ordinary person would have been induced to commit the actual killing as distinct from having an intent to kill.  
64Aside from the material to which I have already referred, from the accused's neighbours and what he said to the triple 0 operators and the police officers, the accused gave accounts to the assessing psychiatrists.  It was not submitted by the prosecution that these accounts were not admissible as to their truth.  Rather, it was submitted, that I would be sceptical about the weight which should be attributed to them, considering that they differed in a number of respects from what the accused himself had earlier said.  Furthermore, they were given after significant delays (the earliest in July 2012) with the attendant risks not only of confabulation and confusion but of reconstructing events for reasons of self-justification.  It is reasonable to bear these considerations in mind.  I note that the accused's accounts are inconsistent in some respects as to matters which are not, of themselves, significant in terms of his state of mind at the time of the killing.  In my view the inconsistencies more likely reflect a combination of the ordinary failures of human recollection combined with his increasing dementia, rather than any attempt to create a defence.  The following accounts focus on the events on or shortly before 10 July 2010 as related to the psychiatrists.  
65To Dr Nielssen, the accused said that the incident stemmed from arguments over his wish to see their daughter.  He said that the deceased telephoned him on the morning of 10 July 2010 about this matter in which she told him, ""It's not your child anyway"".  He said that he felt ""wild"" when she did not allow him to see the child as previously arranged although she later rang him back and told him that he could come and collect her.  He said that he had planned to take his rifle to a paddock across the road and ""take it out on some shooting"".  He said he remembered wanting to adjust the rifle sights.  He said that he had no memory of the actual offence or of the conversations he had before or after it, the circumstances of his arrest or of participating in an electronically recorded interview.  He said that, having read the brief of evidence and the autopsy report, he accepted that he had shot the deceased at close range with the rifle saying, ""it was my car there it was my gun it must have been me but I don't remember any of it"".  He said that he had no memory of the thoughts going through his mind or of having planned to shoot her or shoot himself at any stage.  He told Dr Nielssen about the other issues that had upset him, namely the deceased leaving him and asking for half of the property including her selling a horse he bought for their daughter.  He was also upset that he had arranged for her to receive a carer's pension to look after him but she had not provided him with any care, instead taking a job on an avocado farm.  He was mainly upset, however, because the deceased was inconsistent in allowing him access to the child.  As to his state of mind about the time of the offence, the accused said that he remembered feeling depressed and as though his life was over and that, about a week before, he had attempted suicide by deliberately running his truck off the road but it had become jammed in gum trees and he emerged unscathed, though the truck was written off.  (That he had in fact driven off the road down a steep embankment and the vehicle was jammed in some trees was confirmed by witnesses.  However, it actually occurred about six weeks before the shooting.)  
66Dr Reutens saw the accused on 30 August 2012.  Amongst other things, he told her that he asked the deceased to leave because he believed she was having an affair with their neighbour and said that their daughter had told him that she had witnessed the deceased kissing the neighbour.  The accused said, ""I reckon she slept with a lot of people"".  He confronted her, asked her to leave and assisted her to move to Wingham.  He said he had access to his daughter every weekend.  His alcohol intake increased after the deceased left but he was unable to quantify the amount.  The accused told Dr Reutens that, in addition to the suspected affair, he was angry with the deceased because of her financial demands.  He was unhappy with her decision to sell two horses and annoyed that her family had stayed with them for some months.  He said that, on the day of the incident, he had expected his daughter to stay overnight but that the deceased telephoned him that day to say that she could not stay overnight because he had been drunk the last time she stayed over, the week before, and they had an argument.  The accused said he was annoyed about this.  The journey between his house and the deceased's was 25 minutes one way and he did not want to have to pick up his daughter up and drop her off as that would be an hour's trip each time.  He said that he planned to go shooting and that is why he had the gun in the car.  He drove to the deceased's house where they had an argument and she said words to the effect, ""who said it was your baby?"" and he picked up the gun and shot her.  He said that he had drunk alcohol and consumed Valium that day but could not remember any quantities.  He gave an account of being depressed after the separation and trying to kill himself by crashing a vehicle.  
67Professor Greenberg saw the accused in September 2012.  Amongst other things, he told him the deceased was having an affair with a neighbour and that she and this neighbour were growing cannabis together.  He said that approximately 18 months prior to the alleged offence he tried to kill himself by crashing his truck.  The accused told Professor Greenberg that, when the deceased called him in the morning of 10 July 2010, she asked him if he was going to pick up the ""baby"" and he said that he would be there in half an hour but that after he arrived she told him that he could not have her and accused him of drinking alcohol.  She said that the baby was bathed and he could not take the baby with him anymore.  He said that he swore at her and went home.  He said that he was going across the road to do some shooting with his rifle when the deceased rang and apologised for what had happened.  He said that he then put the gun in the car and went back to the deceased's house.  When he arrived at the house and asked her where the baby was, she said ""what baby?""  He confronted her for having made him drive so many kilometres and yet the baby was not there.  At this point, the accused said that he should not be talking to the Professor because ""this was another version of the facts"".  After an explanation about the purpose of the assessment the Professor asked the accused what he was thinking of at the time when he returned to the deceased's house.  The accused said that he was not sure what he was thinking that day.  He said that the deceased said to him, ""Who said that the baby's yours"".  He said that he thought she had been ""'milking him for money' for the past seven or eight years"".  He said that he did not have any memory of what happened after that point in time although he was aware that his partner was shot having read it in the autopsy report.  He said he could not recall shooting her.  When asked why he thought he had reportedly shot the deceased he stated that after she had ""screwed the neighbour"" he had lost two houses and posed the question ""What would I do?""  At that point he said that the Professor had upset him and left the room.  Two weeks later Professor Greenberg again saw the accused and, amongst other things, asked him again about the events of 10 July 2010.  The accused told him that he returned a second time to the deceased's house because she called and said that he could now have the ""baby"".  He had taken the rifle out of the bedroom and was going across the road to do some shooting when she called.  He said that he drove to the deceased's and asked for the child but she said, ""who said it's your kid anyway"", so he went to the car and, seeing the rifle there, ""I picked it up.  Thought I'd scare the bitch.  Anyway I don't remember anything after that"".  In effect, he denied having threatened to kill the deceased before the day of the shooting.  He said that the deceased was having an affair with Mr Watt, which he had known about ""for quite a while"", but could not give a timeline.  He then declined to answer any further questions about his mental state or behaviour and the interview was abruptly terminated. 
68I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, when the accused left his home to travel to Wingham with the rifle in the motor vehicle he had it in mind to kill the deceased.  It is clear that the notion of killing the deceased had been present in his mind for a significant period (after she left him and before 10 July 2010) although maybe he did not actually decide to do so until that day.  Having regard particularly to what he said to his neighbours on the morning of 10 July 2010, it is impossible to accept that the rifle was in the car accidentally.  It may be he had not made a final decision to shoot the deceased at that point, since when he reached the house and walked onto the verandah, he did not have the rifle with him.  However that may be, after the exchange (which I accept then occurred) his decision to kill the deceased crystallised if it had not already done so.  He fired a number of shots which, although in quick succession, required him to manipulate the bolt on the rifle each time.  He gave an explanation of what had happened and why it had happened to the triple 0 operators shortly after the event.  His explanation for his actions was inconsistent with a loss of self-control as was the justification in effect, that he had no choice but to do what he did.  
69Accordingly, although I would accept that it is reasonably possible that the accused's shooting of the deceased was a reaction to her conduct, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had not lost his self-control.  It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider the second limb of the defence, which the prosecutor was required otherwise to disprove and therefore whether the conduct of the deceased was such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the accused to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intent to kill her.  
70In fairness, I should point out that, in describing the conduct of the deceased from the accused's point of view, I do not suggest in any way that she had acted wrongly, improperly or, for that matter, unfairly towards the accused.
Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind
71Section 23A(1) provides for two conditions that must be met before liability for murder can be reduced to manslaughter under this head.  As previously stated, the first requirement has been satisfied.  The remaining question is whether that impairment warrants a finding of manslaughter rather than murder - the other elements of murder being satisfied.  This is, of course, not a medical question but an evaluative one requiring a realistic and common sense view of the extent to which the accused's impairment of mind affected his moral or criminal culpability.  Put another way, the question involves considering the extent to which, because of his mental impairments, the accused was answerable for what he did including, of course, the intention with which he did it.  It is not a matter for nice analysis but for judgment, considering all the relevant facts surrounding the offence, the motivations and feelings of the accused and, of course, his mental impairment.  
72In the result, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused's impairments did so significantly affect his judgment, in particular (but not exclusively) his ability to control his actions and his deciding to shoot the deceased.  The requirement of s 23A(1)(b) is therefore satisfied.
Conclusion
73The appropriate finding is that the accused on the limited evidence available, is not guilty of murder but is guilty of manslaughter.

2705802,Kassis v R [2013] NSWCCA 298,"JUDGMENT


	
	HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Blanch J and the order which he proposes.
	
	
	BLANCH J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 8 February 2013. On 1 February 2013 he confirmed his pleas of guilty made in the Local Court to two counts:
	


Count 1: Supply prohibited drug (24.6 grams of cocaine) on 15 March 2012 contrary to s 25(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which carries a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.

Count 2: Supply large commercial quantity of prohibited drug (997.5 grams of ecstasy) on 15 March 2012 contrary to s 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 which carries a maximum penalty of life and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.


	
	When being sentenced on Count 2 he asked for two matters to be taken into account on the Form 1. The first was Dealing with suspected proceeds of crime ($32,000 in cash) between 15 March 2012 and 20 March 2012 contrary to s 193C(2) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment. The second offence was Possess prohibited restricted substance (22 tablets of Theophylline) on 15 March 2012 contrary to s 16(1) Poisons and Therapeutic Goods Act 1966 which carries a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment.
	
	
	On Count 1 he was sentenced to a fixed term of 15 months imprisonment to commence on 20 March 2012 and expiring on 15 June 2013.
	
	
	On Count 2 he was sentenced to 8 years 6 months commencing 20 September 2012 and expiring on 19 March 2021. A non-parole period was specified of 5 years from 20 September 2012 and expiring on 19 September 2017.
	
	
	The total sentence was thus one of 9 years imprisonment from 20 March 2012 with a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months.
	
	
	The ground of appeal argued is ""Her Honour erred by failing to properly take into account the applicant's plea of guilty.""
	


FACTS


	
	On 24 February 2012 the applicant and his partner, the co-offender in the first offence, Ms Goff leased a one bedroom unit located at 1/522 Military Road, Mosman. Lawfully intercepted telephone calls alerted police to suspect activities relating to drugs. On 15 March investigators executed a covert search warrant at the unit when the occupants were absent. In a bedside drawer they found three plastic bags containing powder believed to be drugs and another bag with two ecstasy tablets in it. They also found $8,000 in cash and they seized these items. In a hallway cupboard they found a gift bag and inside it was a vacuum sealed plastic bag which contained 995 grams of ecstasy with a drug purity of 82.5 per cent. They also seized this property.
	
	
	When the applicant came home he noticed property was missing and there were intercepted telephone calls between him and Ms Goff. There was also a telephone call to Mr Cretan relating to the missing drugs. On 20 March 2012 investigators went to the home of Mr Cretan and located two pill presses commonly used to manufacture ecstasy, 12 stamps also used in that process and a quantity of precursor chemicals used to make ecstasy. A search of the applicant's home at Caringbah located $24,000 in cash concealed in a tissue box and a plastic bag containing traces of cocaine. They also found 22 tablets of Theophylline in a motor vehicle used by the applicant. He was arrested during the search. At the Mosman unit investigators seized scales and a small plastic resealable bag containing 19 grams of methylamphetamine.
	
	
	The evidence was that the ecstasy powder seized could make approximately 4 kilograms of pills at 20 per cent purity. This equates to a wholesale value of between $88,000 and $143,000 and at street level a value of between $222,000 and $440,000.
	
	
	The sentencing judge concluded ""On these facts it is not possible to determine the precise role of the offender in these two offences, other than to describe him as being the person who stored the drugs, which ... were to be made into ecstasy tablets.""
	


THE APPLICANT'S SUBMISSION


	
	The applicant submits the sentencing judge did not say she had taken the plea of guilty into consideration when passing sentence. That is an accurate assessment of her Honour's remarks on sentence although she began her remarks by stating ""The offender, David Michael Kassis, pleaded guilty in the Local Court and maintained those pleas in this Court to two charges."" Counsel on behalf of the applicant refers to the case of R v Thomson and Houlton(2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at [160] where Spigelman CJ said:
	


""A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight.""


	
	It is accepted on behalf of the applicant that failure to quantify the discount or sometimes to mention the discount at all (see for example R v Lawrence[2005] NSWCCA 91) does not by itself establish error. The argument advanced here is that the sentence itself demonstrates that her Honour did not discount the sentence.
	


DETERMINATION


	
	It is clear that the question of a discount was raised in the sentencing proceedings. The Crown stated in the sentencing proceedings:
	


""I should note, your Honour, that the Crown accepts in relation to both matters we accept there is a 25% utilitarian discount on the plea of guilty.""


	
	In those circumstances it is difficult to conclude that a very experienced judge would have overlooked the significance of the plea of guilty and ignored the concession made by the Crown. Particularly is that so when it is accepted the sentence is within the broad range of an appropriate sentence for these offences.
	
	
	In order to determine whether the discount, accepted to be 25 per cent, has been overlooked it is necessary to review the sentences imposed. The total sentence is one of 9 years, which might indicate a starting point of 12 years reduced by a 25 per cent discount. That 12 years has to be considered against a possible maximum penalty of life imprisonment for the second offence and a standard non-parole period of 15 years and also a maximum penalty of 15 years for the first offence. As between the two offences, there has been only a slight accumulation of 6 months.
	
	
	Subjectively at the time of sentence he was 29 with no prior criminal history. He was educated to year 12 and then did a 4 year electrical trade apprenticeship and in each year was nominated for Australian Apprentice of the Year. He was a talented footballer who played for Australia in the under 21 team when aged 16. When he was 25 he was to be married but the wedding was called off when he discovered his partner was being unfaithful. At that stage he began using drugs and his life deteriorated. This might explain why he became involved in the drug traffic. On the other hand, the psychologist report and the Probation and Parole report were positive and indicated he understood the need to avoid drugs.
	
	
	The facts of the case clearly indicate the offences relate to a significant amount of drugs worth a significant amount of money. It is clear the applicant was involved in the process of distributing the drugs into the community and he was in possession of a significant amount of money which he acknowledged was suspected proceeds of crime. There is a need for general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence for this criminality even in the case of a person aged 29 years of age with no prior criminal history. It is important that drug dealers understand there is a real price to pay if they are convicted. In view of the amount of drug involved in this case, I am not of the view that a starting point of 12 years as a total sentence was wrong. Accordingly, I believe the sentencing judge did in fact apply a 25 per cent discount to arrive at a total sentence of 9 years.
	
	
	Another way of testing the proposition is to assume the judge forgot to apply a 25 per cent discount. The sentence would then become a head sentence of 9 years reduced to one of 6 years and 10 months with a non-parole period at a similar ratio as applied by the judge of just over 4 years. Such a sentence in my view would be manifestly inadequate for this offence. That also clearly indicates the judge did not neglect to discount the sentence for the plea in an appropriate manner.
	
	
	At the end of the day no other less severe sentence than that imposed is warranted in law - see s 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.
	
	
	I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.
	
	
	PRICE J: I agree with Blanch J.

		16 February 2016",2013-11-27 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705808,Facer v Wolfe [2013] NSWDC 231,"Judgment
1These proceedings were listed before me today for hearing. I set out my reasons for adjourning the hearing, as reflected in the orders set out below.
2The plaintiff commenced proceedings for defamation after the defendant sent an email on 28 February 2011 to five fellow management committee members for the strata title company which ran the home unit block in which they resided. A claim for republication to another resident in the block of flats (relevant to damages only) is also made. The matter complained of was one of a series of emails between the members about delays in obtaining access to the financial records for the body corporate from the defendant. The subject matter was ""Inspection of the books for SP17382"" and the contents of the email were as follows:
""I am most concerned by the actions of the Strata Manager regarding access to our financial records.
If we do not have our financial records by email as proposed, I suggest we simply refer the matter to Moss Vale Police to investigate as embezzlement.
Stephen and I will not waste a day travelling to Moss Vale tomorrow.""
3The imputations pleaded in the statement of claim filed on 13 July 2011, are:
(a)The plaintiff is an embezzler;
(b)The plaintiff so conducted his business, Highland Strata, as to warrant his being referred to Moss Vale Police to be investigated for embezzlement.
A third imputation was struck out in an imputations argument on 2 March 2012. 
4The defendant, who has been represented from time to time by legal practitioners but is effectively a litigant in person, sought an adjournment after being served, because she had been diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo treatment. In a letter dated 28 September 2011, the solicitors for the plaintiff sought a report from her treating oncologist to confirm the treatment she was to undergo and to indicate whether the oncologist believed that the treatment would prevent the defendant from instructing a solicitor as claimed. Mr Weaver told me, from the bar table, that this report was provided, and that the defendant's health problems had resulted in very little activity taking place between the two mediations held in this matter (on 7 May 2012 and 25 March 2013).
5The defendant did, however, file a defence on 13 December 2011. That defence is poorly drafted and does not refer to any of the usual defences but, significantly from the point of view of an assessment of damages, identifies an apology the defendant sent on 27 March 2011 (five days after receiving a request for an apology) and a statement that she had resigned from the executive committee of the body corporate for this reason. A number of body corporate emails and other documents are attached. Notwithstanding these defects, and perhaps also because of the plaintiff's ongoing health problems, no challenge was made to this defence.
6On 11 April 2013, after the second mediation failed, the defendant filed an amended defence. This was a slight improvement on the previous defence, in that it referred to the defences of qualified privilege, justification and contextual justification, honest opinion and unlikelihood of harm. It did not provide particulars for these defences.
7This was the defence before the court on 12 April 2013, when orders were made by consent for the plaintiff to seek further particulars of the defence by 26 April 2013 and for the defendant to reply by 10 May 2013, as well as for further orders, including standing the matter over to 28 June 2013.
8The plaintiff did not seek these particulars by 26 April 2013, or indeed take any other steps to make the matter ready for hearing, until 12 June 2013, when the plaintiff's solicitors sent the defendant a letter complaining about the inadequacy of the defence (principally absence of particulars), demanding that these particulars to be answered by 25 June 2013. If those particulars were not answered, the letter warned that the plaintiff would ""seek to have the defence struck out and proceed to summary judgment"".
9The reasons for the minatory tone of this proposal are unclear. The defendant had filed a similar defence 18 months beforehand, to which no objection had been taken, and there was no prior history of non-compliance. The complaint was that the plaintiff had not provided particulars under Part 15 rr 15.22 to 15.30 Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) for the defences, or identified whether the comment and qualified privilege defences were also pleaded at common law. Some of the complaints are unmeritorious; for example, it is not necessary to plead additional contextual imputations if this defence is limited to the truth of one or more of the imputations pleaded by the plaintiff, nor is it necessary to provide anything other than the most general particulars of the defence of unlikelihood of harm (particulars are generally provided by the formulaic statement that the defendant relies upon the circumstances in which the claim was made.)
10As noted, the letter states that if the defendant will provide these particulars by the date nominated by the plaintiff, the plaintiff would be happy to mention the matter on 28 June 2013 and have the timetable ""extended by consent""; however, if the particulars are not provided, then summary judgment will be sought. However, it was not the fault of the defendant that the timetable was in arrears. This was wholly the fault of the plaintiff, who had not sought any particulars of the defence by the due date of 26 April 2013, or filed a Reply by 17 May 2013, or provided discovery or interrogated by the respective dates of 10 May and 14 June 2013. All the plaintiff had done was to send a generalised complaint about the adequacy of the defence which, rather than amounting to particulars, would have required the filing of an amended defence. This was well outside the parameters of the timetable and contrary to the fresh step rule.
11On 28 June 2013 the plaintiff sought orders to strike out the defence. The defendant was in court. This was the last time she attended court. According to Mr Weaver, it was at about this time that the defendant may have told the plaintiff's solicitor that she would be overseas. If so, that would explain the reference in her email of 21 November 2013 to ""as already advised"" when stating that she would be away until December 30 2013.
12The plaintiff's notice of motion to strike out the defence was filed and served on the defendant, who acknowledged receipt. She did not attend court on 9 August 2013, when the defence was struck out, and should be taken to know that this was very likely to happen if she did not attend. The defendant was served with a copy of the orders made, which included an order that the matter was stood over to the defamation list on 23 August 2013 on which date ""the defendant is to provide any reason why Summary Judgment should not be entered"". There could be no doubt the defendant knew her defence was struck out and would have been aware that a summary judgment application was going to be made on 23 August 2013, although this date, and the final nature of the relief sought by the plaintiff, were not referred to in the covering letter, which was of the ""we enclose"" style of correspondence.
13The plaintiff's application for summary judgment was the only matter in the defamation list before Levy SC DCJ on 23 August 2013, according to Mr Weaver. The defendant was called three times outside the court and did not appear. The orders made were:
(1)Summary judgment entered against the defendant.
(2)The matter is set down for assessment hearing at 10.00 am on 28 November 2013 (with an estimate of up to 2 hours);
(3)The defendant is to pay the plaintiff's costs of the application for summary judgment.
14It is as a result of these orders that these proceedings are listed before me today for hearing.
15No order was made by Levy SC DCJ for service of his orders of 23 August 2013 on the defendant. Mr Weaver put to me that no order was made because Levy SC DCJ did not consider it to be necessary for the defendant to be informed. The defendant had not attended court on the summary judgment application, and had either waived her right to further notification about the proceedings, or shown a sufficient lack of interest to warrant the case proceeding to assessment without her being informed of the hearing date.
16Mr Weaver told me that it was only ""for more abundant caution"" that his instructing solicitor on 19 November 2013 emailed and posted a ""we enclose"" letter to the defendant advising of the orders made by Levy SC DCJ, including the hearing date. This produced two results. The first was that the plaintiff sent an email in reply stating ""As advised previously, I return to Australia on 30 December "" (affidavit of R A Reading, Exhibit I). The second was that, after Mr Reading swore this affidavit on 21 November 2013, the defendant's sister telephoned him to tell him that the defendant was overseas until 30 December 2013.
The plaintiff seeks to go ahead with the hearing
17The plaintiff opposed the adjournment of the hearing on three bases:
(a)The plaintiff was not ordered to notify the defendant of the hearing date, and has given sufficient notice of it by sending a letter and email on 19 November 2013;
(b)These proceedings have already taken two and a half years to come to court, in circumstances where the defendant has stood idly by while judgment was entered against her; and
(c)The plaintiff is ready to proceed today and should be permitted to do so.
18Mr Weaver submitted his client was ready to proceed and had come to court with his witnesses and written submissions. His client had not been ordered to advise the defendant of the hearing date, and the defendant's response that she was overseas until 30 December 2013 amounted to ""cocking a snook"" at the plaintiff's action. I shall consider each of the matters he raised in turn.
The obligation to notify the defendant of the hearing date
19If Levy SC DCJ had ordered the plaintiff to notify the defendant and this had not been done, it would have been inappropriate for the hearing to take place.
20His Honour was entitled to take for granted that the defendant would be notified within a reasonable time. The hearing was three months away and there would be plenty of time for the defendant to advise if there were problems with the date selected.
21In the absence of a judgment on the issue, I do not consider that his Honour dispensed with service on the defendant of the orders or of notification of the defendant. Complaints that an order should have been made are a counsel of perfection.
22The defendant should have been notified promptly of the orders of 23 August 2013. A letter and email sent the week before the hearing would be insufficient, whether or not the solicitor for the plaintiff knew of the defendant's likely absence overseas.
The defendant's inactivity and failure to appear when her defence was struck out
23This was the principal basis upon which Mr Weaver submitted that the hearing should proceed as otherwise his client would suffer the prejudice of further delay. 
24Mr Weaver pointed out that these proceedings had taken two and a half years to get to court. He identified delays by the defendant in retaining a solicitor (a delay of about three weeks) and in relation to the mediation, but acknowledged that these delays occurred in the context of the defendant being treated for cancer.
25The defendant did not indulge in delay in the form of failure to comply with court orders. There was an imputation argument where a costs order was made, but that is a standard part of defamation proceedings. The only other costs orders I can find in relation to the mediation are costs orders made (and then vacated) by Gibb DCJ on 8 and 15 June in favour of the defendant, not the plaintiff. The first mediation was unsuccessful, and one of the complaints of the defendant was that the plaintiff did not appear in person but by telephone. A further mediation order was made, but this mediation was also unsuccessful.
26Mr Weaver complained that the solicitors for the defendant sought adjournments while they investigated whether the defendant's email was written on an occasion falling within the body corporate insurance. This included vacating a mediation date (8 October 2012) so that the question of indemnity from the body corporate could be pursued. The ""duty to defend"" principles of indemnity under an insurance contract for homeowners sued for defamation have been the subject of discussion in caselaw both in Australia (Knapp v Hinchcliffe [2004] QSC 326) and overseas (Hodgkinson v. Economical Mutual Insurance Company [2003] O.J. No. 5125 (C.A.)), and the existence of such insurance may be relevant not only to the defence, but to the plaintiff's claims (Knapp at [5] - [7]; Hickie v Perkins (Supreme Court of NSW, Levine J, 15 November 1996)).  I regard this as a legitimate inquiry and not as time-wasting.
27Mr Weaver relied in particular upon the failure to answer a request for particulars which led to the striking out of the defendant's defence, with a costs order against her, as well as her failure to attend court on 9 and 23 August. I have taken this into account. The striking out of the defendant's defence occurred, however, after she was given only one opportunity to provide particulars, in circumstances where the plaintiff had allowed the time for seeking particulars to elapse (but cf Ford v Nagle [2004] NSWCA 33, Ahmed v John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 6 and Hallam v Ross [2011] QCA 274) and these orders have been given full weight by me in coming to my determination. 
28I cannot identify substantial, or indeed minor, inactivity or failure to appear by the defendant, other than the failure to answer the particulars of 12 June 2013 and her subsequent non-appearance on the applications to strike out and for summary judgment on 9 and 23 August 2013. The plaintiff's delay in seeking particulars between 26 April (the final date given by the court) and 12 June (the date these particulars were sought) is unexplained. 
29The plaintiff's delay and failure to comply with orders is thus limited to her failure to attend court or to comply with the request for particulars made on 12 June 2013, namely between 28 June 2013 (when the application was made to the court for the defence to be struck out on this basis) and 23 August 2013 (when Levy SC DCJ entered summary judgment and listed the matter for hearing on 28 November 2013). This does not necessarily mean that she does not wish to be heard on the subject of quantum, particularly in circumstances where, as she recites in her defences, she has published an apology. Nor would her failure to attend on these occasions mean she had lost the right to be told about the hearing date with due notice, particularly in circumstances where it would appear that she had previously advised the solicitor for the plaintiff, in about June 2013, that she would be absent from Australia until December 2013.
30While two and a half years to get to hearing is a considerable period of time, the delays in this case should not be laid at the foot of the defendant. A further delay of several months in order to enable the defendant to prepare her case on quantum, or to take such other steps as she may be advised, is delay sounding essentially in costs, and I have made an order reserving the costs of today to preserve the entitlement of both parties on this issue.  
The hearing is ready to proceed 
31The next basis upon which Mr Weaver submitted that the matter should proceed was that the plaintiff was ready for hearing, in that he had assembled his witnesses and written submissions had been provided to the court.
32These written submissions do not refer to the uniform legislation in place since the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) or to any damages awards made in accordance with the provisions of that legislation, which is akin to making submissions in a negligence action without referring to the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW). To the contrary of those statutory provisions, these written submissions state (at paragraph 13) that defamation damages are ""at large"", which is a misstatement of the law even under the repealed legislation. Section 35 Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) imposes a cap on damages and this section, the relevant gazetted figure and the provisions relevant to the claim for aggravated compensatory damages (s 35(2)) and mitigation (s 38(1)(a)) should be set out. References in the submissions under the heading ""Awards in other cases"" to comparable damages awards consist of jury verdicts and judgments handed down under the now repealed Defamation Act 1974 (NSW), where the legislation was entirely different. In addition, the comparable judgments referred to in the plaintiff's written submissions are all mass media defamation actions (some of them jury verdicts), and not private publications such as emails of the kind sent to a handful of people. In particular, the submissions do not refer to any matters in mitigation, such as the apology the defendant has attached to her defences. These submissions were not served on the defendant and it would be left to the trial judge to pick up these issues. Mr Weaver's statement that oral submissions could cure all these defects or omissions is unpersuasive.
33In determining what course to take, I have been guided by the principles set out in the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). I set out the relevant provisions and rules as well as the discussion and analysis of the principles involved in practice decisions in the New South Wales Supreme Court. 
The legislative framework
34Pt 29 r 29.7 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) (""UCPR"") provides that if an action is set down for hearing and one of the parties fails to appear, the court may proceed with the trial, so far as concerns any claim for relief in the proceedings, or adjourn the trial. If it is the defendant who fails to appear, then the plaintiff may prove its claim so far as the burden of proof lies upon it and, if a plaintiff can establish that he or she is entitled to the relief claimed, and such other relief as is consistent with what is sought, the court may proceed to make final orders (see Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (NSW) at [29.7.2], referring to Stone v Smith (1887) 35 Ch D 188 and Kingdon v Kirk (1887) 37 Ch D 141; see also Satz v ACN 069 808 957 Pty Ltd [2010] NSWSC 365 at [64]. In an adversarial system, the responsibility for conduct of a case rests with the party concerned and failure to appear in court is not a matter into which courts should inquire.
35However, for a party to be relevantly absent, they must have had ""adequate"" notice of the hearing date (Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (NSW) at [29.7.2], citing Magjarraj v Asteron Life Ltd [2009] NSWSC 1433 at [22]). 
36""Adequate"" notice was identified as being ""reasonable"" by Hallen J in French Consulting Pty Ltd v Lawson Stuart Donald [2011] NSWSC 584 at [14]:
""The clear purpose of UCPR rule 29.7 is the efficient dispatch of Court business. However, in despatching Court business, I cannot ignore the right of a defendant to be informed, or, at least, to be made aware, of a trial date. It is a fundamental principle that a party who may be adversely affected by the making of court orders has a right to be heard: Cameron v Cole [1944] HCA 5; (1944) 68 CLR 571, in which Rich J said (at 589):
It is a fundamental principle of natural justice, applicable to all courts whether superior or inferior, that a person against whom a claim or charge is made must be given a reasonable opportunity of appearing and presenting his case. If this principle be not observed, the person affected is entitled, ex debito justitiae, to have any determination which affects him set aside, and a court which finds that it has been led to purport to determine a matter in which there has been a failure to observe the principle has inherent jurisdiction to set its determination aside. ... In such a case that has been no valid trial at all.""
37Mr Weaver did not take me to any cases where one week's notice of a hearing was considered reasonable. I have been unable to find any appellate consideration of such a proposition. It is a practice that should be avoided.
38Section 66 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) provides that the court may adjourn a trial, a power generally exercised in accordance with the principles set out in ss 56 - 62. Examples include late service of documents on an unrepresented litigant (Scott v Handley [1999] FCA 404). Ritchie's Uniform Civil Procedure (NSW) notes at [s.66.5] that, ""where proceedings have been regularly fixed for hearing, with due notice to the affected parties"", applications for adjournments are unlikely to succeed.
39The question is what amounts to due notice. If Levy SC DCJ had made an order for service on the defendant and it had not been complied with, it is unlikely that this hearing could go ahead. If the defendant had had legal representatives who had not been notified, Mr Weaver agreed it would have been difficult for the case to proceed. The question is therefore whether Levy SC DCJ's asserted failure to order service of the orders was a considered decision (an unlikely result, as there were no reasons for judgment) or whether his Honour simply took for granted, as a busy judge with a heavy workload might easily do, that the orders would be served on the defendant in the usual way without the necessity for him to order the plaintiff to do so.
40Notification of procedural steps to an opponent is such a fundamental step in litigation that judges ought to be able to take this for granted. While it may have been preferable for a specific order to have been made, the plaintiff should not have needed an order from Levy SC DCJ to tell the defendant the date of hearing. Common sense, fairness and the provisions of ss 56 - 62 Civil Procedure Act 2005 should have been enough motivation for the plaintiff to take this essential step, and to do so well prior to 19 November 2013, especially if (as appears to be the case) his solicitor had some prior knowledge, however vague or scanty, that the defendant was, or could be, absent overseas. 
41Nor do I consider that litigants in person should be treated with less consideration than litigants who are legally represented. There have been many defamation actions where a defendant is self-represented; courts generally give a greater degree of leeway to such litigants: see Hallam v Ross [2011] QCA 274. As is noted in Tobin & Sexton, Australian Defamation Law and Practice at [60,590], defendants represent themselves in about 20% of all defamation actions resulting in a jury trial or hearing, and around 10% of all defamation trials are undefended. Litigants in person are common in defamation actions. Both the courts and their opponents need to have the flexibility to cope with this.
42Nor does the defendant's apparent concessions as to liability deny her the right to be heard on quantum. Issues of liability and quantum are perhaps more often dealt with separately in defamation than other causes of action, and concessions as to liability do not mean that the defendant will have nothing to say about quantum. The first two hearings under the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW) were for assessment of damages only and in both cases quantum was a hotly contested issue (Martin v Bruce (2007) 6 DCLR 15; Attrill v Christie [2007] NSWSC 1386). A party who may not oppose the striking out of a defence may still wish to be heard on damages in defamation, in much the same way that damages in relation to a motor vehicle accident or a claim for breach of contract may be divided. Nor is it uncommon for a party to file a defence on all issues to determine, at a later date, to contest quantum only.
43The circumstances in which a court would refuse the request of a party to conduct a hearing in the absence of the opponent would need to be compelling in the extreme. Having regard to the ""just, quick and cheap"" requirement in s 56, failure to advise of the hearing date until a week before the hearing is, however, one of the few grounds upon which a court would be reluctant to proceed. As Hallen J explained in French Consulting Pty Ltd v Lawson Stuart Donald, supra, at [14], failure to observe the right of a defendant to be informed means that there has been ""no valid trial at all"". However weak the defendant's arguments on quantum may be, or even if she does not wish to attend at all, she is entitled to be given adequate and reasonable notice of the hearing date. That has not occurred in these proceedings and I accordingly propose to vacate the hearing date and return these proceedings to the Defamation List for further management, including the allocation of a hearing date if considered appropriate by the judges conducting that list.
44The orders I have made provide for the court to make a copy of this judgment and today's orders available to the defendant, and my associate will accordingly forward (by both post and email) copies of these documents to her, as well as to the plaintiff, as soon as practicable, and no later than 29 November 2013.
Orders
(1)The defendant, Jane Wolfe, called outside Court 13D three times at 10:28am - no appearance.
(2)By reason of the fact that the defendant was not notified of the 28 November 2013 hearing date until 19 November 2013 (albeit in circumstances where no notification order was made on 23 August 2013), and has advised that she is overseas until 30 December 2013, today's hearing date is vacated (Gibson DCJ to give reasons).
(3)These proceedings are to be returned to the Defamation List on Friday 6 December 2013 so that the defendant may be notified by email by the court of these orders and provided with a copy of Gibson DCJ's judgment, and a fresh hearing date obtained.
(4)Note Gibson DCJ is not part heard.
(5)Costs of today reserved.

		29 November 2013",2013-11-27 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705813,R v Little [2013] NSWCCA 288,"Judgment

1BLANCH J: The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against a sentence imposed on Daniel James Little, the respondent, in the District Court at Wagga Wagga on 19 April 2013 on the ground that the sentence imposed was manifestly inadequate.

2On 30 November 2012 the respondent entered pleas of guilty to the following counts:

(1)Specially aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence (wound Elizabeth Cattell) on or about 22 January 2009 contrary to s 112(3) Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 

(2)Aggravated robbery with wounding on or about 22 January 2009 contrary to s 96 Crimes Act 1900 which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment.

3On 19 April 2013 he was sentenced on count 1 to imprisonment for 6 years commencing 8 July 2010 and expiring 7 July 2016. A non-parole period was fixed of 3 years and 6 months expiring on 7 January 2014. On count 2 he was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment commencing 8 October 2010 and expiring 7 October 2016 and a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months expiring on 7 April 2014. In imposing sentence Judge English indicated her remarks when previously sentencing the respondent should also be taken into account. That comment relates to a sentence imposed by the same judge on the respondent on 4 August 2010. On that day he was sentenced to a total term of 3 years and 9 months commencing 8 July 2009 and expiring 7 April 2013. A non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months was specified and that expired on 7 October 2011.

History of proceedings
4On 8 July 2009 the respondent was arrested for the offence committed in 2008 and he has been in custody since that date. On 2 December 2009 he was charged with the subject 2009 offence. On 5 February 2010 the 2009 offences were dismissed at committal in the Local Court. On 15 March 2010 the Crown filed a notice of intention to file an ex officio indictment in relation to these offences.

5On 4 August 2010 the judge sentenced the respondent for the 2008 offences. On the same day the judge found under Part 2 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 he was not fit to be tried in relation to the 2009 offences. The reason for accepting the plea of guilty and proceeding to sentence and at the same time finding the respondent unfit to be tried was explained by the judge by reference to the psychiatric material. In a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist of 6 July 2010 he said:

""My concerns lie in his capacity to follow proceedings and also his capacity to instruct counsel during proceedings as there is a risk that he would misunderstand information that is provided during the court given his problems found on neurological testing; on balance I believe there are grounds to consider that he is marginally unfit to stand trial.

If he was pleading guilty to the offence then this might be less of an issue; then I believe he is likely fit to plead but if there was a trial then this would be an issue of concern.""

6On 29 November 2010 the Mental Health Review Tribunal concluded that the respondent remained unfit to be tried and would not be fit in the ensuing 12 months.

7On 23 August 2011 the matter came before Judge Norrish QC in the District Court and he refused the application that the respondent be permitted to plead guilty.

8On 7 October 2011 the non-parole period for the sentence imposed on the 2008 offence expired but the respondent remained in custody because he was a forensic patient under the Mental Health Review Tribunal. In February 2012 the Mental Health Review Tribunal again reviewed the respondent but found he was still unfit to stand trial.

9On 30 November 2012 Judge English found the respondent fit to plead guilty and be sentenced although she was of the view that he remained unfit to stand trial. On 19 April 2013 she found as a result of reports from Dr Scott Clark and Dr Jones and Dr Allnutt that the respondent was fit to plead.

Facts
10At about 10pm on 22 January 2009 the respondent entered the home of Elizabeth Jean Cattell who was aged 82 and her daughter Maria Elizabeth Cattell aged 46 in Bourke Street, Turvey Park. He entered through a rear door and confronted Maria Cattell. He was wearing a hood and armed with an implement made by attaching a cricket ball to a pool cue handle. He covered his face and waved the implement around telling Maria Cattell ""Give me money, give me money now"" and he struck her with the implement on her right shoulder. Maria Cattell tried to stand between the respondent and her mother but her mother reached around and grabbed the respondent's arm. Maria retreated to obtain money from her wallet and returned with $30. The respondent said ""I want more"" and struck Maria Cattell once with the implement. She then went to obtain more money and he struck Elizabeth Cattell to the head with the mallet. 

11Maria then gave him a further $50. He then struck her again with the implement and ran out of the house. The implement was subsequently found abandoned in the house. 

12As a result of the assaults Maria Cattell sustained a 4cm long deep laceration to the left side of the skull which required 5 sutures and a second deep long laceration to her scalp over 4cm which required the insertion of 13 staples to repair the wound. She also had bruising to her right shoulder. 

13Elizabeth Cattell sustained a 6cm jagged laceration to the left front temple which required 27 staples to repair the wound and a 3cm laceration to the left scalp which required 7 staples to repair the wound and she suffered a bruise to the left forearm.

14In an intercepted telephone call after the event the respondent was recorded as saying:

""They went like that and I went like that, there, and I went whoosh. That was to stop them trying to pull my hand from my mouth so that they couldn't see my mouth and I just whacked the cunt, hacked them hard, hard, and went whack there and whack there and whoosh.""

15In relation to the earlier offence of 26 October 2008 the respondent and another offender went into the presbytery of the Catholic Church at Turvey Park. The respondent was armed with a knife and wearing a balaclava and he threatened the Parish Priest with the knife and demanded money from the presbytery safe. He pushed the handle of the knife into the priest's back and when the priest opened the safe he removed a number of money bags containing cash, cheques and credit card details from parishioners collected over the weekend services. The offenders escaped with $2435.

The Crown submissions
16At the sentencing proceedings on 19 April 2013 the Crown sought an accumulation of sentences commencing at the expiration of the non-parole period fixed for the 2008 offence. That non-parole period expired on 7 October 2011. The judge, however, commenced the sentences for these offences from 8 July 2010.

17In this Court the Crown argues there was a ""failure to adequately accumulate the sentences"" and that the statutory ratio was varied to an extent which resulted in a manifestly inadequate non-parole period. In putting that proposition the Crown concedes ""the measure of accumulation of 12 months on the 2010 robbery was lenient but probably not erroneously so ..."" I assume that relates to the robbery which occurred in 2008 for which sentence was imposed in 2010. The earlier non-parole period expired on 7 October 2011. The non-parole period for these offences expires on 7 April 2014 which adds 2 years and 6 months to the period the respondent will be in custody. 

18In sentencing for the 2008 offence the sentencing judge categorised the offence as one falling above that envisaged in the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 where the Court of Criminal Appeal indicated that a sentence of between 4 and 5 years was called for. When she imposed the sentence she imposed a sentence of 3 years and 9 months. There was no Crown appeal in respect of that sentence. The argument sought to be advanced here is that the sentences under appeal are manifestly inadequate in that there should have been a greater accumulation on the pre-existing sentence and there should be a greater accumulation in respect of the second sentence under appeal. I note, however, that before the sentencing judge the submission of the Crown was that ""There would be separate and distinct sentences imposed although those sentences would have a significant degree of concurrency"". The Crown also conceded that had the matter been dealt with at the same time as the 2008 offence ""there may have been some limited accumulation of the sentences imposed.""

19In Regina v Weldon; Regina v Carberry (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 Ipp JA at [48] stated that it is:

""not infrequent that, where the offences arise out of one criminal enterprise, concurrent sentences will be imposed"" ... ""this is not an inflexible rule"".

20In determining whether there is to be accumulation and the extent of that accumulation it is firstly necessary to identify the separate acts and any harm flowing from those acts. It is then appropriate to impose separate and cumulative sentences where the requirements of justice so dictate. In doing that, however, it is necessary to take account of the principle of totality and in arriving at a final sentence all the factors relating to the objective criminality and all the factors relating to the subjective circumstances of the offender must be taken into account.

Consideration
21The respondent was born on 29 May 1986. At the time he committed these offences he was 22 years of age and he was 23 years of age when he commenced serving the sentence imposed for the 2008 offence. He has a juvenile record which included aggravated robbery in 2003, common assault in 2004, break and enter with intent, using an offensive weapon, common assault and larceny in 2005 and stealing from the person in 2006, traffic offences in 2008 and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2008. None of the above offences resulted in incarceration but he was placed on a 3 year s 9 bond in May 2008. He was on that bond at the time he committed the offences. He was given a 30 hours community service order in September 2008 for break and enter with intent. Accordingly, this is the first time he has served a gaol sentence.

22The sentencing judge referred to Dr Rowe's report and said that he 

""... determined that the offender had been affected with a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder from infancy associated with mild to moderate retardation and an ADD. He found the offender to be suffering from impaired language skills, verbal intellectual difficulties and an IQ which was initially assessed between 50 per cent and 55 per cent, and later between 68 per cent and 79 per cent. He was of the opinion that the offender's neurological disorder caused him to suffer significant impairment of rational understanding, comprehension, consequential thinking and judgment.""

23It is clear from the reports that the respondent has significant mental health issues and I have already outlined the history relating to the question of his fitness to plead. The sentencing judge correctly regarded this material as indicating that general deterrence was a matter of less significance in this case than it might otherwise have been.

24The history of the proceedings against the respondent indicate that his period so far in custody would have been very disrupted as his mental state was assessed at various stages of the proceedings. In addition he has significant hearing problems. Moreover, through no fault of his own there has been considerable delay in getting the matter to finality in the Court. The Crown appeal was lodged promptly on 7 May 2013 but in addition to the delay the respondent has suffered in the past he now suffers the additional delay of more than 6 months from the lodging of the appeal. The effect of all the delay in this case is that the matter now comes for determination less than 5 months from a time when he is to be released from custody after serving 4 years and 9 months in custody.

25In Green v The Queen and Quinn v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 462 at page 479 [43] in the majority judgment of Finch CJ it was said:

""Other circumstances may combine to produce injustice if a Crown appeal is allowed. They include delay in the hearing and determination of the appeal, the imminent or past occurrence of the respondent's release on parole or unconditionally, and the effect of re-sentencing on progress towards the respondent's rehabilitation.""

26In Green v The Queen supra page 465 [1] the principle long established by the High Court was reaffirmed that the purpose of Crown appeals is:

""to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.""

27The Court went on to say at page 477 [36]:

""It does not extend to the general correction of errors made by sentencing judges. It provides a general framework within which to assess the significance of factors relevant to the exercise of the discretion.""

28The High Court also said in Johnson v The Queen (2004) 205 ALR 346:

"" Judges at first instance should be afforded as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime under which the sentencing is effected.""

29In this case the Crown did not appeal against the sentence for the first offence which was passed in 2010. The Crown accepted in the sentencing proceedings for these two offences that there would be substantial concurrence between the two sentences. The Crown appeal focuses on the extent of the accumulation for these offences on the 2008 offence both as to the head sentence and non-parole period. In my view, the sentencing judge carefully considered all of the subjective and objective features of the case and cannot be said to be in error in her considerations. It is not for this Court to impose another sentence simply because it believes a longer sentence should be imposed. The sentences imposed by the sentencing judge here were within the broad sentencing discretion of a sentencing judge and the challenge to them has not been made out.

30Similarly the challenge to the non-parole period does not succeed. The non-parole period fixed represents a ratio of approximately two thirds rather than the statutory ratio of 75 per cent. Bearing in mind the respondent's age, the fact he was in gaol for the first time and his mental and physical health problems that cannot be said to be an error. In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA at [31] it was pointed out that the adjustment of a non-parole period to reflect special circumstances raises many discretionary matters and an appellate court will be slow to intervene.

31Even if the challenges to the sentences and non-parole periods could be established it would be appropriate to exercise the discretion of this Court to dismiss the appeal because of the delay, the pending release of the respondent, the position taken by the Crown at first instance and the medical condition of the respondent.

32I would dismiss the appeal.

		25 November 2013",2013-11-17 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705820,PPC v Williams [2013] NSWCCA 286,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  The applicant is the complainant in respect of a charge of aggravated sexual assault brought by the Director of Public Prosecutions, against the respondent.  Following an incident at the trial of the respondent, in which the cross-examination of the applicant was adjourned, the prosecution made a disclosure to the defence.  There were indications and information that the applicant was on medication.  Ultimately, that led to the discharge of the jury and a new trial has been set down.  
2The respondent sought and obtained leave to issue subpoenas relating to the complainant's medical and psychiatric condition, under s 298(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (the Act).  Following the production of the subpoenaed material to the Court, the respondent sought leave to allow production of such material to the respondent and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The trial judge granted access to the subpoenaed material under s 298(2) of the Act, subject to the exclusion of some documents.  The access was limited to the legal representatives of the parties.
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal, pursuant to s 5F(3AB) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, against the decision of the trial judge to allow production of part of the subpoenaed material to the parties' legal representatives. 
4The applicant's name has been anonymised having regard to s 578A of the Crimes Act 1900, which prohibits the publication of any matter that would identify the complainant in prescribed sexual offence proceedings, the definition of which includes an offence under s 61J and s 66C of the Crimes Act: see the definition of ""prescribed sexual offence"" in s 3(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.
5Section 15A of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 similarly prohibits publication of the applicant's name, as she was a child aged 14 when the alleged offences are said to have taken place.
6For the reasons given below, leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be allowed and the orders of the trial judge should be set aside (except insofar as those orders allow access to those parts of the subpoenaed material in respect of which no objection was taken by the applicant).  The application for leave to allow production of the balance of the subpoenaed material should be referred back to the trial judge for reconsideration in the light of this Court's ruling.
Procedural Background
7The trial before a jury began on 21 January 2013 before his Honour Judge McClintock.  The respondent was indicted on a charge that in December 2010 he did have sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, in circumstances of aggravation, the complainant being 14 years old, contrary to s 61J(d) of the Crimes Act.  There was an alternative charge of sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years, contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act. 
8On the third day of the trial the cross-examination of the applicant was adjourned over concerns about her welfare, with the trial judge noting that ""she did not appear to be responding at all"" (Tcpt 23/1/13 p 103).  The trial continued and the applicant's cross-examination was completed the following day.  On 29 January 2013, the Crown advised the Court that the applicant had taken antipsychotic medication after she had experienced difficulties responding in cross-examination (Tcpt 29/1/13 p 166.5-16).  Information also emerged about the applicant's medical and psychiatric history that pre-dated the alleged offence.  The jury were discharged the next day. 
9Proceedings were then commenced by the respondent under Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Act in regard to documents which are the subject of sexual assault communications privilege.  Section 299A of the Act provides that the applicant has standing in proceedings which seek the production of documents that may disclose a ""protected confidence"", as defined by s 296 of the Act: see [21]-[22] below.  Accordingly, the applicant was represented throughout these proceedings.
10On 24 May 2013, the respondent sought leave under s 298(1) of the Act to issue a number of subpoenas.  Leave was required because the material produced was likely to include a ""protected confidence"" as defined by s 296 of the Act.  The subpoenas were to be issued to the Lawson Clinical Depression and Bipolar Disorder Specialists, Linfield Medical Practice, Headspace Central Sydney, Child Adolescent Mental Health Service at Hornsby Hospital and Dr Kam Wong at the Sydney Metta Clinic.  The subpoenas requested copies of:
(1)records of any diagnosis made in relation to the patient;
(2)records of test results;
(3)records of prescription medications issued to the patient, and
(4)records of patient compliance on prescription medications.
11The trial judge delivered judgment on 24 May 2013, granting leave for issue of the subpoenas.  It appears that material was produced in response to each of the subpoenas, except by the Lawson Clinic.  
12On 29 July 2013, the trial judge heard an application by the respondent for leave to allow production of the documents under s 298(2) of the Act, that is, to allow the parties access to the subpoenaed material.  This was opposed by the applicant.  For the purposes of dealing with this application for production, the applicant's solicitor was provided with access to the documents, presumably under s 299B(4): see NAR v PPC1 [2013] NSWCCA 25 at [31].
13The applicant provided the trial judge with a confidential submission setting out the grounds of objection to the grant of leave to produce the documents under s 298(2).  For the assistance of the trial judge, the applicant's solicitor tagged the documents produced on subpoena with the following colour code:
(1)pink flag: indicated objection was taken on the ground that the document disclosed prior sexual history and was inadmissible under s 293 of the Act;
(2)yellow flag: indicated objection was taken on the ground of sexual assault communications privilege.  Objection was also taken on the ground of relevance;
(3)green flag: indicated no objection was taken to production.
14The trial judge adjourned the proceedings to 1 August 2013 to consider these submissions.  On that date, his Honour gave an ex tempore judgment granting access to the legal representatives of the parties only, subject to the exclusion of ""substantially irrelevant"" material.  He stayed his decision to allow the solicitor for the applicant a further opportunity to inspect the documents and make submissions on allowing access to the parties' legal representatives.
15Further confidential submissions were filed by the applicant on 2 August 2013, together with a confidential affidavit by the applicant specifying the harm she was likely to suffer, if access were allowed to the material.  The applicant's solicitor also tagged a number of documents with a blue flag.  This was to indicate that objection was taken to the production of such documents on the grounds of irrelevance and no substantial probative value, as they were rendered inadmissible under s 293 of the Act because they related to prior sexual history.
16The trial judge delivered an ex tempore judgment on 2 August 2013 granting the parties' legal representatives only access to the subpoenaed material which had been marked with a blue flag, except for a limited number of such documents.
Sexual assault communications privilege
17The scheme of the sexual assault communications privilege established by Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Act, including the prohibitions with respect to producing documents or adducing into evidence in a criminal proceeding a document recording or revealing a ""protected confidence"", except with the grant of leave, has been recently considered by this Court in KS v Veitch (No 2) [2012] NSWCCA 266 and NAR v PPC1.
18Neither party takes issue with the Court's construction of the relevant provisions of Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Act, in particular, s 298, s 299B and s 299D of the Act, in KS v Veitch (No 2) and NAR v PPC1. 
19Further, there is no issue on the present application that the documents produced in response to subpoenas by a number of medical and psychiatric practitioners that have treated the applicant, included ""protected confidences"" as defined by s 296 of the Act.  Nor is there any dispute that the applicant was a ""protected confider"", as defined by s 295 of the Act.  
20It is sufficient for the present case, to note the following features of the privilege established by Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 of the Act.
Scope of the privilege
21First, the scope of the privilege established by the Act applies to a ""protected confidence"".  This is defined by s 296(1) as meaning a ""counselling communication that is made, by, to or about a victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence"".
22The term ""counselling communication"" is defined in s 296(2) to s 296(5).  It is sufficient for present purposes to note the terms of s 296(2) and s 296(4) which provide:
""296  What is a protected confidence?
...
(2)  A counselling communication is a protected confidence for the purposes of this Division even if it:
(a)  was made before the acts constituting the relevant sexual assault offence occurred or are alleged to have occurred, or
(b)  was not made in connection with a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence or any condition arising from a sexual assault offence or alleged sexual assault offence.
...
(4)  In this section:
counselling communication means a communication:
(a)  made in confidence by a person (the counselled person) to another person (the counsellor) who is counselling the person in relation to any harm the person may have suffered, or
(b)  made in confidence to or about the counselled person by the counsellor in the course of that counselling, or
(c)   made in confidence about the counselled person by a counsellor or a parent, carer or other supportive person who is present to facilitate communication between the counselled person and the counsellor or to otherwise further the counselling process, or
(d)  made in confidence by or to the counsellor, by or to another counsellor or by or to a person who is counselling, or has at any time counselled, the person.
... .""
The prohibition
23Secondly, at the core of the present application is the prohibition in s 298 which provides:
""298  Protected confidences-criminal proceedings
(1)  Except with the leave of the court, a person cannot seek to compel (whether by subpoena or any other procedure) any other person to produce a document recording a protected confidence in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.
(2)  Except with the leave of the court, a document recording a protected confidence cannot be produced in, or in connection with, any criminal proceedings.
(3)  Except with the leave of the court, evidence cannot be adduced in any criminal proceedings if it would disclose a protected confidence or the contents of a document recording a protected confidence.""
24It has been observed that s 298 provides a tripartite structure which operates to prohibit the issue of a subpoena; the production of a document to the Court in answer to a subpoena; and the adducing of evidence recording or revealing a protected confidence, except with the grant of leave: KS v Veitch (No 2) at [23] per Basten JA.
The s 299D requirements
25Thirdly, the power of the Court to grant leave to take any of the steps contemplated by s 298, including allowing access to subpoenaed documents under s 298(2), is circumscribed by the operation of s 299D, which provides:
""299D   Determining whether to grant leave
(1)  The court cannot grant an application for leave under this Division unless the court is satisfied that:
(a)  the document or evidence will, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or adduced or to be produced or adduced by the party seeking to produce or adduce the document or evidence, have substantial probative value, and
(b)  other documents or evidence concerning the matters to which the protected confidence relates are not available, and
(c)  the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm is substantially outweighed by the public interest in admitting into evidence information or the contents of a document of substantial probative value.
(2)  Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account for the purposes of determining the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of protected confidences and protecting the principal protected confider from harm, the court must take into account the following:
(a)  the need to encourage victims of sexual offences to seek counselling,
(b)  that the effectiveness of counselling is likely to be dependent on the maintenance of the confidentiality of the counselling relationship,
(c)  the public interest in ensuring that victims of sexual offences receive effective counselling,
(d)  that the disclosure of the protected confidence is likely to damage or undermine the relationship between the counsellor and the counselled person,
(e)  whether disclosure of the protected confidence is sought on the basis of a discriminatory belief or bias,
(f)  that the adducing of the evidence is likely to infringe a reasonable expectation of privacy.
(3)  For the purposes of determining an application for leave under this Division, the court may permit a confidential statement to be made to it by or on behalf of the principal protected confider by affidavit specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer if the application for leave is granted.
(4)  A court must not disclose or make available to a party (other than the principal protected confider) any confidential statement made to the court under this section by or on behalf of the principal protected confider.
(5)  The court must state its reasons for granting or refusing to grant an application for leave under this Division.
(6)  If there is a jury, the court is to hear and determine any application for leave under this Division in the absence of the jury.""
26Fourthly, the test to be applied under s 299D in the regulation of the production of documents and the adducing of evidence is the same.  In both cases, for the purpose of assessing the balance between the two competing public interests as required by s 299D(1)(c), it is to be assumed that the information contained in the documents will in fact be admitted into evidence in one form or another: KS v Veitch (No 2) at [35].  How that assumption is to operate at the production of documents stage may present a difficult task for the Court, particularly in light of the inadmissibility of material referring to prior sexual history under s 293 of the Act, unless it falls within one of the exceptions provided under s 293(4) or 293(6).
Procedural matters
27Fifthly, certain procedural aspects of an application for leave under s 298 are dealt with in s 299B, which provides:
""Determining if there is a protected confidence
(1)  If a question arises under this Division relating to a document or evidence, a court may consider the document or evidence.
(2)  If there is a jury, the document or evidence is to be considered in the absence of the jury.
(3)  A court must not make available or disclose to a party (other than a protected confider) any document or evidence to which this section applies (or the contents of any such document) unless:
(a)  the court determines that the document does not record a protected confidence or that the evidence would not disclose a protected confidence, or
(b)  a party has been given leave under this Division in relation to the document or evidence and making available or disclosing the document or evidence is consistent with that leave.
(4)  A court may make any orders it thinks fit to facilitate its consideration of a document or evidence under this section.
(5)  This section has effect despite sections 297 and 298.""
28Section 299B enables the Court to have access to the relevant document before deciding whether it should be made available to a party and that it should have the relevant powers to ""facilitate its consideration"" of the document: s 299B(4).  Those powers extend to permitting a ""protected confider"" to have access to a document without the necessity of considering whether the criteria for the grant of leave in s 299D have been satisfied: NAR v PPC1 at [31].  This occurred in the present case, and facilitated the provision of the applicant's confidential submissions and the tagging of the subpoenaed material by the applicant's solicitor, as referred to at [13] and [15] above.
29Further, s 299B(3)(b) confirms that the preconditions for the grant of leave specified in s 299D must be satisfied before access to subpoenaed documents recording a protected confidence can be granted to a party, ""other than a protected confider"": NAR v PPC1 at [31].  ""Protected confider"" relevantly includes the ""victim or alleged victim of a sexual assault offence by, to or about whom a protected confidence is made"": s 295.
30Section 299B(3)(b) has significance in the present case because one of the arguments advanced by the respondent in support of the orders made by the trial judge would, if accepted, be contrary to the emphatic language of that provision: see [93] below.
Inadmissible evidence
31Sixthly, subject to certain exceptions in s 293(4) and s 293(6), evidence concerning a complainant's sexual experience, or lack of it, are rendered inadmissible by s 293(3), which provides:
""293   Admissibility of evidence relating to sexual experience
...
(3)  Evidence that discloses or implies:
(a)  that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or
(b)  has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity,
      is inadmissible.""
32It is unnecessary to set out the detail of the exceptions to the inadmissibility of evidence of prior sexual history under s 293(4) and s 293(6).
Substantial probative value
33Seventhly, the concept of ""substantial probative value"", accepting that it extends to questions or evidence relevant to the credibility of the complainant, must nevertheless be concerned with admissible material: KS v Veitch (No 2) at [37]; NAR v PPC1 at [29].  Thus, the restrictions on the admissibility of material concerning a complainant's sexual experience or lack of it, as found in s 293, also engage the requirements in s 299D(1): KS v Veitch (No 2) at [37]; NAR v PPC1 at [29].
Ancillary orders
34Eighthly, reference also needs to be made to s 302 of the Act, which deals with ancillary orders and provides:
""Ancillary orders
(1)  Without limiting any action the court may take to limit the possible harm, or extent of the harm, likely to be caused by the disclosure of evidence of, or the contents of a document recording, a protected confidence, the court may:
(a)  order that all or part of the evidence be heard or document produced in camera, and
(b)  make such orders relating to the production and inspection of the document as, in the opinion of the court, are necessary to protect the safety and welfare of any protected confider.""
35In the present case, the trial judge's order limiting access to the parties' legal representatives only was made pursuant to s 302.  
The judge's reasons
Judgment of 1 August 2013
36In his first judgment of 1 August 2013, the trial judge recorded (at p 2) that the subpoenaed material may be broadly described as a series of files relating to the medical and psychiatric treatment and attendant counselling of the applicant in the period before and after the alleged commission of the offence by the respondent.  His Honour noted that the material contained a series of events as disclosed by the applicant together with a series of documents provided by the applicant; a series of diagnoses; the listing of symptoms, most of which came from either histories given by the applicant or material supplied by third parties, including relatives.
37The trial judge also recorded (at p 2) that the issues in the trial concern the applicant's account, which so far as it concerned lack of consent, was not corroborated or confirmed by any independent evidence.  His Honour noted that the defence outlined by counsel for the respondent indicated that sexual intercourse did not take place.
38The issues raised by the defence as noted by the trial judge (at p 3), related to the reliability and truthfulness of the applicant's account, her veracity in terms of incidents not directly related to the incident in issue in the trial and general issues in respect of her overall credit.  The trial judge observed (at p 3) that material in the subpoenaed documents contained within it a series of diagnoses which ""give rise to concerns about the stability and reliability of the applicant and also concerns about whether the applicant is capable, or indeed does confabulate, described in much more extreme terms such as hallucinations"".  The trial judge found (at p 3) that:
""The totality of the material fulfils the test of substantial probative value.""
39His Honour reasoned (at p 4) that ""the material has to be read in totality to make it comprehensible"".  He went on to find (at p 4) that subject to the excision of material that might be regarded as ""substantially irrelevant or irrelevant"" to the issue of substantial probative value, the material had substantive probative value both as to facts in issue, the issue of consent, the reliability of the complainant's evidence and issues of credit.
40His Honour's approach to the assessment of ""substantial probative value"" is the subject of Ground 1 of the proposed appeal.
41The trial judge stated (at p 5) in relation to the paragraph (c) requirement in s 299D(1):
""In other words, a decision has to have already been made under (a) as to the existence of probative value and then the issue is the admission into evidence of the information.  That provision seems to have application only to the third part of the process, that is adducing of the evidence"".  (emphasis added).
42His Honour's reference to the ""third part of the process"" is to be understood as a reference to the prohibition in s 298(3), that evidence cannot be adduced in any criminal proceedings, if it would disclose a ""protected confidence"" or the contents of a document recording a ""protected confidence"", except with the leave of the Court.
43His Honour went on to observe (at p 5) that:
""Notwithstanding that finding, it is a relevant matter to take into account the totality of s 299D(2) ..."",  
and then set out the terms of that provision without elaborating any further.
44His Honour noted (at p 5) that s 299D(3) provided that the Court may permit a confidential statement to be made to it by or on behalf of the principal protected confider by affidavit specifying the harm the confider is likely to suffer.  His Honour also noted that he had received such a document on the application and stated that he had taken that document into account.  
45Ground 2(a) of the proposed appeal contends that the trial judge erred in finding that s 299D(1)(c) was only applicable at the time of determining whether evidence could be adduced under s 298(3).  Grounds 2(b) and (c) contend that the trial judge also erred in failing to properly take into account the s 299D(2) factors and the confidential affidavit of the applicant provided under s 299D(3).  
46The trial judge correctly observed (at p 6) that material referring to a prior sexual history is inadmissible under s 293 of the Act, unless it fell within one of the exceptions provided under s 293(4) and s 293(6).  However, the trial judge deferred consideration of this issue to the stage of adducing of evidence at the trial.  His Honour considered (at p 6) that there was no bar, apart from the Division 2 process, for the production of the subpoenaed material and stated that ""other criteria"" were to be applied in respect of the adducing of such evidence.  The reference by his Honour to ""other criteria"" appears to be a reference to the exceptions to inadmissibility of documents concerning prior sexual history, under s 293(4) and s 293(6).
47It is with respect to the deferral of the consideration of the s 293 issue that Grounds 3(a), (b) and (c) of the proposed appeal are directed.
48Having decided to allow access to the subpoenaed materials, his Honour noted (at p 6) that the order he proposed to make under s 302 of the Act would limit such access to the parties' legal representatives only.  
Judgment of 2 August 2013
49In his second judgment, the trial judge ruled on the applicant's objection to access being granted to certain documents which had been marked by the applicant's solicitor with a blue tag, as referred to at [15] above.
50His Honour upheld some of the objections and declined to allow access to a small number of documents.  Consistently with his previous ruling on 1 August 2013, his Honour allowed access to the balance of the documents in respect of which the applicant objected to access being granted on the grounds inadmissibility under of s 293, notwithstanding that he acknowledged that at least some of the documents gave rise to such an issue.  This acknowledgement specifically related to documents produced by the Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service concerning various alleged sexual assaults unrelated to the charges against the respondent (at p 1); and documents produced by the Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service containing material referable to the applicant's conduct prior to the alleged sexual assault by the respondent (at p 6).
Leave to appeal
51It is to be accepted that one of the principal reasons for subjecting appeals from interlocutory orders in criminal cases to a requirement to obtain leave is to prevent or minimise the fragmentation of the process of criminal justice: R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215; 71 NSWLR 31 at [23].
52Generally, leave to appeal an interlocutory decision of the present type should not readily be granted, unless an appropriate case is made out of an error of principle, which is apt to cause an irregularity or an injustice: Queanbeyan City Council v Environment Protection Authority [2011] NSWCCA 108 at [25] per Whealey JA (Hall and McCallum JJ agreeing).  
53In my view, this application raises an important question as to the proper construction of the requirements of s 299D(1) at the stage when leave is sought under s 298(2) to obtain access to a document in criminal proceedings to which sexual assault communications privilege attaches.  There is also an important question as to the interaction between the requirements of s 299D(1) and the inadmissibility of evidence relating to prior sexual history (subject to limited exceptions) under s 293 of the Act.  Leave to appeal should be granted.
Grounds of appeal
Ground 1 - Error in the assessment of substantial probative value
54Ground 1 contends that his Honour erred in his approach to the assessment of the substantial probative value of the subpoenaed material.
55This contention is primarily directed to the following passage of his Honour's preliminary judgment of 1 August 2013 (at p 4):
""At this stage I am required under 299D to make a decision in respect of 299D(1) which is 'whether the evidence or document, either by itself or having regard to other documents or evidence produced or to be adduced by the party seeking produce or adduce the documents, have substantial value'.  For the reasons I have outlined the material has to be read in its totality to make it comprehensible.  Subject to the excision of material that might be substantially irrelevant or irrelevant to the issue of substantial probative value which I allow by staying the execution of this judgment for a period - I find that it does have substantial probative value both as to the facts in issue, the issues in the trial particularly the issue of consent, the reliability of the complainant's evidence and issues of credit.""
56This passage of the judgment is to be read together with the later statement of his Honour (at pp 6-7):
""However there may be material that a final claim may be made by the confider's representative and I am prepared to stay the order for a day so that a final review of the material, which, as I say, is voluminous, can be undertaken and any final claim for exclusion on the basis that it does not fit my ruling can be made.""
57The applicant submitted that the trial judge erred in finding that ""the totality of the material fulfils the test of substantial probative value"".  This finding was said to be erroneously premised on his Honour's view that all of the ""material has to be read in its totality to make it comprehensible"".  It was submitted that the inclusive approach adopted by the trial judge, placed undue weight on admitting all documents so as to create a complete picture, rather than focusing on particular documents that satisfy the requirement of substantial probative value.
58The applicant submitted that much of the subpoenaed material is too remote in time, too remote in content or otherwise ultimately inadmissible.  For these reasons, it was contended that it was not necessary to produce the applicant's entire medical and psychiatric history in order to comprehend a recent diagnosis, nor was it necessary to produce years of counselling notes in order to assess issues of the applicant's reliability and credit.  
59The applicant further submitted that the approach adopted by the trial judge effectively reversed the purpose of the statutory regime by considering all documents to have substantial probative value, subject to the applicant identifying documents that might be ""substantially irrelevant or irrelevant"".
60In this regard, the applicant had accepted before the trial judge, that some of the subpoenaed material was relevant to the diagnosis of the applicant and relevant to her overall credit, and accordingly it was open to his Honour to find that some documents had substantial probative value.  However, the applicant did not accept that all the material produced was capable of being so characterised.  
61The applicant pointed, by way of example, to medical documents produced by the Lindfield Medical Centre which contained general practitioner's records apparently from 1999, when the applicant was 3 years old, through until the present day.  In respect of these documents, the applicant had provided written consent under s 300 of the Act to the production of two documents dated 5 December 2010 and 15 December 2010.  The applicant's complaint was that her medical history before that date had little, or no probative value, and did not satisfy the paragraph (a) requirement of s 299D(1).  
62In relation to material produced by Dr Kam Wong, the applicant submitted that a significant amount of material covered the period of the applicant's junior schooling and was largely irrelevant.  
63In relation to material produced by the Northern Sydney Central Coast Area Health Service, the applicant submitted that this related to multiple admissions of the applicant for treatment.  The applicant accepted that some material, particularly that related to recent admissions, mental health diagnosis and the use of medication, might have substantial probative value.  However, it was contended that the balance of the material disclosing past sexual experience, suicide attempts and counselling notes from earlier admissions had little or no probative value, and did not satisfy the paragraph (a) requirement of s 299D(1).
Consideration
64This Court is limited on this appeal to the description of the subpoenaed documents given in the applicant's confidential submissions provided to the trial judge, as broadly summarised by his Honour (at p 2) in his judgment of 1 August 2013.  The Court has not been provided with the subpoenaed documents for inspection.  Those documents were however inspected by the trial judge.  Having regard his Honour's description of the material, there is no reason to doubt the applicant's description of the documents in her confidential submissions to the trial judge.
65In my view, his Honour was in error in adopting an inclusive approach to the assessment of substantial probative value.  The error in his Honour's approach is apparent from two matters. 
66First, the characterisation of the ""totality"" of the material as fulfilling the test of ""substantial probative value"" failed to take into account the apparent lack of relevance of those documents identified, by way of example, in the applicant's submissions referred to above, as being too remote in terms of either time or context.  
67Furthermore, the approach of allowing access to documents in their ""totality"" to make some of the material comprehensible, is inconsistent with the focus required by the more restrictive approach in s 299D(1)(a).  This requires satisfaction of the ""substantial probative value"" test in respect of each document in respect of which access is allowed to the parties, rather than the broader ""legitimate forensic purpose"" test generally applied to production of documents under subpoena: KS v Veitch (No 2) at [32].
68Secondly, the assessment of ""substantial probative value"" was undertaken by his Honour without regard to whether the documents may not be admissible in evidence by virtue of s 293 of the Act.  Although this matter is the subject of specific complaint under Grounds 3(a), (b) and (c), it is also of significance under Ground 1.  This is because the assessment of ""substantial probative value"" under s 299D(1)(a) must be concerned with material that is ultimately admissible: KS v Veitch (No 2) at 266 [37]; NAR v PPC1 at [29].
69It may be accepted that, in assessing whether the subpoenaed material had substantial probative value, the trial judge was confronted with a difficult task.  His Honour was required to assess an apparently large number of documents including medical records and other materials relating to the applicant, covering a broad period and dealing with a number of discrete incidents and a range of medical and psychiatric issues.  A number of the incidents were unrelated to the incident giving rise to the charges against the respondent.  It is understandable that some of the material may not have been readily comprehensible.  Nonetheless, such difficulties do not warrant an inclusive approach to be taken to the assessment of substantial probative value.  It was necessary for his Honour to be satisfied that each document, or category of documents where documents related to the same incident or issue concerning the applicant, satisfied the paragraph (a) requirement in s 299D(1) of the Act.
70Ground 1 should be upheld.
Grounds 2(a), (b) and (c)
Error in non-application of the s 299D(1)(c) requirement; failing to properly take into account the s 299D(2) factors; and failing to properly take into account the confidential affidavit
71Grounds 2(a), (b) and (c) contend that the trial judge erred in failing to consider the paragraph (c) requirement of s 299D(1), when determining whether to grant leave to produce documents under s 298(2), and thus the trial judge's exercise of discretion miscarried.  It is also contended that his Honour erred by failing to properly take into account the s 299D(2) factors and the applicant's confidential affidavit.  
72The Court's satisfaction of the requirements in s 299D(1) is a precondition of the exercise of the discretionary power under s 298(2) to allow access to the subpoenaed material to the parties.  The discretionary decision of the trial judge to allow access to the subpoenaed material is reviewable in the present case, relevantly, if the judge acted upon a wrong principle or if he did not take into account some material consideration: House v The King [1936] HCA [40]; 55 CLR 499 at 505.
73The error in the trial judge's approach is said to be revealed in the passages of the judgment of 1 August 2013 (at p 5) referred to at [41]-[44] above where, in reference to the s 299D(1)(c) requirement, his Honour stated that this only had application at the later stage of seeking leave to adduce evidence under s 298(3).
74The respondent submitted that there was no error by the trial judge in failing to apply the paragraph (c) requirement, because his Honour referred to the s 299D(2) factors as a relevant matter and stated that he had taken the confidential affidavit into account.  However, this submission ignored the terms of the paragraph (c) requirement.  
75This required his Honour to consider the two competing public interests, with access to the subpoenaed material being conditional upon the public interest in protection of confidences being ""substantially outweighed"" by the interest in admitting the material into evidence.  As explained by Basten JA in KS v Veitch (No 2) at [34], the former public interest has two limbs: the first addresses the public interest in maintaining protected confidences generally, while the second relates to possible harm to the particular confider.  
76It is tolerably clear, in my view, that his Honour erred in his approach to the paragraph (c) requirement of s 299D(1), because he considered that it only had application at the later stage of adducing of evidence under s 298(3), with a grant of leave.  The correct position is that the paragraph (c) requirement also applies at the earlier stage of allowing access to the subpoenaed material under s 298(2).  
77The trial judge erred, in my view, because he did not undertake the balancing exercise required by the paragraph (c) requirement.  This includes, but is not limited to, taking into account the s 299D(2) factors, when determining the public interest in preserving confidentiality of the protected confidence and protecting the principal protected confider from harm.  Although his Honour referred to the s 299D(2) factors as being a relevant matter, his reasons do not disclose whether he in fact took into account any of those factors, and if so, how those factors impacted upon his assessment of the balancing of the public interests referred to in the paragraph (c) requirement.
78As to whether the trial judge failed to take into account the confidential affidavit, the applicant contends that he only took this into account when considering s 302 of the Act, and the appropriate limits to be placed on access to the subpoenaed material.  His Honour's reasons are open to this interpretation.  However, due to the brevity of those reasons, it is difficult to determine whether, and if so, how his Honour may have otherwise taken the confidential affidavit into account.  
79It is unnecessary to reach a concluded view on this particular complaint, in view of my conclusion that his Honour erred in finding that the paragraph (c) requirement in s 299D(1), was not relevant when considering a grant of leave for production under s 298(2).
80Grounds 2(a) and (b) of the appeal should be upheld.
Grounds 3(a), (b) and (c)
Error in granting leave to produce material that may disclose prior sexual experience
Error in finding that material that may disclose a sexual experience in the circumstances of this matter had ""substantial probative value"" 
Error by not applying s 299D(1)(c) to material that may disclose prior sexual experience.  
81Grounds 3(a), (b) and (c) contend that the trial judge erred in allowing access to subpoenaed material that may disclose a prior sexual history, notwithstanding the inadmissibility of such material under s 293 of the Act, unless it fell within one of the exceptions in s 293(4) or s 293(6).  
82In short, it was contended that the trial judge erred by deferring consideration of the s 293 admissibility issue to the stage of adducing evidence under s 298(3), with leave of the Court.
83The relevant passage of the trial judge's reasons in his judgment of 1 August 2013 (at pp 6-7) stated:
""'So having taken into account all the matters required of me in respect of the division there is one subsequent matter that I need to deal with which is that the material discloses material that may not be 'adducible', if such a term exists, in evidence in the trial by virtue of s293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. That is material of prior sexual history.
In discussion with counsel I have concluded that there is no bar, apart from the Division 2 process, for the production of such material. Other criteria are to be applied in respect of the adducing of such evidence. There are certain rigid tests and an overriding, I will call it discretionary although it may simply be a test on its own, for the use of that material in a trial. That point has not been reached. Therefore I will allow access to the material which seems to me to be intimately bound up with the issues to which I have already referred. In this predictive phase they do have substantial value.
However there may be material that a final claim may be made by the confider 's representative and I am prepared to stay the order for a day so that a final review of the material, which, as I say, is voluminous, can be undertaken and any final claim for exclusion on the basis that it does not fit my ruling can be made.""
84The applicant's submissions highlighted that the trial judge subsequently observed in his judgment of 2 August 2013, that there may be an issue in respect of s 293 in respect of some of the material produced by the Northern Sydney Local Health District (at p 1) and the North Sydney Central Coast Health Services (at p 6).
85The trial judge's observation in respect of the s 293 issue was undoubtedly in response to the particular objections taken by the applicant's solicitor on 2 August 2013, to material marked with blue tags that included prior sexual experience, prior medical issues related to sexual experience and prior sexual assaults.  The applicant submitted before the trial judge that such material ""would have no purpose but to embarrass, shame and humiliate the complainant"".  
86It is clear that the trial judge did not address the s 293 issue either on 1 or 2 August 2013 when considering whether to allow access to the subpoenaed materials.  This was because his Honour took the view that s 293 was only relevant at the subsequent stage of adducing evidence at the trial.
87In my view, his Honour's approach was in error.  
88The assessment of ""substantial probative value"" under s 299D(1), whether at the stage of allowing production under s 298(2) or the stage of adducing of evidence under s 298(3), must be concerned with material that is ultimately admissible: KS v Veitch (No 2) at 266 [37]; NAR v PPC1 at [29].
89Evidence relating to sexual reputation, or disclosing or implying that the complainant may have had sexual experience, or lack of sexual experience, or may have taken part or not taken part in sexual activity, is inadmissible under s 293, unless one of the exceptions applies.  
90The restrictions on the admissibility of material concerning prior sexual assaults and prior sexual history, or lack of it, as found in s 293, also engage s 299D(1): NAR v PPC1 at [29].  It was necessary for his Honour to address the s 293 issue when determining whether the subpoenaed material had substantial probative value.  Given that his Honour did not do so, it follows that Grounds 3(a), (b) and (c) should be upheld.
91Counsel for the respondent contended that the trial judge adopted a pragmatic approach to Chapter 6, Part 5, Division 2 in dealing with the apparent difficulties in the application of s 299D(1) at the stage of allowing access to subpoenaed material under s 298(2).  It was suggested that s 302, which permitted the making of ancillary orders, was wide enough to permit access to the parties' legal representatives only, notwithstanding the absence of satisfaction of the paragraph (a) requirement of s 299D(1), in circumstances where the s 293 issue had been deferred to the stage of adducing of evidence at the trial.  
92In my view, there is simply no warrant for such an approach to the requirements in s 299D(1).  
93First, it is inconsistent with the terms of s 299B(3)(b) which are set out at [27] above.  The preconditions in s 299D(1) for the grant of leave under s 298(2) must be satisfied before access to subpoenaed materials recording a protected confidence can be granted to a party, other than a protected confider (such as the applicant).  Access cannot be granted to the parties' legal representatives in advance of the Court being satisfied that the preconditions in s 299D(1) have been satisfied.
94Secondly, to the extent that an application for access to subpoenaed material under s 298(2) raises issues under s 293, including the potential application of the exceptions to the inadmissibility of prior sexual history under s 293(4) and s 293(6), these must be addressed by the Court as part of the assessment of the ""substantial probative value"" requirement in paragraph (a) of s 299D(1).
95Thirdly, the power to make ancillary orders under s 302 ought not be construed so as to circumvent the satisfaction of the preconditions in s 299D(1) to allowing production of subpoenaed material under s 298(3).  Section 302 is predicated on the Court having been satisfied, relevantly under s 298(2), that documents should be produced and made available for inspection.  That is, it is to be assumed that the preconditions in s 299D(1) have been satisfied.  Section 302 is concerned with orders directed to limiting harm or potential harm from such disclosure of a ""protected confidence"".
96If the evidence in support of the application for leave to access the subpoenaed material under s 298(2) does not permit the trial judge to reach a view on the admissibility issue raised by s 293, then generally, the appropriate course would be to defer the application for access under s 298(2) until a ruling on admissibility under s 293 is made.  The timing of any such ruling, whether pre-trial or during the trial, is a matter for case management by the trial judge.
Orders
97The orders that I propose are:
(1)Grant the applicant leave to appeal, pursuant to s 5F(3AB) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, from the interlocutory judgment of the District Court delivered on 2 August 2013.
(2)Appeal allowed.
(3)Set aside the orders of McClintock DCJ dated 2 August 2013, except insofar as the orders permit access to the parties' legal representatives only to such of the subpoenaed documents in respect of which the applicant made no objection to access being granted (being those documents tagged by the applicant's solicitor with a green coloured flag for the purpose of identification).
(4)The application for leave to produce documents under s 298(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 is referred back to the trial judge for reconsideration in the light of this Court's rulings.
98R A HULME J:  I agree with Gleeson JA.
99ADAMSON J:  I agree.

2705821,Weatherall v R [2013] NSWCCA 282,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL: Offence and sentenceThe applicant was convicted after a trial by jury of two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse in company (deprivation of liberty before offence), contrary to s61JA Crimes Act 1900.  The offences carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  
2On 20 September 2007 the applicant was sentenced by Woods QC DCJ to an overall term of imprisonment of 15 years with a non-parole period of 10 years.  With respect to count 1, the applicant received a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years with an additional term of 5 years.  With respect to count 2, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years with an additional term of 5 years.  The sentence in respect of count 1 was to commence on 2 December 2005 and that in respect of count 2 on 2 December 2007.  The total non-parole period will expire on 1 December 2015 and the balance of term on 1 December 2020.  The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against the severity of those sentences.  
3The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
Ground 1:  The sentencing judge erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120
Ground 2:  The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, whether taken:(a) individually; and/or(b)  in combination.
4The Crown does not accept that ""Muldrock error"" occurred.  In the alternative, if ""Muldrock error"" is found to have occurred, the Crown does not accept that pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour is warranted in law.  In relation to ""Muldrock error"", this judgment should be read with Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19] - [28].  The Crown opposed the granting of an extension of time.
Factual background to the offences
5The applicant, together with his co-offender King, was convicted in relation to events which occurred at Eveleigh Street, Redfern.  There on or about 24 November 2005 the applicant was the leader of a group of men who prevented the victim, RK, from leaving a terrace house in order to have sexual intercourse with her without her consent.  
6The victim was a drug addict and had attended the area looking to obtain heroin to support her habit.  She had been for some weeks a regular visitor to ""The Block"" area of Redfern, obtaining heroin to feed her addiction.  The applicant and King were either small scale drug dealers or knew where to obtain heroin. 
7The victim's evidence, which the jury must have accepted, was that having been detained in the Eveleigh Street terrace, the applicant said to her ""You're staying here.  You're going nowhere.""  He took her into a room with a single bed behind the door and started to pull her clothes off.  As he did this, he unzipped his own pants, took his penis out and forced the victim to perform oral sex on him while she was sitting on the bed.
8He made her do this by grabbing her hair and twisting it around his hands so that she could not move.  He pushed her head up and down on his penis.  He was saying things like ""Oh you like that don't you?"".  At the time she was aware that there was someone else in the room, sitting on a chair on the right side of the room watching what was happening.  As the applicant was forcing her to perform oral sex, the victim described how he was trying to make her gag, pushing his penis ""so far down my throat that I couldn't breathe ... he just kept forcing, really forcefully"".   The applicant ejaculated onto a towel.
9This act was count 1 on the indictment.   The victim noticed at the time she was made to perform oral sex that the applicant's penis had ""lumps"" on it, being quite large and obvious and extending for about three-quarters of its length.  
10After this the victim became aware of someone other than the applicant, who had come up and sat on the bed.   That man then lay back on the bed and unzipped his pants, putting his hands behind his head.  The victim described being pulled over by someone else again, who had grabbed her hair and positioned her between this other man's knees.  The victim's evidence was that this other man was ""pushing"", he had a fist full of her hair and was ""just forcing my head up and down on this man's penis as well"".  She described a number of other people in the room, including the applicant, whom she said was there almost the whole time and a young person about 16 years old.  King was the person on whom the victim was forced to perform oral sex on this occasion.  These were the facts relating to count 2 and the applicant was sentenced as a principal in the second degree in relation to that offence.
11While these offences were taking place, the victim described conversations she heard the applicant having with others.  She said that the applicant was on the phone and was telling other people to ""come over and have a go"" ... ""there's a girl here, have a go"" ... ""bro come over quick"".
12The victim was moved from the bedroom to an adjacent room.  Present in that room was an Islander male, Qoro, together with the younger unidentified man who had been in the bedroom.  Qoro forced her to perform oral sex on him.  During that act, the younger man attempted to force her head onto his penis.
13After this episode, she was released by another man who gave her money to get home.  She left and a good samaritan found her distressed and crying outside her home in Eveleigh Street and took her inside.  The victim made immediate complaint to the good samaritan who reported the matter to the police.  
14Initially the applicant and Qoro faced trial before Judge Berman SC and a jury on 28 August 2006.  For reasons not relevant, the jury was discharged in relation to the applicant.  Qoro, however, was convicted of aggravated sexual assault in company (deprivation of liberty before offence) and on 27 April 2007 was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years.  Qoro's appeal from his conviction and sentence was dismissed (Qoro v R [2008] NSWCCA 220).
15A further trial commenced on 14 May 2007 before Woods DCJ QC and a jury in which the applicant and King were jointly tried in relation to an indictment containing two counts.  As already indicated, the applicant was convicted of both counts.  King was convicted of one such count being the second count on the indictment.  King was sentenced to imprisonment for 13 years with a non-parole period of 8 years.   King appealed against his sentence and on 10 March 2010 this Court delivered judgment granting an extension of time for leave to appeal but dismissing the appeal (King v R [2010] NSWCCA 33).
Applicant's Subjective Case
16In relation to his subjective case, the applicant was aged 31 at the time of the offences and 33 when sentenced.  He had prior offences for robbery and wounding but no offences were recorded against him for the seven years before these offences.  Both the applicant and the victim were of Aboriginal background.  In that regard, the Court took account of the problems the applicant had experienced while growing up and concluded that his frequenting of ""The Block"" at Redfern was related to drug and alcohol abuse but was also a place of ""Aboriginal gathering in Sydney where they were unlikely to be taunted racially"".
17The applicant gave evidence that while in custody he was in ""protection"" but that upon sentence, he expected to be placed in Limited Association or Non Association Protection, as a result of the nature of the offences.  The applicant gave evidence that even if he were not placed in protective custody, he would seek it himself because of the real risk of physical harm to himself arising from the nature of the offences.
18While in custody, the applicant had managed to obtain a position of responsibility as the ""Koori"" delegate, concerned with the welfare of Aboriginal inmates.  By reference to the support which the applicant continued to enjoy from his family, and the material regarding the applicant's post-offence conduct while in custody, the sentencing judge found that he had ""reasonable prospects of rehabilitation in due course"".
19The sentencing judge determined that special circumstances existed in the applicant's case, being:
(i) The applicant's background of disadvantage.
(ii) The need for the applicant to undertake drug and alcohol counselling.
(iii) The applicant's need for an extended period of post-release supervision.
20The sentencing judge made the following further findings of fact.  He found that the victim had voluntarily attended the house with the idea that she could somehow get drugs there.  The applicant and the co-offenders committed the offences because they regarded the complainant as ""an easy mark"" because she was ""vulnerable and desperate"".  They took advantage of her and regarded it as unnecessary to provide her with drugs or seek consent prior to sexual intercourse with her.  His Honour found that the offenders were probably emboldened by the assumption that she would either not complain or if she did, would not be believed.
21All the offenders had been drinking for a significant amount of time before the offence.  There were a number of men in the house.  His Honour found these to be crimes of opportunity and not pre-planned or premeditated.  The applicant was found to be the ringleader ""in that he encouraged several other men to participate in the crimes"" and was the ""main promoter of the misconduct proven in the trial"".  This was so notwithstanding that the other two offenders sentenced, King and Qoro, were willing participants.
Background to this application
22After having been sentenced on 20 September 2007, the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in respect of his conviction and sentence on 9 October 2007.  On 17 September 2009 the applicant was informed that he did not qualify for legal aid for an appeal.  
23On 12 June 2013 the applicant was advised that his case had been reviewed by Legal Aid NSW's Standard Non-parole Period Sentence Review Team and he was invited to complete a further application for legal aid.  In due course he did so which resulted in this matter coming before the Court.
Delay
24The sentence was imposed on 20 September 2007.  The Notice of Intention to Appeal lapsed on 9 April 2008.  Accordingly, an extension of time of over 6 years is sought for this application for Leave to Appeal Against Sentence.
25The competing submissions in relation to delay, finality and the Court's consideration of those submissions are set out in Abdul v R at [31] - [53].  Those submissions and the Court's conclusions in relation thereto are incorporated into this judgment.
26The extent of the delay is substantial and the explanation for it is not compelling.  Having considered the circumstances relating to the applicant's sentence, Legal Aid NSW rejected his application as having insufficient prospects of success.  The only change to those circumstances is the decision in Muldrock.  The principle of finality stands against an extension of time, as does the potential for further psychological suffering by the victim.  This latter consideration is a matter of considerable significance, given the facts relating to this offence.
27In those circumstances, if ""Muldrock error"" is established and it is necessary for this Court to re-exercise the sentencing discretion, the question of whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted is determinative.  None of the other factors identified in the decided cases favour the granting of an extension of time.
Was there ""Muldrock error""?
28The applicant submitted that his Honour's sentencing discretion miscarried by reason of him:
(a) Giving determinative significance to the standard non-parole period.
(b) Adopting a two-stage approach to sentencing.
(c) Determining the sentence imposed on the basis that the standard non-parole period had an application to an offence within the mid-range of objective seriousness, following conviction after trial, unless there were reasons to depart from it.
29The applicant noted that his Honour discussed what the legislature meant by the expression ""mid-range of objective seriousness"" and found problems whichever way he approached its interpretation.  It was his Honour's conclusion on that issue which the applicant submitted demonstrated ""Muldrock error"".
""The approach I adopt is this:  in my view each of these offences justifies a non-parole period significantly below the standard non-parole period of 15 years because it was in the words of s21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act ""not part of a planned or organised criminal activity"".  Rather, it was a fortuitous event which occurred because of the random chance that the complainant turned up at [the premises] when there was a drinking session in progress, and advantage was taken of her.  Although the event occurred in company for the purposes of s61JA, the ""company"" was a party of drunken louts, not ""organised criminal activity"".  As nasty and violent as it was, it was not ""organised"".  
Either the objective seriousness of the offence is reduced by this consideration such that it falls below the ""middle range of objective seriousness"" and is not a ""mid-range"" offence at all, so that the court may therefore set a shorter non-parole period than the standard non-parole period; or it falls within a fairly broad range of offences which are of middle range of objective seriousness, but under s53B the court may set a shorter non-parole period, provided the reasons for doing so are recorded consistently with s54B(4).
Whichever approach is taken, I would reach the same result.  It is proper for me to reduce the non-parole period I will impose in sentencing on each count and I intend to do so. (ROS 17.9 - 18.8)
30The applicant submitted that the reference at the end of the quoted passage showed that the sentencing judge gave determinative significance or primacy to the standard non-parole period.  He submitted that this was indicative that his Honour started with the standard non-parole period and then adjusted it to take into account other factors.  
31I am not satisfied that ""Muldrock error"" has occurred, as submitted by the applicant.  Even if it has occurred, it is clear from the structure of these sentences that it was an error of process only, not a material error.  The effect of his Honour's reasoning was that the standard non-parole period simply did not apply and his Honour effectively ignored it.
32The observations of Davies J (with whom Whealy JA and Rothman J agreed) in Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23 have resonance in relation to this case:
""26 ... Merely showing that a sentencing judge sentenced pre- Muldrock following the dictates of Way will not be sufficient to demonstrate error.  What should be ascertained in each case is whether a reliance on Way has sufficiently infected a sentence with such error that this Court must intervene.  Ordinarily this might occur in cases where an applicant is found guilty by a jury, with the result that the sentencing judge will have considered that a two-stage process must be applied and that the standard non-parole period is mandatory unless factors can be found to justify a variation from it.  It is far less likely that intervention will be required from this Court where a sentence has been imposed following a plea of guilty and the sentencing judge has referred to the standard non-parole period as simply a guideline or yardstick.""
33In Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 Bellew J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said:
""30 ... when considering whether or not such an error has been established, it is necessary to consider the reasons of the sentencing judge as a whole.""
34In KG v R [2012] NSWCCA 10 Basten JA (RS Hulme and Schmidt JJ agreeing) said:
""20 Had the trial judge given any significant weight to the standard non-parole period, it may well be he would have erred. However, it does not appear that it had significant weight in the circumstances of the case.  The standard non-parole period was seven years; the starting point for his calculation of the overall sentence was more than two years below the standard non-parole period; both the sentence and non-parole period imposed were so far below the standard non-parole period that it is not possible to infer that the standard non-parole period was given any significant weight in the exercise of sentencing.  This ground is without substance.""
35In the present case, his Honour summarised the facts by reference to the victim's evidence at trial and made findings of fact, some of which were quite favourable to the applicant.  He made reference to aggravating and mitigating factors in relation to the applicant.  He took into account the applicant's subjective features.  His Honour then turned to the applicable legislation, referring specifically to the maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and to the standard non-parole period.  His Honour next determined an appropriate sentence for each count, found special circumstances and set out what he regarded as an appropriate level of accumulation.
36This is very much the process of ""instinctive synthesis"" described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 which was expressly approved in Muldrock.  His Honour did not consider that it was mandatory to impose the standard non-parole period.  On the contrary, he reasoned in such a way that the standard non-parole period did not apply.  In reality, his Honour was doing exactly what was required of him by both Markarian and Muldrock.
37There are a number of decisions of this Court that post-date the decision in Muldrock to the effect that it is not an inappropriate exercise for a sentencing judge to make an evaluation of the objective seriousness of an offence (Zarakas v R [2013] NSWCCA 144 at [35]).  In particular, his Honour did not ""attribute mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period"", nor commence with the question of whether there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, nor adopt a two-stage approach:  FP v R [2012] NSWCCA 182 at [318] per McClellan CJ at CL (Schmidt and RA Hulme JJ agreeing).
38A fair reading of the remarks on sentence as a whole indicates that his Honour in fact engaged in that process of ""instinctive synthesis"".  To the extent that he may have erred in his overall discussion of the standard non-parole period and the legislation giving rise to it, it was no more than an error of process and had no material effect on the sentences imposed.
39For the above reasons, I am not satisfied that ""Muldrock error"" has been established.  That being so, Ground of Appeal 1 has not been made out.
40If I am wrong in that finding, and it is necessary to determine pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act whether a lesser sentence was warranted in law, I am not so satisfied.
41In relation to objective seriousness, the finding by the sentencing judge that the offending was below the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of this kind was particularly generous.  Were I re-exercising the sentencing discretion, I would have found the objective seriousness of the offence to be significantly higher.
42Even allowing for the subjective features of the applicant's case, particularly the difficulties associated with his childhood and background, the criminality of this offence was substantial.  The victim was detained and sexually violated while others watched over a sustained period of time.  As the ringleader and promoter of the offending, the actions of the applicant were particularly callous, not only in relation to what he personally did to the victim, but in summoning others to participate in her further degradation.  In my opinion, no lesser sentence was warranted in law than that passed by the sentencing judge.
Ground 2:  The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, whether taken:(a) individually; and/or(b)  in combination.
43Since ""Muldrock error"" has not been made out, it should be noted that when considering this Ground of Appeal, different considerations apply to those which would have applied had Ground 1 been made out.  Before there can be any consideration of re-sentencing in relation to Ground of Appeal 2, error on the part of the sentencing judge has to be demonstrated.  
44In oral submissions, counsel for the applicant did not challenge the individual sentences.  What he challenged was the level of accumulation.  He submitted that accumulating the sentences by 2 years was excessive.
45He submitted that the offences occurred within a very short period of time of each other and that the applicant was found to be a principal in the second degree in relation to the second offence.  Counsel conceded that there may have needed to be some accumulation, but that the gravity of the second offence was comprehended by the sentence imposed on the co-offender.  He submitted that if it were not, those sentences would be inadequate because both of those persons attacked the victim who already had her liberty deprived and had suffered the first outrage (AT 6.17).
46Counsel for the applicant did not submit that the sentences should have been entirely concurrent, but that the extent of the accumulation was excessive.
47Once some level of accumulation is conceded, its extent was very much a matter of discretion.  In that regard, I adhere to what I said in Franklin v R [2013] NSWCCA 122 (Hall and Davies JJ agreeing):
""42 As senior counsel for the applicant appreciated, there is no general rule of law that determines whether a sentence must be concurrent or consecutive: Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at [47]. The decision is a discretionary one. The overarching principle was enunciated by Howie J in R v Jarrold [2010] NSWCCA 69 at [56] where he said that concurrency should not be imposed:

""... simply because of the similarity of the conduct or because it may be seen as part of one course of criminal conduct ... The question to be asked is, can the sentence for one offence encompass the criminality of all the offences?""
43 As this Court has said on many occasions, and as was said again in LG v R [2012] NSWCCA 249:

""24 ...  the decision as to whether to accumulate in respect of multiple sentences is fundamentally an exercise within the discretion of the sentencing judge.  As Simpson J observed in R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; 118 A Crim R 66 at [7] ""There will be many cases in which sentencing judges might take differing views but neither view could be said to be wrong.""
25  The issue of totality, particularly in a case involving sexual offending, was discussed by this Court in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; 164 A Crim R 326 at [13] where Spigelman CJ (Whealy and Howie JJ agreeing) stated:
""In some cases the fact that a sentence for a particular offence is to be served completely concurrently with another sentence for a different offence will result in a sentence that is erroneously inadequate because it does not reflect the totality of the criminality for which the offender was to be punished for the two acts of offending ... This may be so even if the two offences arise from the same precise criminal act, such as the dangerous driving of a motor vehicle on the one occasion... The same principle has been applied to sexual assault offences arising from a single incident of sexual assault: R v Gorman [2002] NSWCCA 516; 137 A Crim R 326."" 
26  In Gorman Sperling J said at [57]:
""Relevantly the offences in the present case were committed in the course of the same episode.  His Honour so found.  However, each offence contributed to the total criminality involved and care had to be taken to ensure that the overall effective sentence was appropriate having regard to the offences which were committed in the course of that episode.""""
48As was properly conceded by counsel, the application of the above principles warranted a degree of accumulation to reflect the total criminality involved in the two offences.  Once that is accepted, the extent of the accumulation was within the discretion of the sentencing judge.  The fact that the applicant was the ringleader, was present when the second offence occurred and that the second offence contributed to the further degradation of the victim, adequately justified a level of accumulation of 2 years.  This is so despite the fact that the two discrete criminal offences were committed against the same victim at about the same time and involved the same sexual act.
49It follows that no error on the part of the sentencing judge has been established and that this ground of appeal has not been made out.
Conclusion
50To allow this application for leave to appeal against sentence to proceed would be futile in that it has no prospects of success.  
51The order which I propose is that the application for extension of time be dismissed.
52JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
53BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2705823,O'Grady v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 281,"Judgment1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bellew J.
2JOHNSON J: I agree with Bellew J.
3BELLEW J: Following a trial, the applicant was convicted of an offence of specially aggravated break and enter contrary to s. 112(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The offence was carried out in the company of two other persons, Bradley Carter (""Carter"") and Robert Puha (""Puha"").  
4The offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 8 years imprisonment.
5The applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Murrell to a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months imprisonment, with an additional term of 3 years and 6 months.  He is eligible for release on parole on 22 November 2015.
6The applicant seeks an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed.  The background to that application is set out in an affidavit of the applicant of 20 September 2013 along with an affidavit of Ruth Chalmers, solicitor, of 20 September 2013.  In summary, shortly after he was sentenced the applicant instructed his then legal representatives to lodge a notice of intention to appeal against conviction and sentence.  As events transpired, the appeal proceeded as one against conviction only.  The applicant is not able to recall why it was that no application for leave to appeal against sentence was pursued.  The appeal against conviction was dismissed by this Court on 30 September 2012 (see O'Grady v R [2012] NSWCCA 62).
7The applicant was advised by Ms Chalmers in February 2013 that there was likely merit in an application for leave to appeal against sentence on the basis of a so-called ""Muldrock error"" (see Muldrock v R (2011) 244 CLR 120; [2011] HCA 39).  In Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 this Court explained in detail the background to, and the general nature of, such errors.       
8Having received such advice from Ms Chalmers, the applicant completed an application for legal aid and thereafter the necessary documentation was obtained by Ms Chalmers, counsel briefed and submissions prepared.  A Notice of application for leave to appeal was filed on 28 June 2013.  
9The Crown has opposed the grant of an extension of time.  
THE FACTS10The following summary is taken from the remarks on sentence.
11The victim, Brett Davis, lived with his partner in a secure apartment complex in Wolli Creek.  On the night of 12 May 2008 the victim was at home alone when he heard a knock at the door.  Upon opening it, he was confronted by three men who entered the premises.  In the course of the attack which followed, the victim was rendered unconscious.  He was subsequently hospitalised for a number of days, having suffered (inter alia) lacerations to the face and scalp (some of which required suturing) as well as a fractured right orbital floor.  
12An inspection of the victim's apartment by police disclosed the presence of blood in and about the premises.  Puha's fingerprints were found in various places inside.  The right palm print and the left index fingerprint of the applicant were found on the interior of the door of the premises.  
13Investigations led police to speak with Carter and Puha who were identified as two occupants of a stolen vehicle which was seen in and around the area of the victim's premises at the time of the commission of the offence.  Police located a number of items identified as having been taken from the victim's premises within that stolen vehicle.
14When charged, Puha pleaded guilty and gave evidence for the Crown in the applicant's trial.  His evidence, which the jury obviously accepted as accurate and truthful, was critical to the Crown case.  
15Puha gave evidence that on the evening in question he was in the company of Carter and the applicant (to whom he referred as ""Ace"").  A substantial quantity of drugs and alcohol had been consumed before the trio ""did a journey"" which involved driving around for approximately 2 hours in the stolen vehicle.  Their reason for doing so was connected to the fact that the applicant was said to have been in a ""bad drug deal"" and wanted to ""rectify the situation with the dealer"".  The applicant told Puha that he wanted to ""sort it out"" with the dealer and that he wanted Puha there as ""the muscle"".  
16After driving around for some time, the trio arrived in the vicinity of the victim's premises.  They gained entry through the car park and then through the fire escape. The door leading from the fire escape into the residential section of the building was locked, but the applicant produced a screwdriver or similar implement which he used to try and force open the door.  Carter and Puha were on the verge of abandoning the attempted entry when the applicant succeeded in getting the door open. 
17All three of them then proceeded to the victim's apartment where they barged inside when the victim opened the door.  The victim was pushed back onto a couch, and one of the three (whom the sentencing judge found was ""probably"" the applicant) demanded:  
""Where's the money?  Where's the drugs?"" 
18The situation then erupted, with the victim becoming agitated and trying to fend off the three intruders.  A significant assault ensued, which resulted in the victim's blood being splattered over his premises and the victim losing consciousness.  Puha described the victim as ""a mess"". 
19The applicant, Carter and Puha then commenced searching the premises, and randomly removed a number of objects including a television and a DVD player.  They then drove away.
The findings of the sentencing judge  20The sentencing judge noted that the applicant was 23 years of age at the time of commission of the offence.  There were only three prior matters on his criminal history although at the time of the offending he was on a bond pursuant to s. 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) which had been imposed for an offence of shoplifting.
21A report from Dr Jacmon, psychologist, was before the sentencing judge.  That report recorded that in July 2007 the applicant had witnessed the stabbing murder of his then partner, following which he commenced to use drugs heavily and suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.  Dr Jacmon thought that the applicant would benefit from cognitive therapy.  The subject offence had been committed about 10 months after the death of the applicant's former partner.  The applicant had since formed another relationship and his new partner was pregnant with his child.  
22In terms of the applicant's offending, her Honour found (commencing at ROS 6, paragraph [15]) that it was in the mid range.  In reaching that finding her Honour had regard to the number of persons in company, the manner of entry into the victim's premises, the theft of property and the treatment of the victim.  Although there were no long term consequences for the victim from the injuries he sustained, her Honour took into account the fact that the offending nevertheless involved a serious and unprovoked attack upon the victim in his own home.  
23Her Honour also found that as the person who was motivated to seek out the victim, the applicant was the ""orchestrator"".  This was in contrast to Carter, whom her Honour found to be a ""follower"".  In this regard her Honour noted, in particular, that the applicant had been equipped with a screwdriver or some similar object which enabled him to force entry into the victim's premises.  
THE GROUND OF APPEALHer Honour erred in her approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120
The approach of the sentencing judge24At ROS 1, paragraph [2] her Honour said:
""The offence carries a maximum available penalty of twentyfive years imprisonment and a standard nonparole period of seven years imprisonment.  The standard nonparole period of seven years represents the nonparole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of this type.  When determining the sentence for the offence, the Court is to set the standard nonparole period unless the Court determines that there are reasons for setting a nonparole period that is longer or shorter than a standard nonparole period. The relevant reasons are confined to those referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999"". 
Submissions of the parties25It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the passage in [24] above reflected (inter alia) the adoption of a two stage approach to sentencing in which, having determined the standard non-parole period, her Honour considered whether there were reasons for departing from it.  It was submitted that such an approach, although in accordance with the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, was erroneous in light of the decision in Muldrock. 26The Crown conceded that the sentencing judge had erred in the manner for which the applicant contended.
Consideration and conclusion 27The Crown's concession was a proper one.  It is evident from the passage relied upon by the applicant that her Honour erred.  Moreover, the error was clearly a material one (see Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; (2007) 173 A Crim R 284 at [83] per Latham J).  
28Accordingly, this ground is made out.
THE APPLICATION TO EXTEND TIME29 In Abdul (supra) this Court said (at [53])
""Accordingly, when considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time"".
30In the present case the delay is well in excess of two years.  Although that is less than some of the periods of delay considered by this Court in cases of so-called Muldrock error, it is nevertheless substantial.  It is explained largely on the basis of a change in applicable sentencing principles following the decision in Muldrock.  
31No Victim Impact Statement was tendered before her Honour on sentence and there is no other evidence which might suggest that an extension of time would be likely to give rise to added trauma for the victim.  That said, such an order would offend the principle of finality.  In terms of their effect upon the application for an extension of time, all of these matters are fairly evenly balanced.  
32However for the reasons explained in Abdul, because a material error has been established it is necessary to assess the prospects of success of the application for leave to appeal.  In doing so, the Court must consider whether any other sentence is warranted in law (Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) s. 6(3)).
Is a lesser sentence warranted in law?Submissions of the parties33In addition to the matters contained in the lengthy written submissions which were filed, counsel for the applicant emphasised three aspects of the applicant's subjective case which, it was submitted, supported the conclusion that some lesser sentence was warranted.   
34The first was the applicant's age, he having been 23 years old at the time of the commission of the offence.  
35The second was what was described as the applicant's insignificant criminal record.  Counsel pointed out, in particular, that such record did not include any offences of violence and that the present offending should thus be regarded as being out of character.
36The third concerned the circumstances in which the applicant had witnessed the death of his former partner, and the post traumatic stress disorder and increased drug dependence which had resulted.  It was submitted that these circumstances were the real genesis of the offending.
37Counsel for the Crown relied upon the circumstances of the offending and the fact that there was significant violence.  In doing so, the Crown stressed that the offending was in the nature of a home invasion, and relied upon decisions of this Court in support of the submission that such offences must be treated seriously, representing as they do a breach of the fundamental entitlement of every citizen to feel safe in his or her own home.  
38The Crown also submitted that the offending was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was subject to conditional liberty at the time.  For all of these reasons, the Crown submitted that no lesser sentence was warranted.
CONSIDERATION AND CONCLUSION39In the course of submissions before this Court counsel for the applicant described the applicant's subjective case as ""compelling"".  It is true that one of the three subjective matters which were the focus of counsel's submissions, namely the results of the applicant having seen his former partner killed, was a unique circumstance.  However the remaining two matters relied upon by counsel, namely the applicant's age and his lack of prior criminal history, are the type of matters regularly considered by sentencing judges.  I do not, in these circumstances, regard the applicant's subjective case as compelling.
40In any event, it is clear from her express references to those matters that her Honour took all of them into account on sentence.  It is also noteworthy that there was no evidence which enabled her Honour to have regard to any expressed contrition or remorse on the part of the applicant.  
41Even when full weight is given to the fact that the applicant had no history of violence, his offending in the present case involved the infliction of serious injuries to the victim which rendered him unconscious and which saw him admitted to hospital for several days.  Moreover, there has been no challenge in this appeal to her Honour's findings (at ROS 6, paragraph [15]) that it was the applicant who was:
(i)motivated to seek out the victim;(ii)able to identify the victim's premises; and(iii)equipped with a screwdriver or similar implement in order to force entry.  
42It is apparent that these matters led her Honour to conclude (at ROS 6, paragraph [15]) that the applicant was the orchestrator of the offence, a finding which has also not been challenged.  
43This Court has consistently said that offending of this kind should meet with condign punishment.  For example, in R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740 Street CJ, in the context of observations regarding the increase in the commission of the offence of break, enter and steal observed (at 742):
""The invasion of people's homes and the plundering of their property is a social evil from which the community looks for protection to the law enforcement agencies and the criminal courts"".  
44In the same case, Lee J said (at 744):  
""The police and the criminal courts are all that a citizen has to look to protect him against the activities of criminals, and the courts have a duty to make clear that they recognise that, so far as our society is concerned, their prime responsibility is the protection of the community. (The sentencing judge's) remarks on sentence make quite clear that his Honour was not in doubt as to the court's responsibility.  The community has the right to expect that the courts will use against crime the weapons which it has at its disposal, and that it will take stern measures in the face of repeated defiant criminal conduct involving breaking and entering.""
45More recently, in Palijan v R [2010] NSWCCA 142 Barr AJ observed (at [22], McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J agreeing):
""It seems to me that a law-abiding member of the community is entitled to feel safe in his or her own home.  There is to my mind something particularly repugnant about the forced entry of an offender into a house and violating the safety of that place by carrying out an attack"".
46In my view, none of the matters advanced on behalf of the applicant support a conclusion that even if an extension of time was granted,  substantial injustice arises out of the sentence imposed, or that some other sentence is warranted in law.  
ORDER47I propose the following order:(i)The application for an extension of time is dismissed.

2705825,Ith v R [2013] NSWCCA 280,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:  Offence and sentence2The applicant was found guilty by a jury of one count of robbery in company causing grievous bodily harm, contrary to s98 of the Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years.  By virtue of s54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW)  (the CSP Act) that offence attracts a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
3On 6 March 2009 the applicant was sentenced by Sorby DCJ to a non-parole period of imprisonment for 6 years with a balance of term of 3 years.  The applicant is eligible for release to parole on 9 November 2014.
4In addition to the s98 offence, an offence of having custody of a knife in a public place was placed on a s166 Certificate.  This offence related to the applicant being in possession of a knife at the time of his arrest on 6 February 2007.  The applicant was sentenced to a concurrent fixed term of 6 months imprisonment for this offence.
5The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against the severity of that sentence.  The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120
Ground 2:  His Honour's discretion miscarried in his consideration of the commencement date of the sentence.
Ground 3:  His Honour erred by finding that parity was not in issue.
Ground 4:  The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentence imposed on the co-accused Dharma.
6It was common ground between the applicant and the Crown that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred in the sentencing process and that as a result Ground 1 had been made out.  On that issue generally this judgment should be read with that of Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.  The Crown, however, did not accept that, pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law.
Factual background to the offence
7The victim, Mr Nguyen, was in the poker machine section of the Cabramatta Inn Hotel between 1.30am and 3.25am on 1 February 2007.    Sena Dharma was in the poker machine section of the hotel between 1.30am and 3.30am.  The applicant, who had short dark hair, was also in the hotel in the poker machine area.
8At about 1.47am Dharma approached the victim, who was still at a poker machine, and asked him for a light which he gave to him.  The victim described Dharma to the police as having spoken in Vietnamese with a Northern Vietnamese accent.  At 2.05am Dharma approached the victim again and asked him for a cigarette.  The victim refused to give him one and told him to buy his own.
9The applicant then approached him and said in Vietnamese, spoken with a Cambodian accent, ""What do you want, do you want a fight or not?"" At 2.09 am the applicant can be seen on the CCTV footage standing behind the victim and appearing to watch him playing a poker machine for some minutes.
10At about 2.13am the victim won $1,000 while the applicant was still standing behind him.  He was paid out that amount in $50 notes by a cashier at 2.16am.  At the same time, Dharma walked past and looked down at the victim as the cashier handed him the money.  The victim then left the hotel, went to a nearby ATM and withdrew $1000 and put it in his front pocket.  He went back into the hotel and continued playing the poker machines.
11At 2.19am the applicant was again standing behind the victim, while the latter was playing a poker machine, and watched him for several minutes.  At 2.29am Dharma and the applicant were seen to approach the victim at the poker machine and appeared to have an argument with him.  Shortly after, a security officer, Mr Muagututia, approached Dharma and the applicant and tried to calm them down.  They told Mr Muagututia that they had asked the victim for a lighter and he told them to ""fuck off"".
12At about 3.23am the victim was paid out another $460 from the poker machine by the cashier.  CCTV footage showed the applicant walking past the victim at that time and looking towards him as he was being paid.  Shortly thereafter, the victim left the hotel through the Railway Parade exit and walked towards Old Cabramatta Road.
13The applicant and Dharma followed the victim through the same Railway Parade exit.  Both of them ran after the victim.  As the victim walked along Old Cabramatta Road West, he heard a voice call out ""Hey come back"".  He turned around and saw the applicant, who ran towards him and said ""Do you want to fight?""
14The victim turned to run but before he could do so, the applicant attacked him.  The applicant struck a strong blow to the left side of the victim's face, causing him to fall to the ground.  The victim looked up and saw the applicant lift up his shirt and pull out a knife from the front part of his jeans.  The applicant raised the knife and made a screaming-type noise.
15The knife was about 8 inches long and had a smooth edge and the blade was pointed.  Upon seeing the knife, the victim became very scared and momentarily lost consciousness.  When he came to, he got up and ran along Old Cabramatta Road West, towards Acacia Street.  As he ran he heard someone following him and calling out in Vietnamese ""Stop"" and then he heard another voice calling out in Vietnamese ""Hey, hey"".  He turned around and saw an object coming towards him and realised it was his wallet.  He picked it up, checked that his cards were still in it, but saw that the $460 had gone.  He continued running along Acacia Street towards Bolivia Street.  As he did so, he turned around and saw the applicant in a crouching position.
16The victim continued to run along Acacia Street with the applicant running behind him.  When he reached Bolivia Street, somebody grabbed him by the shoulder and he yelled out ""Help"" and threw his arms out to try to push the person away.  He saw the person's legs and feet in front of him and then he felt himself being pushed from his right side by a second person.  The victim fell to the ground and landed on all fours.  At that point, he was kicked very hard to the right side of the face, around his eye, by the applicant.
17As a result of the kick to his right eye, the victim suffered a tear in the retina of that eye, which was subsequently repaired by laser surgery.  That was the injury relied upon in the offence.
18The victim then received another kick to the head from the applicant who said ""Why do you tell lies?""  The victim then felt someone put a hand into his front, left jeans pocket and take his money - the $1000 he had withdrawn from the ATM machine and the $1000 which he had initially won on the poker machines.  The victim then passed out.  When he regained consciousness he was in the middle of the road on his own.  He called triple O and managed to crawl home.  When the police and an ambulance subsequently arrived, it was discovered that in addition to the retinal tear of his right eye, he also suffered a fractured left orbital socket, two black eyes, cuts around his left eye, facial swelling and bruising and bleeding from his ear and nose.
19The applicant and Dharma were subsequently arrested when they again attended the Cabramatta Inn some days later.
20The following matters are relevant to the applicant's subjective case.  The applicant was 25 years old at the time of the offence and 27 at the time of sentence.  He was born in a refugee camp in Thailand to Cambodian parents.  When he was six, his parents moved to New Zealand and later to Australia where his parents separated.  He completed school to year 10 but later obtained his Higher School Certificate and completed an Automotive Engineering course at TAFE.
21The applicant had a history of drug abuse.  He completed two home detoxification programs.  He denied his involvement in the offences and did not express contrition or remorse.  The author of the pre-sentence report said that he would benefit from participation in intensive drug and alcohol programs.  A psychologist's report stated that he would need extensive and regular counselling on his release.
22At the time of the offence, he was on parole for three counts of armed robbery, having received a sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months.  He was released to parole on 9 October 2006, 4 months before this offence.  It was accepted that this was a matter in aggravation of the offence.
23The applicant swore an affidavit on 16 October 2013 relating to his time in prison.  The effect of that affidavit was that he was dealing with his incarceration reasonably well.  His biggest issue was that he did not see very much of his family and was concerned about his mother who was not in good health.  He said that he tried not to use drugs while in custody, but occasionally found it difficult when he was under stress.  While in prison he had completed the Getting SMART program and a course in basic adult education.  His custodial record recorded five urine test failures between December 2010 and January 2013.  
24The findings by the sentencing judge were that this was an objectively serious offence.  He characterised it as a vicious attack where general deterrence would be particularly important.  His Honour characterised the offence as falling below the mid-range of objective seriousness, but close to it.  His Honour did not regard his prospects of rehabilitation as being particularly good.  His Honour did, however, find that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity.
25The co-accused Dharma pleaded guilty in the District Court to an offence of robbery in company, contrary to s97 of the Act.  The maximum penalty for that offence is 20 years imprisonment.  He was sentenced by Keleman DCJ on 31 October 2008 to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months.
Background to this application
26After being sentenced on 6 March 2009 the applicant brought proceedings in this Court for an application for extension of time for leave to appeal against his conviction.  That application was heard on 3 November 2011.  On 26 April 2012 that application was refused (Ith v R [2012] NSWCCA 70).
27Paragraph [3] is instructive.  There McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Adams J and I agreed) said:
""3 A Notice of Application for Extension of Time to file a Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed on 28 July 2011. It was accompanied by an affidavit sworn by the applicant's solicitor. The picture presented is of a failure by the applicant's original solicitor to prosecute the appeal with any expedition. The matter was assigned to the applicant's present solicitor by Legal Aid on 28 April 2010. Thereafter the matter has proceeded slowly. However, I am satisfied that the failure to prosecute the appeal in the appropriate manner was not occasioned by any action of the applicant. If I had been persuaded that the applicant had an arguable case on the appeal I would have granted leave to appeal. However, as I discuss below in my view the appeal is without merit and I would refuse leave to appeal out of time.""
28That observation is consistent with an affidavit sworn by the applicant on 18 September 2013 where he said:
""3 Within a few days of being sentenced, I lodged an appeal from the MRRC.  I think I ticked that I wanted to appeal against my conviction only.  I did not know that I could appeal against my sentence at the same time as appealing against my conviction.  I thought I had to choose.  My lawyer told me that if the conviction appeal succeeded, my conviction would be quashed and I would not need to appeal against my sentence.""
29Although the applicant has not been well served by some of his legal advisors, and may have had an incorrect understanding of his appeal rights, that is not the case in relation to the solicitors who, with the assistance of Legal Aid NSW, brought his appeal against conviction.  It would be most surprising if, having filed an application for an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal against conviction, those solicitors had not also considered whether to make a similar application in relation to sentence.  The fact that no such application was made allows an inference that those solicitors did not consider such an application had reasonable prospects of success.
30In December 2012 Legal Aid NSW contacted the applicant and advised him that as a result of a review of his file, based on Muldrock, a further application by him for legal aid was likely to succeed.  It was as a result of that process that this matter is now before the Court.
Delay
31The sentence was imposed on 6 March 2009.  Accordingly, an extension of time of over 4 years is sought for this application for leave to appeal against sentence.
32The competing submissions in relation to delay, finality and the Court's consideration of those submissions are set out in Abdul v R at [31] - [59].  Those submissions and the Court's conclusions in relation thereto are incorporated into this judgment.
33The extent of the delay is substantial and it is only partly explained.   The principle of finality stands against an extension of time.
34In those circumstances, an assessment of whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted is determinative in this matter.  None of the other factors identified in the decided cases and discussed in Abdul v R favour the granting of an extension of time.   
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120
35The substantial issue in this ground is whether material error having been established, this Court should in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, impose a lesser sentence because such a sentence is warranted in law (s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)).
36The applicant submitted that by reference to sentencing statistics, the sentence imposed on the applicant was at the top of the range and that this was not justified by his Honour's assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence, i.e. slightly below the mid-range of seriousness.  The applicant submitted that the use of the standard non-parole period of 7 years as a guidepost only, rather than as a determinative consideration, made it clear on all the facts of this case that a lesser sentence was warranted in law.  No other submissions were put by the applicant in support of this ground.
37The limits of statistics were clearly set out by the High Court in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520.  Specifically the Court said:
""54 ... a history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits.""
38Comments to similar effect were made by McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Price and RA Hulme JJ agreed) in Bourke v R [2010] NSWCCA 22; 199 A Crim R 38:
""44 Although the statistics of the Judicial Commission may provide a useful guide they also make plain that the maximum penalty of 25 years may not have been afforded appropriate significance when sentencing for this offence. It is important to remember that the sentences which have been imposed and reflected in the relevant statistics must be approached with care lest they operate to confine the practical application of the full range of potential sentences provided by the statutory maximum.""
39What the applicant's submission substantially ignores is the maximum penalty for this offence which is imprisonment for 25 years.  In that regard, there is some incongruity in the legislature providing that the standard non-parole period for a ""mid-range offence"" is imprisonment for 7 years when compared with the maximum penalty. This Court commented upon the similar incongruity with offences under s33 Crimes Act 1900 in Duncombe v R [2013] NSWCCA 271 at [49] - [53].
40 In any event, as a result of Muldrock, a sentencing court is not to focus upon the standard non-parole period but is to treat it as a guidepost just like the maximum sentence for the relevant offence.  In accordance with Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357, all other relevant factors also have to be taken into account.
41As well as the matters identified by the sentencing judge there is the important matter of aggravation that this offence was committed only four months after the applicant had been released to parole for three offences of armed robbery.  In addition, the applicant was clearly the principal offender, as he instigated the attack and was involved in all aspects of the offending.  The victim was pursued over a period of time and over a distance while he tried to flee.  The attack was vicious and the applicant has shown no contrition or remorse.  The fact that the applicant appears to have made a reasonable recovery from his injuries does not greatly ameliorate these matters.
42In the circumstances of this case, I am firmly of the opinion that no lesser sentence is warranted in law than that which was imposed by the sentencing judge.  Accordingly, although this ground of appeal has been made out, it does not produce any beneficial consequences for the applicant.
Ground 2:  His Honour's discretion miscarried in his consideration of the commencement date of the sentence.
43As already indicated the applicant was released to parole on 19 October 2006 for three offences of armed robbery.  The present offence was committed approximately three and a half months later on 1 February 2007.  The applicant was arrested for this offence on 6 February 2007.  On 8 February 2007 the applicant's parole was revoked with effect from 7 February 2007.  The balance of his parole expired on 9 November 2008.  The sentencing judge fixed this sentence to commence after the expiration of that period, i.e. 10 November 2008.
44In the course of submissions, it became common ground that the question of whether his Honour should backdate the commencement date of this sentence to a date earlier than 10 November 2008 was raised in the sentence submissions, albeit not particularly clearly (sentencing transcript 27.2.09, pp 4-5).  It was clear that his Honour was well aware that the commencement date fixed by him for the sentence involved it being fully accumulated on the balance of parole for the earlier robbery offences.
45It should be noted that when considering this ground and the remaining grounds of appeal different considerations apply to those which governed the consideration of Ground 1.  In Ground 1 error was acknowledged so that the provisions of s6(3) were activated.  That is not the case here.  Before there can be any consideration of re-sentencing, error on the part of the sentencing judge has to be demonstrated.
46The applicant submitted (correctly) that the sentencing judge had a discretion to backdate the sentence to be concurrent with, or partly concurrent with the balance of parole (R v Kaiva (CCA, unreported, 9 November 1998), R v Kitchener [2003] NSWCCA 134, Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145).  The applicant submitted, however, that at the heart of the discretionary decision on that issue was the notion of double punishment.  The applicant relied upon the observation of Kirby J (with whom Simpson J agreed) in Kaiva:
""Secondly, his Honour expressly took into account, as a circumstance of aggravation, the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on parole.  That was entirely appropriate.  The sentence which he then passed reflected that circumstance.  Having taken that matter into account, to then not backdate the sentence gives the appearance of penalising the prisoner for a second time, in respect of the same matter.  That, it seems to me, is also undesirable.""
The applicant noted that in Kaiva the breach of parole (like here) was referable solely to the commission of the offence for which the offender was being sentenced.
47The applicant submitted that even if it were open to his Honour to date the sentence from the expiration of the balance of parole, the principle of totality required some reduction in the sentence imposed in the circumstances of the case.  He submitted that the effect of the accumulation was to add nearly two years to the effective non-parole period.  He submitted that this was not warranted in the circumstances of this case.
48The applicant's submission should not be accepted.  Where parole is revoked as a consequence of the commission of a subsequent offence, whether the sentence for the subsequent offence should be backdated to the time the offender was taken into custody for the subsequent offence is a matter for the exercise of the sentencing judge's discretion.
49The relevant principles were set out by Simpson J in Callaghan.  There Simpson J (with whom James and Hall JJ agreed) summarised the relevant principles:
""21 That the matter is discretionary appears to be the prevailing view of members of this Court.  Even in Andrews and Kelly, the court accepted that a judge might backdate a sentence where parole had been revoked by reason of the offence for which the offender is then to be sentenced.
22 I maintain the view that a discretion exists.  There is no clear rule which will govern all cases.  The circumstances that bring an offender before a court for sentence after parole has been revoked are far too varied to permit a single absolute rule.
23 It would, in my opinion, in some cases be unfair not to backdate to some point (not necessarily the date of revocation of parole) before the expiration of the earlier parole period.  It is always open to an offender to seek and be granted parole even after a revocation; to sentence in such a way as to commence the subsequent sentence only on the date of expiration of the whole of the previously imposed head sentence is to assume that, absent the subsequent offences, the offender would not have been granted a second chance at parole.
24 However, I am also of the view that, particularly where, as here, the re-offending has occurred within a very short time of release on parole, and the balance of term to which the offender is exposed is quite short, it may be appropriate to proceed on the hypothesis that the whole of the period spent in custody up to the expiration of the parole period is, as Hunt CJ at CL said, referable to the earlier offences and not to the subsequent offences.
25 Thus, I am of the view that the sentencing judge did have a discretion to make the sentences wholly or partly cumulative upon the sentence to which the applicant was, as a consequence of the revocation of parole, serving.  That allowed her a period of six months.  She could have specified the current sentences to commence at any time during that period.""
50Similar statements of principle were provided by Basten JA and RS Hulme J in R v DW [2012] NSWCCA 66 at [35] and [79]; 221 A Crim R 63 as follows:
BASTEN JA:  ""35 Although it was submitted that the commencement date for the sentences for the new offences should not properly have been backdated, the primary submission was that the extent of the backdating, to the commencement of custody relating to the new offences, was excessive. In circumstances where the offences constitute the reason for the revocation of parole, it is important not to double count the fact that the offences were committed whilst serving an incomplete sentence for an earlier offence, and whilst on parole for that offence. It is also necessary to consider whether there should be a degree of concurrency, to allow for the possibility that the respondent could have been re-paroled during the course of the balance of term on the earlier offence: Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; 160 A Crim R 145 at [21]-[23] (Simpson J, James and Hall JJ agreeing).  A further factor to be taken into account on the appeal is that the prosecutor's submissions on sentence accepted the backdating to the commencement of the new period of custody. That factor is not conclusive against intervention, but is a consideration which may persuade the Court not to intervene in the exercise of its residual discretion.""
RS HULME J:  ""79 There is no doubt that the decision as to when, within a period of revoked parole, another sentence should commence is a matter of discretion - see Callaghan v R (2006) 160 A Crim R 145. It may be at the beginning; it may be at the end; it may be somewhere in between. A number of matters are liable to inform the exercise of that discretion. Without attempting to be exhaustive, one is the fact that imprisonment for the period of revoked parole is, in its origins, due to the sentence pursuant to which the period when the offender was eligible for parole was granted.  Revocation may have occurred because it has been demonstrated that an offender has been unable to adapt to normal community life.  A second, although there will commonly be overlap with the first, may be as in this case, that the revocation arises in consequence of a new offence for which a fresh sentence is being imposed, rather than for some unconnected cause.  A third and fourth are likely to be the period served with apparent adherence to the terms of parole and the periods of revocation and for which the revocation is liable to continue.""
51In this case the new offending took place approximately three and a half months after the commencement of parole for the earlier offences.  That does not assist the applicant.  Similarly, the applicant had spent only a short time subject to parole conditions.  The only consideration in his favour is that the balance of the parole period was substantial, i.e. 1 year and 7 months. 
52As the authorities make clear, the commencement date of the sentence was a matter of discretion for the sentencing judge.  The commission of such a serious offence shortly after the commencement of parole for three other significant offences shows considerable contempt for the justice system.  As such it is properly taken into account as a matter of aggravation.  Another significant feature is the similarity between the offences for which parole was being served and the offence presently under consideration.  In the circumstances of this case, I do not regard the commencement date of this sentence as constituting some form of double counting.  On the contrary, to have further backdated the commencement date of the sentence would have offended the principle of totality and would not have provided adequate punishment and denunciation of the present offence.
53It follows that I am not persuaded that his Honour erred in the exercise of his discretion in fixing a commencement date for this sentence.  
Ground 3:  His Honour erred by finding that parity was not in issue.
Ground 4:  The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance when considering the sentence imposed on the co-accused Dharma.
54The applicant submitted that the fact that Dharma had pleaded guilty to a different offence did not necessarily render parity irrelevant, nor did the fact that s97 did not attract a standard non-parole period.  The applicant relied upon Green v The Queen; Quinn v The Queen [2011] HCA 49;  244 CLR 462 where French CJ, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ said:
""30 ... The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted.  So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""
55The applicant submitted that the starting point for the sentence on Dharma before the 15 percent discount for the plea was 5 years imprisonment.  While the applicant accepted that it was clearly appropriate that Dharma receive a lesser sentence than him he submitted that the discrepancy between the two sentences was marked and was not justified.
56The applicant's submission should not be accepted.  The differences between the offending by the applicant and that of Dharma were substantial and justified the difference in sentences.  The trial judge was quite correct to conclude that the parity principle did not apply.  
57The applicant was charged with a more serious offence which had a longer maximum sentence and a standard non-parole period, i.e. different guideposts to those affecting the sentence imposed on Dharma.  The role played by each in the offending was significantly different.  Dharma's offending occurred towards the end of the sequence of events.  The applicant participated in both attacks on the victim and it was he who inflicted the grievous bodily harm.  This gives rise to a significant difference in moral culpability between the offenders.
58The evidence in the applicant's trial was that he was the principal participant in the second attack on the victim and it was he who removed the money from the victim's pockets.  It was the applicant who kicked the victim in the right side of his face.  The applicant's role was far greater than that of Dharma because he was involved in the first attack which included threatening the victim with a knife.
59Their subjective features also differed.  The applicant was found to have shown no remorse, whereas the co-offender demonstrated some limited remorse.  There was a significant difference in their criminal histories.  Dharma had committed an armed robbery in 1995 whereas the applicant had been convicted of three armed robberies in 2005 for which he was still on parole at the time of this offence.
60The differences in the offending between the applicant and Dharma and in their subjective cases was such that any sense of grievance felt by the applicant could not be ""justified"" in the sense set out by Dawson and  Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301.
61The observation by Basten JA in R v Chandler; Chandler v R [2012] NSWCCA 135 bears upon the applicant's submissions in relation to this ground:
""6 A second fallacy apparent from the submissions in this case is that because both the applicant and his co-offender were involved in the same conduct, parity required that they receive broadly similar sentences. Courts act upon findings of fact as agreed by the parties or made by the Court. There are often discrepancies between the facts upon which each offender is sentenced. That was so in the present case. The applicant complained that a much more serious view should be taken of his co-offender's role than that taken by English DCJ, who sentenced the co-offender. That submission may be accepted, but it does not assist the applicant.  First, had English DCJ taken a more serious view of the co-offender's conduct, she would no doubt have imposed a greater sentence and the resultant disparity would have been reduced.  Secondly, the evidence before English DCJ was indeed quite different from that tendered on the applicant's sentencing.""
62No error has been demonstrated in his Honour's treatment of parity.  These grounds of appeal have not been made out.
Conclusion
63It follows that to grant an extension of time for the application for leave to appeal against sentence would be futile.  The grounds of appeal do not have sufficient prospects of success to justify the considerable extension of time which the applicant seeks.
64The order which I propose is that the application for extension of time be dismissed.
65JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
66BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2705828,Prince v R [2013] NSWCCA 274,"Judgment

1GLEESON JA: I agree with Schmidt J. 

2McCALLUM J: I have read in draft the judgment of Schmidt J. I agree that ground 1 should be rejected, for the reasons her Honour has stated. As to ground 2, I agree with her Honour's conclusion that the jury's verdict cannot be impugned to the extent that it may have rested on joint criminal enterprise. I would respectfully not join in her Honour's conclusion that the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt as to the primary Crown case, that it was the appellant who wielded the weapon that wounded Mr Waters. On the strength of my consideration of the whole of the record of the trial, I consider that it was well open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty on that direct basis. In my respectful opinion, this is a case in which any measure of doubt emerging from a review of the transcript is quintessentially of the kind capable of being resolved by the inestimable advantage enjoyed by the jury in seeing the manner in which the answers were given, absorbing the many subtle cues a transcript does not record and debating those matters amongst themselves in the jury room. In my assessment, the weaknesses in the evidence relied upon by the appellant in support of this ground are of the kind in respect of which those advantages cannot be supplanted by a sober consideration of the words said, as recorded in a transcript. My conclusion on that issue is fortified by the fact that no such doubt was excited in the mind of the judge who presided over the trial and heard the same evidence. His Honour's reasons for being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who struck the victim substantially reflect my own reasons for reaching the same conclusion, based on all of the evidence. 

3Since mine is a minority view, it is not necessary to consider the appeal against sentence except on the premise accepted by the majority, namely, that the Crown failed to establish that it was the appellant who wielded the weapon that wounded Mr Waters. On that premise, I agree with Schmidt J as to the appeal against sentence, for the reasons her Honour has stated. I agree with the orders proposed by Schmidt J.

4SCHMIDT J: On 10 February 2012 a jury convicted the appellant of two offences, the first of affray (s 93C of the Crimes Act 1900) and the second of wounding Bernard Waters with intent to cause him grievous bodily harm (s 33(1)(a)). The offences were committed on the evening of 20 June 2010 in Tamworth. The appellant does not appeal his conviction of the affray. He does appeal his conviction of the s 33 offence and also seeks leave to appeal the sentence King DCJ imposed upon him for both offences.

5After a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the sentence King DCJ imposed for the s 93C offence was a fixed term of 18 months imprisonment commencing on 8 February 2012 and expiring on 7 August 2013. For the s 33 offence his Honour imposed a non-parole period of 4 years commencing 8 August 2012 and expiring on 7 August 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years commencing 8 August 2016 and expiring 7 August 2018.

6The maximum penalty for the s 33 offence was 25 years imprisonment. A standard non-parole period of 7 years applied to that offence under s 54A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The maximum penalty for the s 93C offence was 10 years.

7The appellant did not give evidence either at trial or on sentencing. That there had been a violent affray outside the home of one of the witnesses, Ms Jessica Hawke, on the evening of 20 June was not in contest, but the appellant's role was. 

8Various witnesses not only identified the appellant as having been involved in the affray, but also as the person who had wielded the weapon with which Mr Waters was struck on the head. It was the reliability of that identification which was in issue. 

Grounds

9The grounds of the conviction appeal in relation to the s 33 offence are:

""Ground 1

The trial erred in his directions to the jury regarding the alternative charge of reckless wounding in company.[sic]

Ground 2

The verdict in relation to the charge of wound with intent to cause GBH charge was unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence.[sic]""


10The conviction appeal is governed by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides that the Court of Criminal Appeal ""shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence"". 

11This provision was considered in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 76 A Crim R 213, where Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ observed at 216:

""Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sustain a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question which the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty"".



12In Libke v R [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 it was explained at [113] that the phrase 'open to the jury' meant 'whether it was open to the jury to be satisfied of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, which is to say whether the jury must, as distinct from might, have entertained a doubt about the appellant's guilt.'

13In SKA v The Queen [2011] HCA 13; (2011) 243 CLR 400 the majority explained:

13 The starting point in the application of s 6(1) is that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilt or innocence, and the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. However, the joint judgment in M went on to say:

""In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred.""



14The ground of the sentence appeal is:

""Ground 3

Should all the grounds against conviction be unsuccessful, the Appellant will on the date of the hearing apply for leave to appeal against severity of sentence on the ground that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and/or that it was not open to the trial judge to sentence the appellant on the basis that he inflicted the wounds the subject Count 1 [sic]""


15The Crown's case was that even if it was concluded that it was not open to the trial judge to sentence the appellant on the basis that he inflicted the wound which Mr Waters suffered, the sentence would not be disturbed, because the Court would not be satisfied that any lesser sentence was warranted in law (see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79]). 


The Crown concedes an error in sentencing

16While not raised on the sentencing appeal, at the hearing the Crown raised an error which it had identified. It appears that the appellant had been granted bail, which was revoked when his bail was breached, after he became involved in a family dispute in which he was involved in an altercation with one of his daughters, over answering a subpoena which required her to give evidence at the trial. He became intoxicated and had to be treated in hospital, after putting his fist through a window. The hearing also had to be delayed, until he was sufficiently sober to give instructions.

17He was held in custody, bail refused, for a period of some two weeks prior to being sentenced. This was not drawn to his Honour's attention on sentencing. It was properly accepted that if it had been, his Honour would have taken the period so spent in custody into account when fixing the date of commencement of the sentence imposed on the appellant. 

18In the result it was accepted that this error meant that the appellant should be re-sentenced by this Court. Otherwise the Crown's position was that the appeal would be refused and the sentence imposed not further disturbed.

The evidence

19At trial the parties agreed that during the affray Mr Waters had suffered a 10cm full thickness laceration to his scalp which required suturing and that he also sustained bruising to his right back, right chest and left knee. It was also agreed that the laceration constituted a wound at law. 

20Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson had been at Ms Hawke's house on 19 June, the day before the affray. She lived there with her son and two friends. The house was located on the corner of Sussex and Bourne streets, opposite a park. It had a yard which was fenced by a colorbond fence, which on Ms Hawke's evidence was not damaged before the affray.

21Mr Sampson's evidence was that on 19 June they were in the front yard of the house when the appellant drove past in a car with a number of other people, including his sister Fiona Prince and his nephew Michael Prince and some children. He called out to Mr Peterson 'Go and get your uncles, your fathers, or whatever for me, I'll fight them and all that if youse want to carry on'. Mr Peterson, who knew the appellant because he had gone out with one of his daughters for a few weeks, 'bit back'. Mr Sampson also knew the appellant, because his aunt used to go out with his brother. The next day they saw the appellant in the park across the road from Ms Hawke's house arguing with a girl, who he thought was the appellant's daughter. Mr Sampson's evidence was that Mr Peterson began mouthing off at him, being cheeky. The appellant walked away.

22Mr Peterson had been in rehabilitation in the time since the affray and did not have a clear memory of that night, but corroborated aspects of both Mr Waters' and Mr Sampson's evidence. He did remember that he had gone out with the appellant's daughter for a few weeks and that his argument with the appellant was about their nephews 'rowing' and fighting. Initially he denied saying anything to the appellant, but later said that he said something that 'ticked me off' and that he then yelled 'well I'll meet you in the middle, you want me to meet you in the middle'. He also said that later, while he was kicking back at Ms Hawke's house, that there was yelling and that on 20 June he went to meet up with the appellant in the park to 'have a go', but that it 'didn't work out the way it was meant to'.

23That evening Mr Waters, Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson were present with a number of others at a gathering in the yard of Ms Hawke's house, where a fire was burning. Inside the house were Ms Hawke and her friends Jamie-Lee Hawkins, Nyari Jackomos and Bianca Kedwell. They were watching movies and not drinking.

24Mr Waters and others who were involved in, or present during the affray described what they saw that night. Various of the witnesses gave an account of having seen people, including the appellant and Mr Peterson, in the park beforehand. That identification was not in issue on appeal. 

25The evidence was that the street lighting was operating normally that night and that there was a very bright spotlight on a pole in the park, which lit it up and shone back to Bourne St. Police attended at about 10.30pm. The attending constables variously described the light in the park as 'quite bright' (Constable Murray), but in the immediate area of Bourne Street, 'poor' (Constable Rachford). Constable Parsons' evidence was that the light was sufficient for her to see the people there. They found the fence damaged, with panels missing and a lot of glass, a chain and a knife on the road, as well as other weapons in the vicinity.

26Ms Hawke's evidence was that an outside backdoor light was on, which lit up the backyard, which was also lit by the fire. Inside kitchen lights were also shining into the yard. The only witness who described it to be dark, was Ms Kedwell. 

27The affray broke out after an altercation between the appellant and Mr Peterson in the park. It was not disputed that Mr Waters' head injury was inflicted during this affray, when he was struck on the head with a weapon variously described by other witnesses as a machete and a sword. That weapon was not found.

28The affray was variously described as having involved two groups of men, who spent a considerable time throwing bricks, bottles and sticks at each other. On Ms Kedwell's evidence, the violence lasted for some 15-20 minutes, during which Mr Waters, who was in the yard, was attacked by the appellant and others with him. He fell to the ground when one of them struck him with the weapon which lacerated his head. The appellant relied on Ms Kedwell's description of the assailant, to support his case that the Crown had not established beyond reasonable doubt that it was he who had inflicted this wound.

29Mr Waters was not able to identify who hit him on the head, although he identified the appellant as part of the group who attacked him, in the statement which he gave to police that night and in his evidence. His evidence was that he went to Ms Hawke's house that evening with his nephew, Mr Dale Sampson. A group of 15 to 20 people were gathered there, including his brother, Mr Ernie Peterson. People were outside drinking near the fire and out the front. His evidence was that before he went to Ms Hawke's house he had drunk two or three cans of rum at lunchtime, but had eaten lunch and his dinner afterwards. Mr Sampson described him to have been a bit tipsy, but that neither he nor Mr Peterson drank. Later Constable Parsons said she could smell alcohol on Mr Waters, but that he was not drunk.

30Mr Waters arrived at between 8 and 9 pm and initially went into the house, before going out to the fire. He knew Ms Hawke. He had been told about the incident between Mr Peterson and the appellant and understood that he had received some threats. He also knew the appellant, who was the brother-in-law of his sister. He was concerned about his brother and wanted to ensure that he did not get involved in a fight with the appellant. Mr Peterson was then aged 19 years and Mr Sampson 17 or 18. Mr Waters was some 15 years older than his brother. In cross-examination he said that he was there to protect his brother and nephew. Mr Sampson's evidence was that Mr Peterson told him while they were in the yard, that the appellant wanted to fight him.

31There were various accounts of how it was that the affray later broke out. Mr Waters' evidence was that he heard a lot of yelling from the park. He moved to the fence and could hear one voice yelling out to his brother. He moved to the gates and saw the appellant in the park trying to call his brother over to fight. He was alone, calling Mr Peterson's name. Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson corroborated that evidence. Mr Waters said that he was urging his brother not to fight the appellant, but he went over to the park.

32The accounts given by the witnesses differed as to whether Mr Waters and Mr Sampson then followed Mr Peterson over to the park; whether Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson were armed with sticks; what caused them to return to Ms Hawke's house; and whether Mr Peterson went into the house and remained there, or was involved in the affray. 

33What was common to these accounts was that Mr Peterson crossed the road and went into the park, where he approached the appellant and they yelled at each other. Mr Peterson was ready to fight the appellant, but fled from the park without any fighting between them. 

34On Mr Waters' account he followed Mr Peterson, with Mr Sampson urging him to fight and Mr Waters urging him not to. They were about five metres apart and he finally pulled him away, when he saw the appellant bring something from behind his back, which he described to be shiny, which he saw glinting. He could not see what it was, but said that he was frantic, fearing that it was a weapon and told them to get out, he did not want them dead. He grabbed them by the back of their shirts and dragged them back and they went back to Ms Hawke's house, where Mr Peterson went inside and he went into the yard. 

35Mr Waters was cross-examined by the Crown as to earlier evidence he had given, in which he had said that the appellant had pulled out what looked like a knife or machete out of his sleeve. His evidence was that he only caught a quick glimpse of this object, before he pulled his brother and nephew out of the park. In cross-examination for the appellant he agreed that he had not mentioned this object when he made his statement to police, while in the hospital. He explained that he was then only asked about who had hit him. He had not then seen a machete, only a little metal pole, or shiny thing. He agreed that he was not sure that it was a knife or machete, but insisted that he had seen a shiny object.

36Mr Waters said that Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson were in and out of the yard a couple of times, checking the park, while he was in the yard talking. About five or ten minutes later there was more abuse yelled from the park. He then heard more voices and when he went and looked over to the park, he saw a group of men, with the appellant in the centre, carrying weapons which looked like sticks, a bar and a machete, but he could not see what the appellant was carrying in his hand. Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson were no longer armed. The two groups were exchanging abuse and he tried to get everyone back into the yard and shut the gates, while there were missiles being thrown at him. He said in cross-examination that Mr Peterson was then near the back steps and Mr Sampson behind one of the cars in the yard. He was in the driveway.

37Mr Sampson's evidence was that Mr Peterson went to the park. In cross-examination he said that he was alone and unarmed and that he had not seen Mr Waters go into the park, he remained with him and a Mr Allan. He also said that he saw Mr Peterson flee the park, after the appellant pulled 'a machete or something' out, when they were about '30 metres apart' and starting running towards him. About 30 others who were all armed with 'sticks and stuff' joined him. In cross-examination he said they might have been 50 metres apart and the group which emerged another 20 metres behind him.

38Mr Sampson's evidence was that Mr Peterson ran into the house and told him to help Mr Waters. Mr Peterson agreed that he went inside, but accounts as to how long he remained there differed. On Mr Peterson's own evidence, however, he was also involved in the affray, returning outside and throwing bottles at the group attacking Mr Waters. Mr Sampson's evidence was that he had also gone to go inside, but became involved when he saw Mr Waters was being attacked. He was then throwing bricks he said, in order, to protect himself. In cross-examination he denied being inside the house during the affray. Mr Peterson had locked the door on him, when he went inside. Mr Peterson's evidence was that Ms Kedwell was also involved in the fighting at one point. She denied this.

39Mr Peterson remembered the appellant yelling his name and that he 'jumped straight at it' and 'that's when me and him was meant to meet in the middle of the park and have a go' and that he went there 'peacefully to get it over and done with'. He said that he took nothing with him and that Mr Waters and Mr Sampson did not go with him, but waited near the gate. He saw the appellant swinging something around in his hand and saw other 'young fellas' come to join him from behind the bike jumps and that he turned and ran as soon as he saw their heads popping up. He did not know what the appellant was holding, but he could 'see the shine'. He said that when he got to the back door, they were already in the yard. That did not accord with the evidence of other witnesses. 

40In cross-examination Mr Peterson denied that he had hit the appellant in the stomach with a brick, while they were in the park together. He claimed that he was then concerned to look after Mr Sampson and not cause dramas. 

41Ms Kedwell's evidence was that she also heard the yelling before the affray broke out. She saw the group in the park increase from three to four people to 10 to 15. Her evidence was that the group from the house were yelling out 'Reapers for life. Mother' and the group across the road yelling 'QSBs bitches'. She also saw rocks, bricks and sticks being thrown by both sides and the group in the park cross the road. She then saw three or four of them run up to Mr Waters, who was hit over the head with what she described to be a big green coloured samurai style sword, when three or four people ran up to him. He fell to the ground behind a car, about two to three feet from the fire, with blood pouring out of his head. She could not see him on the ground, but could hear what sounded like the men continuing to beat him. They ran away a few minutes later. 

42Ms Kedwell said it was dark and that she could not see people's faces, but described the person who struck Mr Waters in terms which did not describe the appellant. The appellant is of Aboriginal descent, a middle-aged man of average stature. Her description of what she saw was:

""Q. How many do you say ran up Koey?
A. There was about three or four of them. It was that dark but I know there was at least three of them and one of them hit him over the head with a sword looking thing.
Q. Can you describe the sword looking thing?
A. Well, it was really long, or fairly long. It was sort of - well, what I could see in the dark anyway it was sort of like a greeny colour. Could have been dark or could have been lighter but what it looked like to me was like a greeny looking colour.
Q. How long was this thing?
A. It was fairly long, I wouldn't be able to tell you exact inches or length but it looked like sort of one of them mantel swords, if you know what I mean. Like, you put on a mantel or something like that, one of them-
Q. Decorative?
A. Yeah, just display Samurai looking - or I don't know, one of them sort of looking things, so - to me it did anyway.

...

Q. The person you say who had the sword, who struck Koey, are you able to say what that person was wearing?
A. It was really dark and - see, I can't really remember anything. Like, if you were to ask me when it first started, I probably would have been able to but now I can't really remember anything.
Q. You remember giving evidence in this courtroom in July of last year?
A. Vaguely. I do but -1 remember coming but I don't remember what I said,
so-
Q. Right, okay?
A. They gave me a transcript, I think they called it. I think that's what they called it anyway.

Q. I'm going to read from that transcript. Okay?
A. Yep.
WALSH: Your Honour and Mr Crown, p 216.40.
Q. This question was put to you?
A. Mmm.
Q. By the crown prosecutor?
A. Mmm
Q.
""Q. The person that swung the sword, are you able to describe the person like -
A. He was young. That's about it. He wasn't very old or I don't think so.
Q. How tall?
A. I don't know. Sort of average I suppose. I couldn't tell you.
Q. What gave you the impression that he was young?
A. Just because of the way he - he wasn't very big. Like, he wasn't like, you know, like man sort of size. He was sort of a young guy.
Q. He was just a smaller person?
A. Yeah.
Q. But you didn't see his face?
A. No. He was just small framed.
Q. The other boys or men around Koey, did they have any weapons or anything in their hands?
A. No. There were just one of them that did.""

That's the evidence you gave in July last year?
A. Yep.
Q. On that occasion you told the truth to the best of your ability?
A. Yeah.

Q. Is that correct? And you agree today that would be your evidence today?
A. Yep.
Q. You talked about some of the people on our side?
A. Mmm.
Q. Ernie, Dale, Frank and Thomas?
A. Mmm.
Q. Begin outside - at some stage outside the yard just outside the fence. Is
that right? They were yelling across the road?
A. Yes, that is correct.
Q. Did you ever see Koey go outside the yard at any stage that night?
A. Not that I can remember, no.
Q. And you said in your evidence today that it was very dark in the yard. Is
that right?
A. Yes, it was.

Q. And I take it that's why you can't say too much about what you saw
because it was so dark. Is that right?
A. That's correct.
Q. And you weren't able to see people's faces and - is that correct?
A. That's correct.
Q. So you could see people but not the detail of-
A. Yeah, but not the detail.""



43Mr Waters' evidence in chief was that he was in the driveway trying to shut the gates, but things were frantic. He was later told that his brother had then gone into the house. Rocks, bottles and sticks were being thrown and then someone shouted a warning to him, he turned around and was attacked. 

44Mr Waters said that he then saw the appellant, but he was not the first one who ran into the yard. He was first hit in the ribs with a whipper snipper handle, being wielded by someone other than the appellant, who he identified. He retaliated by punching that person, who fell to his knees and the others then set him upon. He kept fighting, being hit everywhere. He felt two hits on the head and felt his ears pop. He pulled the man on his knees over and rolled onto the ground, using him as a shield, while he continued being hit with sticks, iron bars and what felt like blunt objects. He then thought someone was trying to kill him and eventually let the man he was holding go and managed to stand up, ready to fight on, but his attackers fled, chased by those in the yard, who were still throwing things at them. 

45Mr Waters did not know what he was struck with on the head and could not identify the person who struck him, or those with him, apart from the person who hit him with the whipper snipper. In cross-examination he said that he did not actually see the appellant in the yard and agreed that he had never said that it was the appellant who struck him on the head.

46He was treated in hospital for his head wound, lacerations and bruising. He made a statement to the police while there. The head wound required nine stiches. 

47Ms Hawkins' evidence was that she was at Ms Hawke's house during the day with Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson and had heard people going past on a number of occasions, yelling at Mr Peterson. She had also heard Mr Peterson respond. She returned to the house at about 8pm and was told to park her car in the yard, because the 'boys in Quinn Street' were 'starting stuff'. She was outside later and saw Mr Peterson, Mr Sampson, Mr Waters and others standing near the gate, while people were yelling from the park. She heard Mr Peterson respond at one point, but did not listen to what he said. She could see the outlines of four or five people's shadows in the park, moving around. She thought at one stage some boys had crossed from the house to the park and returned, but she could not remember who they were.

48Ms Hawkins then saw four people in the park walk towards the house. She saw another four or five come out and then a larger group, who she described as 'the boys from Quinn St', start running toward the house. When they got close she was told to go inside the house. All the girls did, apart from Ms Kedwell. When she was up on the steps she could see that one of them was carrying a metre-long object in his right hand, held beside his body towards the ground. It was shining in the light, while the others were carrying a wood plank or a stick and bricks and rocks.

49From inside the open door Ms Hawkins saw four or five men from the park rush towards Mr Waters, who she saw fall. She did not see him hit the ground, because a car obscured him and she was then pushed inside the house. She also saw the man carrying the shiny object at the gate, walking fast toward Mr Waters, before he fell. She also said that Mr Peterson had been inside the house, but she thought that he was then standing near the steps. He did not come back inside again, until shortly before Mr Waters did. It was she and another girl who called the police.

50In cross-examination Ms Hawkins said that Mr Peterson had been inside the house for only about a minute and that he was standing near the bottom of the steps when Mr Waters was being attacked, although she agreed that she was not sure when he was inside. She also agreed that in other evidence she had given, she had said that he was inside when five people attacked Mr Waters. Her memory was not clear, but she did remember that the person with the shiny object was wearing a blue jumper. In re-examination she said that she could only remember bits and pieces of that night, but that she was sure that he was wearing a candy blue jumper. 

51She also said that Mr Waters had asked her to look at his head. She could see his skull and got him a towel. She did not know the people who had attacked, she did not see their faces, but was later told that it was the Princes.

52Ms Hawke had also heard the yelling outside. She did not really remember who was yelling, but said that Mr Peterson had started a lot of trouble for her on earlier occasions. She did not know all the people who were at her house that evening. She said that she had no control over who had come there. She was inside with her friends watching moves.

53She remembered the yelling starting outside with Mr Peterson. She went outside at the back door to see what was going on. She saw Mr Peterson, Mr Sampson, Mr Waters and two others standing near the gates yelling abuse at a group of four or five men in the middle of the park, who were also yelling abuse. She had not then known that Mr Waters was there.

54Ms Hawke remembered that things were then thrown by both sides, such as rocks, bottles and bricks. The boys in the park came closer, over to the road and the others retreated and then things escalated. 

55Parts of her fence were pushed in and Ms Hawke saw one person run across and strike Mr Waters, who was still standing outside the fence, once on the top of the head with a machete which he was holding. She identified that person to be the appellant, who she said 'was named and pointed out to me'. She did not then know him, but that was what everyone was then saying and what it looked like to her, having a few months earlier had him pointed out to her in the street. She said that others came with him, but she could not remember what they were carrying. 

56She also said that when Mr Waters fell to the ground, the attack did not stop, but they started laying into him. He was not armed, but was surrounded by the appellant and others who were hitting him as well, she assumed with their fists. In cross-examination she recognised one of them to be Steven Prince, who she agreed was of small build, aged about 17 or 18 years. She could not remember what the appellant was wearing.

57In cross-examination Ms Hawke said that she realised the appellant was holding a machete when he came closer. Initially when he was in the middle of the park she was not sure what it was. She thought it was a pole, but when he got closer she saw it had a blade at one end. He was standing under a light at one point as he crossed the park. It looked green in colour and was about a metre long. She said that Mr Waters was then outside the fence about seven and a half metres away and Mr Peterson was inside the yard. She was the only witness who placed them there. Others said Mr Waters was in the yard, near the fire when attacked and Mr Petersen near the steps. In cross-examination she agreed that her memory of the evening was no longer good and that the lighting where Mr Waters was, was not very good. She also agreed that afterwards, there had been a lot of talk about the incident, in which the appellant's name had been mentioned. 

58Ms Hawke went inside and called an ambulance and the police. She later gave Mr Waters some towels. She later participated in computer generated photographic identification when she identified the appellant as the person who had hit Mr Waters with the machete. She considered that he had a recognisable face. 

59In cross-examination her evidence was, however, that she had not paid much attention when the appellant had been pointed out to her in the street, he was then walking away on the other side of the street. She said she had just had a look and looked away. She also said that her memory of the night was not good and that she was relying on her statement. She also agreed that she had given evidence in other proceedings, that she had chosen the appellant's photo because of his distinctive almond eye shape. She agreed that she could have been wrong that it was the appellant holding the machete, because she wouldn't have been able to see the shape of his eyes that night and only had a brief moment to observe what had happened. 

60Ms Hawke said at one point that the appellant had been pointed out to her that night. When pressed, she could not remember whether he had been pointed out to her that night and said that she had to go off her statement. She also agreed that she had earlier given evidence that he had not been pointed out to her and added that she could be wrong that it was him who hit Mr Waters with the machete, but that she was pretty sure that it was. 

61In re-examination, she said that she had identified him because he had been pointed out to her before and she recognised his face, when he came into the light in the park.

62Mr Sampson's evidence was that he was in the yard, near a car, protecting himself by throwing bricks which were near the side of the house, when he saw the appellant run through the gate. Others were then bashing into the fence. He saw the appellant pause and the others with him run towards Mr Waters. He then saw the appellant strike Mr Waters on the top of the head with a machete, causing him to drop to the ground. He described the machete to be silver, about 60cm long and that it caused a big slice on the top of Mr Waters' head, from which blood poured. The appellant then ran off and others, whom he did not recognise, hit Mr Waters with sticks and poles around his ribs and back. In cross-examination he insisted that he saw the appellant attack Mr Waters with a machete and said that he was wearing a white top.

63Mr Sampson said that Mr Waters was unarmed and defended himself by grabbing one of his attackers and using him like a shield. He was then about ten metres away and could not help him, as he was defending himself by throwing bricks and then five or six men chased him into the house, where he remained for a minute or two, before he went back outside, when the attackers ran off. He identified various of the others involved in the affray, including Michael and Stephen Prince, whom he knew

64In cross-examination he said that he did not see a whipper snipper being used. He was on the other side of the car to Mr Waters, but said it was not difficult to see what was happening. He denied seeing the appellant banging at the backdoor. 

65Mr Sampson also denied that he was part of a gang called 'the Reapers', but agreed that Mr Peterson was and that he hung around with them and that he knew that there was a dispute between them and the Prince boys. He also said that Fiona Prince was at the house that night and that earlier in the afternoon, he had seen the appellant and others drinking, a street away.

66Mr Peterson said that he saw his brother fighting one-on-one and one person hitting him with a stick and 'the lad on the other side' also hitting him. He saw him fall and another 'old cuz' fall on top of him and the appellant standing over him, 'trying to crack him', while this man was on top of him. He did not know if the appellant did 'crack' him, but he saw that he was carrying a 'metal sort of piece thing', which could have been even a piece for the bottom of the door which blocks the air, about three quarters of a metre long. 

67Mr Peterson did not recall going into the house, but said that he was at the back door, trying to launch things to get the attackers away from his brother. He was about eight metres away, being attacked near the fire, with one lad trying to hit him with a fence paling in the ribs and the appellant on one side and his nephew on the other.

68In cross-examination Mr Peterson denied remaining in the house, because he was worried about the appellant getting him. He said he was worried about getting whacked and launched bottles from the steps, to try to get the attackers away from his brother, because he 'wasn't gonna run down and get myself slaughtered'. He insisted that he saw his brother fall, with the appellant on one side of him and one of his nephews, Michael, who he described to have fair skin, on the other. He said that he did not know if he actually saw the appellant hit Mr Waters on the head, but he saw him swinging at him, while he was on the ground.

69Evidence was called from police officers who attended the scene, where they found Mr Waters sitting in the gutter, seriously injured. They conducted a search and recovered various weapons in the vicinity, including knives, a hammer and a whipper snipper shaft, which had blood on it. DNA analysis yielded no results. 

70It should also be noted that King DCJ gave the jury a warning as to the reliability of the evidence given by Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson, given their obvious involvement in the affray. This has to be taken into account, when assessing their evidence.

Ground 1 - error in the directions given in relation to the alternative charge of reckless wounding in company

71In my view this ground of appeal was not established.

72The s 33 charge was left to the jury on two alternative bases. Firstly, on the basis of direct liability, that is, that it was the appellant who inflicted the wound to Mr Waters' head. In the alternative, that he was guilty of the offence by reason of his participation in a joint criminal enterprise to wound Mr Waters with the intention of causing him grievous bodily harm and that the wound was caused by a party to that enterprise. The appellant made no complaint as to the charge so advanced, or to the directions given to the jury as to that charge. 

73This ground of the appeal rested instead on the directions given in relation to the statutory alternative to the s 33 charge, of reckless wounding in company, which arose under s 35(3) of the Crimes Act. It was also put on the alternative basis, that the appellant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise. 

74The appellant accepted that s35 charge was properly put to the jury and that there was no error in the directions given as to recklessness. 

75The appellant's case was that his Honour had erred in relation to the directions given in relation to mens rea for that offence, when put on the alternative joint criminal enterprise basis. In that regard his Honour directed that:

""Not only must the person inflicting the wound have been reckless, but the accused, Ian Scott Prince must have intended that that person would inflict the wound recklessly.""


76There was no objection at trial to this direction by either the appellant or the Crown. In the result, the jury was directed not only that the Crown had to prove that the actual offender who wounded Mr Waters did so recklessly, but also that the appellant must have intended that the actual offender would inflict the wound recklessly. The Crown accepted that this direction was wrong. It overstated the mens rea which it was required to prove against the appellant for the alternative charge. 

77As the Crown submitted, what it had to prove in that regard was firstly that Mr Waters' wound was inflicted recklessly by one of the appellant's co-offenders. Further, that the appellant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise, that is, an agreement to attack Mr Waters; that he was acting in company with his co-offenders who he knew were armed with weapons, capable of inflicting a wound when used to strike Mr Waters; that he realised that Mr Waters might be wounded, as a result of the actions taken by one of the other persons with whom he was in company during their attack; and that despite this, in furtherance of that enterprise, he continued to participate. 

78In the circumstances, however, as the Crown submitted, his Honour's error had no impact on the appellant. This was because his Honour properly directed the jury that they could only turn to consider the statutory alternative offence, if they acquitted him of the more serious s 33 offence. There is no reason to think that the jury did not adhere to that direction. The jury convicted Mr Waters of the s 33 offence and thus had no occasion to consider the statutory alternative. 

79In any event, given the nature of his Honour's erroneous direction, even if the jury had considered the s 35 offence before deciding that the appellant was guilty of the s 33 offence, contrary to the direction his Honour had given in that regard, the error would have been one which favoured the appellant. 

80In the result, no miscarriage of justice could have flowed from the misdirection. As the Crown submitted, in the circumstances, the appellant's failure to seek a redirection at the trial in relation to this misdirection, may well have been the result of a proper forensic decision then made. 

81This ground of appeal should thus be dismissed.

Ground 2 - the verdict in relation to the s33 charge was unreasonable and incapable of being supported by the evidence.

82In my view this ground was also not established.

83The appellant's case was that it was implicit in the Crown's decision to put the s33 in the alternative, that it could not prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was he who had inflicted the injuries which Mr Waters sustained.

84This submission must be rejected.

85The Crown advanced its case on the two alternative bases earlier mentioned. Reliance on such an alternative is commonplace. It involves no concession of the kind asserted on the part of the Crown. The jury was properly directed that it was open to them to bring a unanimous verdict of guilty, even if only some of them were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had inflicted the wound and others were satisfied only that he was a member of the joint criminal enterprise. There was no complaint made about that direction. Nor could there have been.

86The appellant's case was that the evidence did not permit a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt that he shared an intention with those with whom he was involved in that enterprise, to inflict really serious harm on Mr Waters. It was submitted that the only evidence of such an intention was:
1. The threat made to Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson a few days earlier, to 'bash your fathers'.

2. The evidence that the appellant had something shiny in his hand in the park.

3. The various witnesses who saw a number of people in the appellant's group carrying weapons.

4. The evidence that the appellant was in the yard with a number of people at the time that the wound was inflicted.

87The test to be applied is that discussed in SKA v R at [14]:

""In determining an appeal pursuant to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act, by applying the test set down in M and restated in MFA, the Court is to make ""an independent assessment of the evidence, both as to its sufficiency and its quality"". [Morris v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 454 at 473 per Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ.] In M, Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ stated: [M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493 (footnotes omitted).] 

""In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s 6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, 'none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand'.""


88Having myself undertaken that assessment of the evidence, in my view the evidence that the appellant was a member of this joint criminal enterprise, being one of those men who were armed with various weapons and implements and who acted together during the affray to attack Mr Waters, with the intention of inflicting really serious harm upon him, was overwhelming.

89The evidence identified by the appellant overlooked other relevant evidence, including the evidence that the appellant was in the group that attacked Mr Waters, who the witnesses described as all being armed with various weapons and implements, including what was variously described as a machete or a sword, as well as a lengthy piece of metal, a whipper snipper handle and sticks; the nature of that attack; and the injuries inflicted on Mr Waters during the attack. He was struck on the head with one weapon and was struck elsewhere with other implements, even after he fell to the ground, where he used one of his attackers as a shield, while the attack continued. On all of that evidence, I am satisfied that the evidence established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant shared an intention with the others who attacked Mr Waters, to inflict really serious harm upon him. 

90There was also evidence given by various witnesses that it was the appellant who had actually hit Mr Waters on the head with the weapon which caused his head wound. The appellant's case was that on this evidence it was not open to the jury to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that it was he who was the person who had used the machete to strike Mr Waters on the head. That, it seems to me, must be accepted. 

91I have been left with a doubt that the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who hit Mr Waters on the head with the weapon which caused his head wound. In my view that is a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is not one which the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence was capable of resolving.

92The matters relied on by the appellant to establish that it was not open to the jury to be satisfied that it was he who used the machete to hit Mr Waters were:

1. The evidence of poor lighting given by Constables Murray and Rachford and Ms Kedwell.

2. Ms Kedwell's description of the person who struck Mr Waters.

3. Ms Hawkins' descriptions of the person carrying the machete to be wearing a blue jumper and Mr Sampson's evidence that he was sure that the appellant was wearing a white top. 

4. Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson's denial that Mr Waters went into the park, despite Mr Waters' evidence that he did. 

5. Mr Waters' evidence that Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson were carrying weapons, despite their denials. 

6. Ms Hawke's concession that she could be wrong in her identification of the appellant. 

7. The general unreliability of the evidence given by Mr Waters, Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson; their antipathy towards and bias against the appellant; and the fact that Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson were potentially criminally concerned in the incident.

93The Crown argued that it was open to the jury to accept the evidence of Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson, corroborated as it was by Ms Hawke's evidence, to conclude that it was the appellant who inflicted the wound to Mr Waters head and that the evidence to the contrary was not such that it ought to have created a reasonable doubt as to him being the assailant.

94While I hold a doubt that it was proven beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who struck Mr Waters on the head with the weapon which caused his head wound during that affray, I do not have such a doubt as to his involvement in the joint criminal enterprise on which the Crown's alternative case rested.

95The conflicts in the evidence which Mr Waters, Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson gave about what had occurred beforehand in the park, does not cast doubt on the appellant's identification as one of the group who later attacked Mr Waters. What was common to their evidence and was corroborated by other witnesses, was that the appellant was initially in the park; that he and Mr Peterson were yelling at each other; that Mr Peterson went over to the park, ready to fight the appellant; and that he fled before any blows were exchanged. Those who followed him included the appellant. They were armed with various weapons, including the weapon with which Mr Waters was struck on the head, as well as sticks, bottles and bricks. An affray ensued in which the appellant was involved.

96I am satisfied that the evidence as to the lighting did not establish that it was so poor that the witnesses who gave evidence that they saw Mr Waters being attacked should be doubted. To the contrary, while there was certainly conflicting evidence as to the lighting, the evidence given by the various witnesses was consistent with there being sufficient light not only for them to see the appellant in the park and running with others from the park towards Mr Waters, but also for them to see his involvement in the attack on Mr Waters, as they described. The evidence given by the police officers who attended later as to the lighting, did not cast real doubt on their evidence as to what they could see.

97While, contrary to the evidence of other witnesses, Ms Kedwell accepted in cross-examination that it was dark in the yard, so that it was hard for her to see the faces of the attackers, the appellant relies on her description of the assailant who struck Mr Waters on the head, as well as that given by Mr Sampson and Ms Hawkins as to what that person was wearing, to submit that it was not proven that the person who struck Mr Waters on the head was him. The force of that submission would be diminished, if the submissions as to the inadequacy of the lighting could be accepted. 

98Ms Kedwell's description of that assailant was clearly not consistent with it being the appellant who wielded the machete. The person she described cannot have been the appellant. While Mr Sampson said that he saw the appellant strike Mr Waters with a machete, his evidence was that he was wearing a white top and Ms Hawkins' evidence was that the person who she saw wield the machete wore a candy blue jumper. This is a conflict which also has to be considered in light of the direction given to the jury as to the caution with which the reliability of the evidence of Mr Sampson and Mr Peterson had to be approached, given that they might be considered to have been criminally concerned in the events which gave rise to the proceedings. No such caution was given in relation to other witnesses, although the appellant also submitted that the evidence of other witnesses, including that of Mr Waters and Ms Hawke, was unreliable. 

99As to Mr Waters, it was not suggested that he was criminally involved, but his Honour drew to the jury's attention the impact which his relationship with Mr Peterson and Mr Sampson might have had on his evidence.

100For her part Ms Hawke not only identified the appellant to be the person who she saw strike Mr Waters, later she identified him in a computer identification process. Her evidence was that others present had also told her that it was the appellant who had struck Mr Waters. Her only previous sighting of the appellant had, however, been brief and she conceded in cross-examination that she could have been wrong in her identification of him as the person who struck Mr Waters. 

101His Honour gave the jury a direction as to the special caution with which such identification evidence had to be approached, even if Ms Hawke was accepted as an entirely honest witness, given that such identification evidence might be unreliable for reasons which he properly explained, so that the circumstances in which she made her observations had to be carefully considered.

102In the face of these conflicts in the evidence and the concessions made by various of the witnesses, I consider that the Crown did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who struck Mr Waters with the machete. 

103That in the confusion there was a real possibility of misidentification of the appellant as the person who hit Mr Waters over the head with the weapon, which caused the laceration, must be accepted. Neither Mr Waters nor Mr Peterson identified the appellant as the person who inflicted that head wound. They both knew the appellant, as did Mr Sampson. Ms Hawke had only briefly seen the appellant on one earlier occasion, but it was a sufficient observation to permit her to identify him in the later computer line up as one of those involved in the attack on Mr Waters. She conceded however, that her identification of him as the person who had inflicted the wound, could have been wrong. While Mr Sampson also identified the appellant as that assailant, his description of the clothing that person was wearing, did not accord with Ms Hawkin's description of that assailant's clothing. 

104On all of this evidence, that Mr Sampson and Ms Hawke were mistaken as to the identity of the person who inflicted Mr Waters' head wound must be accepted as possible. Given the frenzied activity which the witnesses described was occurring during this affray; where the attack occurred; where the witnesses were variously located; and what they were themselves doing when Mr Waters was struck, particularly Mr Sampson, who was defending himself by throwing objects at those attacking him; how the person who wielded the machete was described by Ms Kedwell; and the conflicting accounts of what the appellant and the assailant were wearing, while I have not been left with a doubt that the appellant was involved in the attack on Mr Waters, I have been left with a real doubt that the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who actually wielded the weapon that wounded Mr Waters' head. 

105In my view that is a doubt which the jury ought to have shared. It is not a doubt which the jury's advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence was capable of resolving.

106Given however, that I do not have such a doubt as to the appellant's involvement in the joint criminal enterprise on which the Crown's alternative case rested, in the result this ground of appeal must also be dismissed.

Ground 3 - the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and/or it was not open to the trial judge to sentence the appellant on the basis that he inflicted the wounds

107The Crown conceded that the appellant must be re-sentenced, as I earlier explained. For reasons which I have explained, in my view the appellant also established that it was not open to his Honour to sentence him on the basis that he inflicted the head wound which Mr Waters suffered. The Crown submitted that even if this conclusion were to be reached, the sentence would not be disturbed, because the Court would not be satisfied that any lesser sentence was warranted in law. 

108For the following reasons I am satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted and that the appellant must be re-sentenced accordingly. 

109This sentencing exercise was plainly a difficult one. It had to be conducted in light of the provisions of s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure ) Act 1999 which provides:

""3A Purposes of sentencing
The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:
(a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence,
(b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences,
(c) to protect the community from the offender,
(d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender,
(e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions,
(f) to denounce the conduct of the offender,
(g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.""

110As Gleeson CJ said in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68: 

""[T]he interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex ... In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. ...

It is therefore erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances.""


111His Honour concluded that there was no remorse or contrition on the appellant's part and not much prospect of rehabilitation, given the evidence of his history and attitude. Those conclusions were properly available on the evidence.

112He also considered that it was fortunate that Mr Waters had not been more seriously harmed and that the sentence imposed had to reflect both general and specific deterrence. In the result, he considered that no penalty other than imprisonment was warranted. As the result of the finding of special circumstances, he reduced the non-parole period in the appellant's favour, by some 4 months and 2 weeks to allow for a period of 2 years on parole. That the appellant requires extended supervision once released is apparent. 

113The appellant did not challenge any of these findings. His case on sentencing was that the total effective sentence of six and a half years imprisonment and four and a half years non-parole, was manifestly excessive because:

the evidence did not establish beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who wounded Mr Waters; 

that he was being sentenced for the less serious version of s33, 'wound with intent' not 'inflict grievous bodily harm with intent; 

the nature of the wound inflicted

the provocation of the offender by others present with Mr Waters

the difficulty of the offenders upbringing and background (see R v Fernando )

that he ought to have been sentenced on the basis that he inspired the attack, rather than that he recruited to attackers

the degree of accumulation was excessive 


114The appellant also relied on a number of other decisions in which lesser sentences than that which his Honour fixed were imposed, which the Crown submitted were factually distinguishable and not of assistance in this case. It is not necessary to refer to them. These cases where not of assistance, given their factually different circumstances. 

115The maximum penalty for the s 93 offence was 10 years. The maximum penalty for the s 33 offence was 25 years imprisonment, with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. They were guideposts on sentencing which had to be taken into account, as was explained in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357. 

116Given that his Honour sentenced the appellant on the basis that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had not only either recruited the other offenders involved in the attack on Mr Waters, or at least inspired the attack in which he joined, but had also inflicted the major injury which Mr Walters suffered, it is arguable that the sentence imposed upon him was not a heavy one. While his Honour gave an explanation for the former conclusion, he did not explain how he had come to the latter conclusion. As I have explained, his Honour erred in that regard. 

117The sentence which his Honour imposed reflects the conclusion which he reached as to the seriousness of the injuries inflicted on Mr Waters, which had no significant sequelae and which his Honour considered were 'far less significant than might otherwise have been the case in different circumstances'. That is a conclusion with which I agree.

118As the Crown accepted, the nature and extent of the injuries inflicted must be appropriately reflected in the sentence that is imposed (see Bourke v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 22; (2010) 199 A Crim R 38 at [49] and [70] - [72]). So must the overall objective seriousness of the offence. Objectively this would have been a much more serious offence, if the Crown had established that the appellant not only had the moral culpability of his involvement in this joint criminal enterprise, but had also himself wielded the weapon which inflicted the head would which Mr Waters suffered.

119The appellant's offence was still plainly a serious one. It was very closely connected with the affray offence, during which Mr Waters was particularly targeted. This is not a case where the two offences involved entirely discrete and independent criminal acts. The total sentence imposed must nevertheless reflect the total criminality of the two offences (see Cahyadi v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27]). His Honour accumulated the sentence imposed for the s 33 offence by 6 months. I can see no error in that conclusion in the circumstances of the two offences earlier discussed.

120The sentence imposed also reflected the conclusions which his Honour reached as to the appellant's subjective circumstances and other relevant matters to which his Honour referred.

121The evidence in that regard was that the appellant is an Aboriginal man, with a long criminal record. He gave no evidence and so it must be remembered that his various reports of his background and personal circumstances were untested. 

122The pre-sentence report referred to his ongoing involvement with the Probation and Parole Service since 1990, when he breached a community service order for offences of malicious injury and common assault. There had subsequently been a number of parole revocations and further offending in 2009, while he was on parole. 

123This report revealed that the appellant was one of seven children. His father died in a car accident in which he was also involved, when he was aged 15. He had been adversely affected by his death, as well as by the death of a young nephew, who drowned in an accident. 

124The appellant had four children from an earlier relationship characterised by domestic violence, three of them then adults. He was also involved in another relationship of 12 years duration, which had resulted in five children and his partner was then expecting a sixth. This relationship had also been marred by violence and alcohol use. There had been a history of AVO intervention. The three eldest of these children were in long-term care with relatives, as the result of child protection concerns. The two youngest children remained in their mother's care.

125The appellant reported completion of schooling only to year 7, with the assistance of a specialised learning program, before expulsion for violence which he attributed to bullying. He had completed some external education courses by correspondence and was involved in various community Aboriginal roles. His work history had primarily involved seasonal farm work learned from his father. There had also been construction work, but he was then in receipt of a Commonwealth benefit.

126The appellant disclosed alcohol dependence after his father's death, with almost daily alcohol use to the point of intoxication, with the result on some occasions that he slept on a riverbank. He reported never having had a significant period without alcohol consumption, other than during incarceration. He also had a history of sniffing liquid paper and petrol in childhood and later cannabis use. There had been unsuccessful rehabilitation attempts.

127The appellant also reported a history of animosity between the familles in the area in which the offences occurred, but denied any responsibility for the offences. He claimed that his own relatives were responsible and that they had not owned up to their involvement. This had caused a rift in the family unit. He could not accept punishment for an act which he did not commit. 

128A psychologist's report noted that the appellant appeared agitated and confused, experiencing difficulty containing his anger. He revealed fixed beliefs that his co-accused should be punished and that he would seek revenge, if given a long period of incarceration. While he was forthcoming with information, his account was described as tangential, circular and inconsistent. He was a poor historian who felt mistreated by the judicial system, expressing a strong sense of anger and difficulty regulating his emotions.

129The history given as to his background differed somewhat to that in the pre-sentencing report. The psychologist recorded that he was one of 11 children born to his parents, that it was his sister, not his nephew who had drowned as a child, that two of his brothers had died in a car accident when he was a toddler and that his nephew had died from drowning when he was aged 18 years. He also described his father dying in his arms, in the car accident in which he died and his feelings of responsibility for the death of his father, sister and nephew.

130He described his father as a sheep shearer and his mother having household duties. They had a volatile relationship triggered by his mother's alcoholism and infidelity and his father's domestic abuse towards her, which normalised such behaviour for him. His parents struggled financially, because all of their finances were spent on alcohol, which his father also abused. The appellant's father imposed strict boundaries on him which he considered that he required, as he was often rebellious and difficult to manage. After his father's death he often isolated himself for several weeks and was unable to sustain stable employment. His behavioural problems escalated and he was involved in fighting, aggression and expressed depressed moods, blaming himself for being unable to save his dad.

131The appellant described his mother a lifelong alcoholic, until some 15 years ago, when she became involved in a church, to which point the appellant described her as having been drunk for over 30 years. He continued to express his anger towards her for her abusive behaviour towards him. He described her problems after his father's death and how she abused alcohol and cannabis and suffered from depression and how she treated him unequally, by comparison to his younger siblings.

132He also described his volatile relationship with his siblings, for whom he had felt over responsible after his father's death. He described his abuse of them as a means of gaining control over his own life, before his father's death and how this changed when his mother became more available afterwards and he moved to Sydney. He had been living with his sister and her partner when he became involved in his current offending. He then had no contact with his siblings and held a great deal of anger and resentment to his sister and her partner, for putting him in gaol. 

133He had first come into custody when aged 12 years and spent much of his adolescence in juvenile detention, and much of his adult life in prison. He was regularly in trouble, even in primary school, for fighting and misbehaving, but claimed never to have been seriously disciplined at school. His problems escalated in secondary school. His education ceased in year 7 when he assaulted a student and a teacher and was expelled. Despite attempts in institutions, he never completed his schooling and had only completed short courses in custody. He had worked in seasonal and construction work for periods of six months when not in custody. He was unreliable because of his alcohol use. He aimed to find employment when released.

134His medical history included stabbing injuries in the leg and chest when aged 20, 30 and 41. As a result he experienced hyper vigilance when someone was armed with a knife. He had also been shot in the knee, but suffered no permanent injuries other than scarring and had been run over by a semitrailer, suffering a broken foot and shattered knee, which required treatment. He had also been hit in the head on a number of occasions in physical altercations, but denied any specific injury. He had also punched a window a month previously, when his daughter refused to be a witness. 

135He described mischievous displays of attention seeking behaviour and exposure to alcohol and substance abuse throughout his life, by friends and family. He reported such abuse as part of his family and peer subculture and association through his adolescence and adulthood with antisocial peers and relatives. The psychologist considered that his limited prosocial peer relationships had reinforced his negative lifestyle, poor decisions and continued substance abuse and criminality.

136The appellant reported exposure to cannabis at age 13 and to alcohol at age 14. After his father's death alcohol use increased to daily intake, to the point of blacking out. While intoxicated he was involved in aggressive behaviour, fighting with both strangers and family. In the community the longest period he had spent alcohol free was one month. He did not experience difficulty abstaining while in custody, but used alcohol to self medicate. His alcohol abuse led directly to increased aggressive and criminal behaviour. 

137He also reported that cannabis use was a strong part of the Aboriginal subculture within his local community. It was normalised for him. He reported daily dependent cannabis use of one pound a week, to relax or calm his aggression. He claimed that it made him think and analyse things and helped him feel remorseful. He also described experiencing symptoms of paranoia when smoking hydroponic cannabis. He had also experimented with hallucinogens, but he claimed not to a problematic extent. 

138He reported attempting various residential rehabilitation programs on about five occasions. He ceased these programs prematurely after lapsing back into substance abuse. He also reported regular gambling of $500 to $600 a day in his 20's to 30's which had ceased. He then engaged in only non-problematic gambling.

139The appellant reported having a distant relationship with his four daughters from his first relationship. His second relationship had then produced six children, but it had also ended shortly before he went into custody. He described that he now had a hostile relationship with his former partner and that the oldest three of these children were in care due to his absence and his former partner's drug abuse and reckless behaviour. She had allowed drug users and strangers into the home, while the children were present. He was unable to care for them because of his own alcohol use and unstable accommodation. He had not seen them for some nine months. Despite the negative relationship he described with his former partner, he also reported considering returning to her.

140The psychologist observed that the appellant appeared to lack the emotional maturity to comprehend the impact of his behaviour on his children and what fulfilling his basic parental responsibilities required. 

141The appellant acknowledged his presence at the time of these offences, but denied his involvement in them. He expressed a strong feeling of having been 'hard done by and wanting revenge' against his co-offender and a strong sense of injustice.

142The psychologist expressed reservations as to certain exaggerated symptoms and eccentric statements which the appellant made, but noted that he denied symptoms of various mental illness. She noted his exposure to significant stressors, various symptoms of anxiety and how he became angry and verbalised this. He also described ongoing symptoms of depressed mood, the result of his dysfunctional life and reported three occasions of self harm some years previously, when he also behaved aggressively towards his partner, as well as on another occasion when he had been wrongly incarcerated. 

143The appellant acknowledged his history of antisocial traits, anger management concerns and aggressive behaviour, which occurred in the context of personal stressors, symptoms of acute drug withdrawal and paranoid thinking. He was easily triggered by authority figures and what he perceived as threats, to which he responded with aggression and hostility. He also described a lack of regard for others, becoming defensive when he felt like a political prisoner and being preoccupied with wanting to seek revenge by harming others who mocked him. He had never participated in anger management programs or consulted health professionals and could not identify adaptive coping strategies to deal with anger or stress.

144In the result the psychologist concluded that the appellant was highly dysfunctional and that he had little capacity for independent or functional community participation, while he continued to abuse substances. His test results showed him to be at low average functioning; that he had chronic problems with anger control; that he condoned aggression in certain contexts; that he had problems with emotion regulation and stress management and limited life management skills. 

145It was observed that the appellant gave a seemingly confusing and contradictory account, with fixated beliefs and thoughts about being mistreated by the criminal justice system. His long history of offending was constant, despite sanction, dating back to 12 years of age and involving numerous driving offences, drug related offences and offences of violence. He had limited insight into his offending and externalised responsibly for it, expressing strong feelings of victimisation and being wrongly accused. He had poor insight or commitment into his rehabilitative needs. His coping skills were found to be limited and would have a profound impact on his behaviour, including in relation to drug dependence, impulse control problems, aggressions and ultimately crime. 

146Various treatments were recommended, including long term rehabilitation for substance dependence and ongoing supervision on release into the community, including treatment for long term offenders who present problems in relation to institutionalisation. It was considered that the appellant required staged release into the community and supervision, to help develop living skills. Participation in the Community Offender Support and Violent Offenders programs, as well as other identified programs was recommended, it being noted that repeated incarceration had done little in terms of prevention of the appellant's further offending, 

147His Honour accepted that this background provided some limited mitigation for the appellant's offending, consistent with R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58. This aspect of the re-sentencing exercise must now be approached in light of the recent discussions in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37 and Munda v Western Australia [2013] HCA 38. There reference was made to what Brennan J observed in Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55; (1982) 149 CLR 305 at [63]:
""The same sentencing principles are to be applied, of course, in every case, irrespective of the identity of a particular offender or his membership of an ethnic or other group. But in imposing sentences courts are bound to take into account, in accordance with those principles, all material facts including those facts which exist only by reason of the offender's membership of an ethnic or other group. So much is essential to the even administration of criminal justice. That done, however, the weight to be attributed to the factors material in a particular case, whether of aggravation or mitigation, is ordinarily a matter for the court exercising the sentencing discretion of first instance or for the Court of Criminal Appeal.""


148Also to be considered is what was observed by the plurality in Bugmy as to Fernando, at [37] - [38] that:

[37] An Aboriginal offender's deprived background may mitigate the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate for the offence in the same way that the deprived background of a non-Aboriginal offender may mitigate that offender's sentence. In this respect, Simpson J has correctly explained the significance of the statements in Fernando [Kennedy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 260 at [53]]:

""Properly understood, Fernando is a decision, not about sentencing Aboriginals, but about the recognition, in sentencing decisions, of social disadvantage that frequently (no matter what the ethnicity of the offender) precedes the commission of crime.

[38] The propositions stated in Fernando are largely directed to the significance of the circumstance that the offender was intoxicated at the time of the offence. As Wood J explained, drunkenness does not usually operate by way of excuse or to mitigate an offender's conduct [Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 62 (E)]. However, his Honour recognised that there are Aboriginal communities in which alcohol abuse and alcohol-related violence go hand in hand [Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 62 (C).]. His Honour considered that where an offender's abuse of alcohol is a reflection of the environment in which he or she was raised it should be taken into account as a mitigating factor [Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 62 (E)]. To do so, he said, is to acknowledge the endemic presence of alcohol in Aboriginal communities and [Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58 at 62-63 (E).]:

""the grave social difficulties faced by those communities where poor self-image, absence of education and work opportunity and other demoralising factors have placed heavy stresses on them, reinforcing their resort to alcohol and compounding its worst effects."" ""


149At [42] it was accepted that in the case of an offender who, like the appellant, has come from a profoundly deprived background, suffering the effects of drug and alcohol abuse and violence, the effects of that deprivation do not diminish over time and must 'be given full weight'. As to this it was explained:

[44] Because the effects of profound childhood deprivation do not diminish with the passage of time and repeated offending, it is right to speak of giving ""full weight"" to an offender's deprived background in every sentencing decision. However, this is not to suggest, as the appellant's submissions were apt to do, that an offender's deprived background has the same (mitigatory) relevance for all of the purposes of punishment. Giving weight to the conflicting purposes of punishment is what makes the exercise of the discretion so difficult [Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476 per Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ; [1988] HCA 14.]. An offender's childhood exposure to extreme violence and alcohol abuse may explain the offender's recourse to violence when frustrated such that the offender's moral culpability for the inability to control that impulse may be substantially reduced. However, the inability to control the violent response to frustration may increase the importance of protecting the community from the offender. 

[45] The point was made by Gleeson CJ in Engert in the context of explaining the significance of an offender's mental condition in sentencing [(1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68.]:

""A moment's consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration. For example, in the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean that deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. That was the particular problem being examined by the court in the case of Veen (No 2). Again, in a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence, might, at the same time increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.""


150This is such a case. The evidence of the appellant's awful childhood experiences of violence and drug and alcohol abuse, cast significant light on his ongoing problems with anger management, violence and criminal conduct throughout his adult life, so as to reduce his moral culpability for his inability to control himself. To be weighed against this is not only his serious lack of control, which has resulted in his extensive criminal record, but also his lack of remorse and expressed desire for revenge and retribution, particularly on his co-accused and family members. This aspect of the evidence points strongly to an increased need to protect the community from the appellant.

151In Munda it was observed by the plurality at [53] - [54] that:

[53] Mitigating factors must be given appropriate weight, but they must not be allowed ""to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence.""[ Veen v The Queen [No 2] (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477;; [1988] HCA 14.] It would be contrary to the principle stated by Brennan J in Neal to accept that Aboriginal offending is to be viewed systemically as less serious than offending by persons of other ethnicities. To accept that Aboriginal offenders are in general less responsible for their actions than other persons would be to deny Aboriginal people their full measure of human dignity. It would be quite inconsistent with the statement of principle in Neal to act upon a kind of racial stereotyping which diminishes the dignity of individual offenders by consigning them, by reason of their race and place of residence, to a category of persons who are less capable than others of decent behaviour [R v KU; Ex parte Attorney-General (No 2) [2011] 1 Qd R 439 at 475-476 [133] .]. Further, it would be wrong to accept that a victim of violence by an Aboriginal offender is somehow less in need, or deserving, of such protection and vindication as the criminal law can provide. 

[54] It may be argued that general deterrence has little rational claim upon the sentencing discretion in relation to crimes which are not premeditated. That argument has special force where prolonged and widespread social disadvantage has produced communities so demoralised or alienated that it is unreasonable to expect the conduct of individuals within those communities to be controlled by rational calculation of the consequences of misconduct. In such cases it may be said that heavy sentences are likely to be of little utility in reducing the general incidence of crimes, especially crimes of passion. That having been said, there are three points to be made in response. First, the proper role of the criminal law is not limited to the utilitarian value of general deterrence. The criminal law is more than a mode of social engineering which operates by providing disincentives directed to reducing unacceptably deviant behaviour within the community. To view the criminal law exclusively, or even principally, as a mechanism for the regulation of the risks of deviant behaviour is to fail to recognise the long-standing obligation of the state to vindicate the dignity of each victim of violence, to express the community's disapproval of that offending, and to afford such protection as can be afforded by the state to the vulnerable against repetition of violence. Further, one of the historical functions of the criminal law has been to discourage victims and their friends and families from resorting to self-help, and the consequent escalation of violent vendettas between members of the community.""


152These observations are pertinent to the sentencing exercise which must be undertaken in this case, given the evidence that the offending in which the appellant and his co-offenders were involved on this occasion was premeditated. All of these matters must be weighed in the balance when the instinctive synthesis discussed in R v Markarian is undertaken. 

153Given the evidence I have discussed as to the nature of this affray and of the appellant's involvement in the attack on Mr Waters, the evidence of the appellant's attitude to the others involved with him in that offending, his stated desire for revenge upon them and his general attitude to violence, in my view in this case both general and specific deterrence must feature in the sentence imposed, even though it must be accepted that the appellant's moral culpability for his inability to exercise self control is reduced by the ongoing effects of his deprived upbringing and social deprivation, which must also be taken into account.

154In the result, I have concluded that after a finding special circumstances to permit the type of ongoing supervision which the appellant will clearly require once released into the community, the appellant should be sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 6 years, with a non-parole period of 4 years and a balance of term of 2 years. The sentence must have regard to the 19 days that he spent bail refused in relation to these offences.

155The orders I would propose are as follows:

1. The conviction appeal is dismissed. 

2. Leave to appeal on sentence is granted.

3. The sentences imposed by King DCJ be quashed and in lieu the appellant be sentenced as follows:

On the s 93C affray charge a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 20 January 2012 and expiring on 19 July 2013.

On the s 33 wounding offence a non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months commencing on 20 July 2012 and expiring on 19 January 2016, with a balance of term of 2 years, commencing on 20 January 2016 and expiring on 19 January 2018. 

The first date the appellant is eligible for release on parole is 20 January 2016.

2705830,Sinkovich v Attorney General of New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 383,"Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA for the reasons given by his Honour.

2I also agree with the additional reasons of Beech-Jones J.

3BEAZLEY P: I have had the opportunity of reading in draft the reasons of Basten JA and the additional comments of Price J and Beech-Jones J. I agree with the declaration proposed by Basten JA.

4BASTEN JA: In 2009 Frank Sinkovich (the applicant) was convicted following a trial of two offences relating to the supply of methylamphetamine. The more serious offence (supply a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine) carried a standard non-parole period of 10 years. In November 2009 he was sentenced to imprisonment for 14 years, with a 10 year non-parole period. He appealed against his sentence but, on 15 April 2011, his appeal was dismissed: Sinkovich v R [2011] NSWCCA 90.

5In imposing sentence, the trial judge followed the guidance of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 in relation to sentencing for an offence in relation to which a standard non-parole period applied, under Pt 4, Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). However, on 5 October 2011, some six months after the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed his appeal, the High Court delivered judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120, holding that the guidance given in Way was erroneous. 

6Since the judgment in Muldrock, there have been a significant number of cases challenging the approach of sentencing judges who had (correctly at the time) followed the guidance of Way, which tended to result in higher sentences than would application of the principles laid down in Muldrock. In some cases, such challenges could be dealt with in the ordinary course of an appeal against sentence, within time, under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 5. Other cases required an extension of time in which to seek leave to appeal. A third category of cases involved offenders who had already exercised their rights of appeal against sentence prior to the judgment of the High Court in Muldrock.

7The applicant falls into the third category. Having exercised his right to appeal against sentence (whether or not on the ground now raised) he had no further right of appeal: Grierson v The King [1938] HCA 45; 60 CLR 431, applied in Elliott v The Queen [2007] HCA 51; 234 CLR 38 at [7] and Burrell v The Queen [2008] HCA 34; 238 CLR 218 at [24]. He was not, however, precluded from making an application for an inquiry into his sentence pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (""the Appeal and Review Act""). On 10 July 2013 the applicant filed an application in the Supreme Court. (The reasons for the lapse of time in taking that step were set out in an affidavit of Ms Schneider, the solicitor in charge of the Indictable Appeals Unit of Legal Aid NSW.)

8The application was considered by Latham J. On 17 September 2013 she refused the application, giving reasons for her decision: Application by Frank Sinkovich pursuant to s 78 Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2013] NSWSC 1342. Those reasons, being publicly available, need not be recounted here. It is sufficient to refer to two particular passages. First, having set out the basis on which the appeal was dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal, Latham J stated at [9]:

""It is patently clear from these extracts that the applicant's submissions on this application are well-founded, to the extent that the sentencing judge and the Court of Criminal Appeal applied sentencing principles that have since been discredited. The Attorney General takes no issue with this aspect of the application. However, the Attorney General does take issue with the proposition that the change in sentencing practice brought about by the High Court's decision in Muldrock is capable of meeting the criteria in s 79. In other words, the Attorney General contends that an error of this type does not constitute a 'mitigating circumstance'.""

9Then, having reviewed the history of the legislation and such authorities as have considered its operation, Latham J concluded that the construction of the phrase ""mitigating circumstances"", in s 79(2) of the Appeal and Review Act, could not ""be strained to accommodate errors of law"": at [23]. At [33] she noted:

""I am not aware of any application for an inquiry into conviction or sentence that has proceeded solely on the basis that the law, although correctly applied at the time of the relevant proceedings before a court, has changed after the applicant had exhausted his/her appeal rights. Even before an offender's appeal rights have been exhausted, the principle of finality may play a decisive role in dismissing an appeal or refusing to grant an extension of time within which to file an appeal, where the law has changed between conviction, sentence and appeal.""

10The final conclusion in Latham J's reasoning was as follows, at [38]:

""I am of the view that the Attorney General's submissions concerning the interpretation of s 79 must be accepted, despite the evident disparity between those offenders who exercised their right of appeal against sentence pre-Muldrock and those who did not. That disparity is the result of a change in the law, the consequences of which have been resolutely met by the application of the concept of merger. There is nothing in the statutory scheme of Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act that evinces an intention to depart from that precept.""

11Before leaving the reasons, it is necessary to note what was referred to as ""a change in the law"". There had been no change in the relevant legal principles, the statutory provisions with respect to standard non-parole periods having remained the same at all relevant times. What had changed was the identification by the High Court of a misapprehension as to the proper construction of the statute by the Court of Criminal Appeal which, in turn, had been followed (correctly in terms of precedent) by sentencing judges and in later appellate judgments, until the error was identified. The significance of this change will be addressed further below.

Application for review by this Court
12It will be necessary to explain the legislative scheme of Part 7 of the Appeal and Review Act in detail: it is sufficient at this stage to note that the consideration of an application for an inquiry into a sentence, as undertaken by Latham J, was not an exercise of judicial power. There was no appeal from her decision. However, the applicant said that he had a right to invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) and, in the event that he could establish a relevant legal error in the determination made by Latham J, could invoke appropriate relief, either by an order quashing the refusal, or an order requiring Latham J to determine his application according to law. In the alternative, he sought declaratory relief in the event that other orders were deemed to be inappropriate: Supreme Court Act, s 75. He did not suggest that the grounds differed according to the nature of the relief.

13It is not insignificant in relation to the available relief that the second respondent to the application was named as Justice Latham. In relation to judicial review proceedings the decision-maker is properly named as a party who must be bound by the judgment of the Court. However, unless the decision-maker acts as an individual, the responsible body should be named and not the individual. That principle applies to office-holders generally and not only courts and tribunals: Brown v Rezitis [1970] HCA 56; 127 CLR 157 at 169 (Barwick CJ); Kerr v Commissioner of Police [1977] 2 NSWLR 721 at 724-725 (Moffitt P, Hope and Samuels JJA agreeing); Re Ruddock; Ex parte Reyes [2000] HCA 66; 75 ALJR 465 at [25]; SAAP v Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs [2005] HCA 24; 228 CLR 294 at [43] (McHugh J); Police Integrity Commission v Shaw [2006] NSWCA 165; 66 NSWLR 446 at [43]. An application for an inquiry under Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act is, as appears below, made ""to the Supreme Court"" and any direction or referral made upon considering the application is also made ""by the Supreme Court"": ss 78(1) and 79(1) set out at [15] below. It is therefore appropriate that the second respondent not be named as an individual judge, but as the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

The statutory provisions
14Part 7 of the Appeal and Review Act is headed ""Review of convictions and sentences"". The two operative Divisions for present purposes are those which deal with the commencement of claims made for review or inquiry of a conviction or sentence. Division 2 is headed ""Petitions to Governor"" and provides a mechanism for invoking the exercise of ""the Governor's pardoning power"": s 76. It may be invoked by a ""petition for a review of a conviction or sentence"", pursuant to s 76. That was not the procedure adopted in the present case.

15Division 3 is headed ""Applications to Supreme Court"". It was this procedure which was adopted by the applicant. The key provisions are as follows:

78 Applications to Supreme Court

(1) An application for an inquiry into a conviction or sentence may be made to the Supreme Court by the convicted person or by another person on behalf of the convicted person.

(2) The registrar of the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court must cause a copy of any application made under this section to be given to the Minister.

79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or
(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person's guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or
(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or
(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or
(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.
...
(4) Proceedings under this section are not judicial proceedings. However, the Supreme Court may consider any written submissions made by the Crown with respect to an application. ...

16Division 4 provides for the conduct of an inquiry where one has been directed, relevantly for present purposes, under s 79(1)(a). Division 5 deals with the procedure and powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal, in the event that the case is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal. This may occur directly upon considering an application, pursuant to s 79(1)(b) or following completion of an inquiry, pursuant to s 82(2). 

17Part 7 also deals with applications to the ""DNA Review Panel"", under Division 6, but nothing turns on these provisions for present purposes. Indeed, little reference was made to the powers of the Court of Criminal Appeal under Pt 7. It is sufficient for present purposes to note that where a case is referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 79(1)(b) the Court is required to deal with the case ""in the same way as if the convicted person had appealed against the conviction or sentence under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912"": s 86. 

Issues
18The primary issue in the present proceeding turned on the scope of an application for an inquiry permitted under Pt 7. The submissions for the applicant focused on the absence of limitation on that which could be applied for, beyond being ""an inquiry into a conviction or sentence"", as provided in s 78(1). In support of that submission, the applicant drew attention to Div 1, headed ""Preliminary"" which included the following provision:

74 Definitions

...

(2) In this Part, a reference to a review of, or an inquiry into, a conviction or sentence includes a reference to a review of, or an inquiry into, any aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence.

19For present purposes, the operation of this provision can be simplified by putting to one side references to ""a review"", as that is the language adopted with respect to a petition to the Governor. The present application, made under s 78, was for an inquiry. Accordingly, in its terms, s 74(2) provides an expansive definition by which any reference to ""an inquiry into a conviction or sentence"" includes a reference to ""an inquiry into any aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence"". Those words, the applicant submitted, are inconsistent with any implied limitation on the scope of the matters for inquiry. 

20The focus of the submissions for the Attorney, for whom the Crown Advocate appeared, and who sought to uphold the reasoning of Latham J, had three elements. First, it was submitted that s 74(2) was not properly understood as a ""definition"", but even if it were appropriate to so treat it, the term ""inquiry"" did not appear in the critical gateway provision, namely s 79(2). 

21The second aspect of the Attorney's approach, which was linked to the first, was to emphasise the language of s 79(2), and particularly the requirement for ""a doubt or question as to ... any mitigating circumstances in the case"". That language, it was submitted, should be understood in its historical context, which, in this State, dated back to 1883. That language should govern the scope of the provision, absent any indication in the legislative history that s 74(2), first introduced in 1996, was intended to broaden the circumstances in which an inquiry could be held.

22The third aspect of the Attorney's submissions related to what was described as ""the principle of finality"". That principle, it was submitted, was reflected in the concept of ""merger"", by which any liability of the offender under the criminal law merged into the final judgment or order of the court, being the conviction of and sentence for the offence as charged. Whilst it was acknowledged that Pt 7 itself constituted a qualification of the principle of finality, the Attorney submitted that the qualification should not be permitted to expand beyond the stated parameters.

Operation of the statutory scheme
23In order to address the respective submissions, it is preferable to start with the current statutory language. That is because the earliest statutory predecessor to Pt 7 was s 383 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 (NSW), which pre-dated by almost three decades the first general right of appeal in criminal matters in this State. In these circumstances, precise continuity of purpose or approach cannot be assumed.

24It is convenient to start with the language of s 79(2), upon which the Crown Advocate placed significant weight. An application to the Supreme Court may have one of three outcomes: 

(a) it may result in a direction for the conduct of an inquiry - s 79(1)(a);
(b) the referral of the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal (without an inquiry) - s 79(1)(b) or
(c) refusal to take either step (a) or (b).

25The direction of an inquiry or referral of the case to the Court of Criminal Appeal are actions available under s 79(1) which ""may only be taken if"" the gateway in sub-s (2) is passed. That is language of confinement: there is no power in the court to take action under s 79(1) unless a specified condition is fulfilled.

26The action is to be taken by the Supreme Court, which means a judge authorised by the Chief Justice pursuant to s 75(1). Action can be taken only if it ""appears"" to the judge that the condition is satisfied. In other words, it is the satisfaction of the judge as to the relevant condition which is critical. (That does not, of course, mean that the judge's decision is for that reason unreviewable, although the grounds and basis of review involve questions which will be addressed below.)

27The content of the condition as to which the judge must be satisfied is somewhat obscurely worded. The necessary state of mind requires a ""doubt or question"" as to (i) the convicted person's guilt, (ii) any mitigating circumstances in the case, or (iii) any part of the evidence in the case. However, neither the syntax nor the nature of the various elements permits any precise identification of the scope of the condition. Thus, a doubt or question as to a person's guilt could involve a doubt or question as to the procedural steps in the trial, admission of evidence, rejection of evidence, weight of the evidence, directions to the jury or any other matter upon which a finding of guilt is dependent. That includes a doubt or question as to the fitness of the accused to plead: Eastman v Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) [2003] HCA 28; 214 CLR 318 at [125] (Heydon J, with whom members of the Court other than McHugh J each agreed).

28The second element, ""any mitigating circumstances"", is not of the same kind as ""guilt"". Reading the words in their ordinary meaning, the Crown Advocate submitted that there must be circumstances, that is events or happenings, which mitigated the culpability of the accused. She conceded that such circumstances could include the state of mind of the accused or a relevant mental illness or disability of the accused, which could affect both liability for the offence and moral culpability, as relevant to sentencing for the offence. Dealing only with the question of sentence, the precise operation of the phrase is obscure. The offender would hardly complain of mitigating circumstances which had been taken into account, although no doubt the offender would have grounds for complaint if significant mitigating circumstances were not taken into account and might wish to raise factual matters which were not known to the sentencing judge. 

29It would seem curious if no inquiry could be held where the sentencing judge had, mistakenly, sentenced on the basis of an extensive criminal record which related to another person. Although it might be possible to say that the absence of such a criminal record was a ""mitigating circumstance"", that would be an artificial way of describing the error which had occurred. Similarly, the sentencing judge might have sentenced on the basis of a misapprehension as to the maximum penalty for the offence believing, for example, that it was significantly higher than that in fact prescribed. That such mistakes occur is undoubted: if the error were to be disclosed only after an appeal had been dismissed, it would seem curious that the offender could have no right of relief. The section does not limit the relationship of the doubt or question to its subject matter, and must allow for a range of connections.

30As already noted, the three elements in s 79(2) are not self-contained. In Eastman, Heydon J noted that reference to a doubt or question about ""any portion of the evidence"" gave a significant clue as to the breadth of the inquiry with respect to guilt, suggesting that the process of finding guilt was covered: at [135]. One of the points of significance raised by the Director in Eastman was that the equivalent provision discussed in that case referred, as does s 79(2), to ""guilt"" rather than ""conviction"". Section 79(2) does not refer to sentence at all, although it is beyond doubt that there may be an inquiry into a sentence, because that term is expressly used in s 78(1). The looseness of the fit of the language as between ss 78(1) and 79(2) militates against reliance on the precise terms of s 79(2) to impose restrictions on the scope of the matters which an applicant may seek to raise in applying for an inquiry.

31Further, the submission of the Crown Advocate that s 74(2) has no direct application to s 79(2) cannot be accepted. Although the word ""inquiry"" does not appear in the latter provision, the reference to ""[a]ction under subsection (1)"" refers, relevantly, to a direction that ""an inquiry be conducted ... into the ... sentence"". That is the precise phrase which is said by s 74(2) to extend to ""any aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the ... sentence"". Whether that constitutes a ""definition"" (as described in the heading of the section, which is not part of the section - Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW), s 35) is immaterial: if s 74(2) is to be given effect according to its terms, it must be possible for the Supreme Court to direct an inquiry into any aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the sentence. In accordance with Eastman, that would include a procedural error. Any procedural error which possibly gave rise to a more severe sentence than should properly have been imposed, may found a doubt or question as to a mitigating circumstance; that is, the failure to sentence the prisoner on a basis which would have led to a less severe sentence than that imposed.

32If that reasoning is correct, there is no basis in the language to exclude errors of law: indeed, it will often be easier to identify a miscarriage of justice which has resulted from an error of law than one resulting from a mistake as to some matter of fact.

Statutory history
33The parties placed some weight in the course of submissions on the history of the provisions which are now found in Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act. Much of that history was set out by Heydon J in Eastman and has recently been referred to by this Court in Patsalis v Attorney General for New South Wales [2013] NSWCA 343. Without disrespect to the diligence of counsel and the comprehensive nature of the written submissions setting out the legislative history, it is sufficient for present purposes to refer only to those aspects which directly bear upon the present issues. 

34The first aspect of the history, as has already been noted, was that the original sections of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1883 pre-dated any statutory right of appeal with respect to convictions and sentences for criminal offences. The quite limited opportunity for correction of error by judicial process was referred to by Heydon J in Eastman at [70]. Otherwise, apparent miscarriages of justice could only be remedied by the exercise by the executive of a power to pardon an offender. That situation was widely perceived to be unsatisfactory, particularly in the absence of any clear procedure for invoking the power, any statement of grounds upon which the power should be exercised and given the inadequacy of the consequences. Thus, it was readily appreciated that for the Governor to pardon a person who was believed not to be guilty of any offence was incoherent. 

35The relevance of the 1883 Amendment Act for present purposes is twofold. First, the power to conduct an inquiry and thus to summon and examine persons on oath was contingent upon satisfaction as to ""any doubt or question ... as to his guilt or any mitigating circumstance in the case or any portion of the evidence therein"", being language reflected in s 79(2). Secondly, it is fair to say that the focus of the provision was on potential factual error. However, that was explained by the nature of the reform. The problem identified in the First Report of the Commissioners Inquiring into the State of the Statute Law of New South Wales (1871) was that no mechanism was available for investigating factual allegations. Thus, the Governor had no power either directly or through a justice of the peace to summon witnesses and examine them on oath. To provide such a power was the primary purpose of s 383.

36The second aspect of the history was that the establishment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 1912 provided a further mechanism for inquiry and investigation, independent of the pardoning power of the Governor and independent of the right of appeal granted by the Criminal Appeal Act itself, set out in s 26.

37The third aspect of the early history which gave some limited support for the view that s 383 was directed to matters of fact only was that there existed in the Crimes Act, as enacted in 1900, provision for reserving questions of law (ss 428 and 470) and for writs of error for reversal of judgments on conviction (s 471). In addition, s 383 had found its way into the Crimes Act as s 475 and remained there, after the other provisions were removed with the enactment of the Criminal Appeal Act. 

38The existence of these provisions supported the conclusion in Grierson that the right of appeal was confined. Thus, Rich J stated at 434:

""In making the remedies provided by sec 475 of the Crimes Act 1900 and sec 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act of 1912 available to a prisoner after conviction the legislature has, I think, recognized that the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is confined within the limits of the Act and that when the court has heard an appeal on its merits and given its decision the appeal cannot be reopened.""

39Dixon J also noted the availability of the powers conferred by s 475 and s 26, which remained exercisable at the instance of the executive, notwithstanding the dismissal of an appeal: p 437 (McTiernan J agreeing with Rich and Dixon JJ). 

40Section 26 of the Criminal Appeal Act and s 475 of the Crimes Act remained broadly in the same terms until 1993 when they were incorporated into a new Pt 13A of the Crimes Act, effective from 14 November 1993. For reasons which need not be pursued, s 474D, as enacted in 1993, permitted an application for an inquiry ""into a conviction"" to be made to the Supreme Court. Reference to a conviction may have been thought sufficient to cover conviction and sentence. However, it was construed as being limited to conviction: Application of Shepherd (unrep, Barr J, 13 September 1996). Immediately thereafter, the relevant provisions in Pt 13A were amended to include reference to ""conviction or sentence"": Crimes Amendment (Review of Convictions and Sentences) Act 1996 (NSW), effective from 27 September 1996. At that time, the structure of the provisions had settled into the form now found in Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act. One additional amendment made in 1996 introduced (as s 474A(3)) a provision in identical terms to s 74(2) set out above. 

41On one view, that provision was expansive of the scope of Pt 13A in 1996. That the 1996 amendments were intended to be expansive, so as to include inquiries into sentences, is not to be doubted: the Crown Advocate's submission was that they were not otherwise intended to expand the scope of the provisions beyond that which existed prior to the omission of the reference to sentences, which occurred in 1993. However, the new definitional provision was clear in its terms. The submissions of the Crown Advocate would simply delete it from the legislative record: for that reason, the submission cannot be accepted. There is inadequate support in the legislative and historical record for any such course, were it otherwise permissible.

Principle of finality
42It has been said that the principle of finality is ""a core value of judicial power"" (M Leeming, Authority to Decide - The Law of Jurisdiction in Australia (Federation Press, 2012) at 275) and ""[a]n inseparable feature of the rule of law"": Leeming at 276, quoting A Zuckerman ""Finality of Litigation - Setting Aside a Final Judgment"" (2008) 27 CJQ 151. However, like ""the rule of law"", it is a concept which usually operates at a high level of generality and gives rise to statements of principle which should be read in context. Thus, in D'Orta-Ekenaike v Victoria Legal Aid [2005] HCA 12; 223 CLR 1 at [34] the High Court noted that, ""[a] central and pervading tenet of the judicial system is that controversies, once resolved, are not to be reopened except in a few, narrowly defined, circumstances."". That passage was repeated in Burrell at [15], as one of three ""basic considerations"" informing the conclusion that the Court of Criminal Appeal lacked power to reopen perfected judgments.

43The importance of finality should not, however, be overstated. The joint reasons in Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531, in considering the grounds for certiorari, noted two opposing purposes and continued, at [57]:

""As Professor Sawer wrote, more than 50 years ago, the English common law courts sought to control inferior courts by 'keeping the inferior tribunal within its ""jurisdiction"" [which] may be equated with compelling the inferior tribunal to observe ""the law"", ie, what the superior tribunal considers the law to be'. Yet at the same time 'it [was] usually desired, for reasons of expediency, to give the inferior decision some degree of finality, or, as is often said, some jurisdiction to go wrong'. Those two purposes pull in opposite directions. There being this tension between them, it is unsurprising that the course of judicial decision-making in this area has not yielded principles that are always easily applied. As Sawer wrote, 'it is plain enough that the question is at bottom one of policy, not of logic'.""

44Further, noting that Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; 184 CLR 163 had rejected the proposition that reasons constituted part of the record of a court for the purposes of certiorari, the reasons in Kirk continued at [85]:

""However, the conclusion that the record of a court does not include its reasons certainly confines the availability of certiorari. Some but not all errors of law made by a court will found the grant of relief. And the availability of certiorari is confined for the stated purpose of not providing a 'discretionary general appeal for error of law'. But the need for and the desirability of effecting that purpose depend first upon there not being any other process for correction of error of law, and secondly, upon the conclusion that primacy should be given to finality rather than compelling inferior tribunals to observe the law.""

45The conflict between the demands of finality and control of both judicial and executive power were identified in the colourful language which the Court adopted with respect to privative clauses, noting that ""[t]o deprive a State Supreme Court of its supervisory jurisdiction enforcing the limits on the exercise of State executive and judicial power by persons and bodies other than that Court would be to create islands of power immune from supervision and restraint"": at [99]. 

46Thus, to talk of the principle of finality as ""an inseparable feature of the rule of law"", without referring to other principles which are also features of the rule of law may create a distorted picture. On the other hand, the supervisory jurisdiction has not been treated as a basis for intervening in the criminal jurisdiction where appeal rights exist, nor indeed, before 1912. In the present case, the Crown Advocate relied upon the principle of finality, not as some freestanding proposition which is basic to the administration of justice, but as a principle which affects the exercise of statutory interpretation. Nevertheless, its function, so far as the power to inquire is concerned, is limited. Although appeals are, on one view, an affront to the principle of finality, rights of appeal are not narrowly confined. Nor is the supervisory power confined within strict limits: rather the contrary. The history of judicial responses to privative clauses (which are the legislature's attempts to enact finality) is one of antipathy. Part 7 is inherently an exception to the principle of finality. Whether the gateway to the holding of an inquiry should be narrowly confined is a question best answered by reference to the statutory language and purpose, rather than some abstract principle, the application of which requires reconciliation with other conflicting principles.

47The administration of criminal justice is an area where Lord Atkins' aphorism, ""finality is a good thing but justice is a better"", has ready application: Ras Behari Lal v King-Emperor (1933) 50 TLR 1 at 2, identified as a possibly false dichotomy by Mason P in Multicon Engineering Pty Ltd v Federal Airports Corporation (1997) 47 NSWLR 631 at 647, but cited with approval by Bokhary PJ (albeit in dissent) in Chau Cheuk Yiu v Poon Kit Sang [2012] HKCFA 42; [2013] 1 HKC 478 at [29]. As between the State and an offender against the criminal laws, a high value is placed on fair procedure and correct outcome. At least in this area of the law, there can be no presumption against derogation from a principle of finality by a statutory scheme which has that as its primary purpose: cf Malika Holdings Pty Ltd v Stretton [2001] HCA 14; 204 CLR 290 at 298 (McHugh J). The language of s 74(2) must be given full effect.

48The Crown Advocate further invited consideration of the relationship between, on the one hand, the circumstances in which an application for an extension of time to appeal will be granted and, on the other, the consideration of an application for an inquiry under Pt 7. In Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214, Leeming JA referred to authorities which recognise that ""exceptional"" circumstances must be shown to warrant departure from the principle of finality: at [6]. The latest authority to which he referred, Chau Cheuk Yiu in the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, was not a criminal case, but involved a challenge to disciplinary proceedings which had led to a police officer being compulsorily retired (without pension entitlements) without being accorded a proper hearing. His application for review was belated because of doubt, ultimately resolved favourably to the interests of individual officers, of the application of procedural fairness requirements in the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. Nevertheless, it is true that both the minority judgment of Bokhary PJ and the majority judgment of Chan PJ drew upon applications for extension of time with respect to criminal appeals.

49The language adopted in such cases varies from case to case. A strict view was taken in England in R v Mitchell [1977] 1 WLR 753; 65 Cr App R 185, treating extensions as available only in ""a very rare case"". In R v Hawkins [1997] 1 Cr App R 234 Lord Bingham CJ considered that leave should be granted if it appeared that otherwise ""any substantial injustice"" would be done. In Alofa v Department of Labour [1980] 1 NZLR 139, Lord Cooke referred to the need for ""special circumstances"".

50The Crown Advocate argued for a similar approach to be taken in respect of applications under Pt 7, otherwise the treatment of those who had not yet appealed but needed an extension of time would give rise to anomalous results, when compared with those who had appealed, unsuccessfully, and were required to invoke the extraordinary powers under Pt 7.

51A strict test of exceptional circumstances, or the need to avoid substantial injustice, applied to applications for an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal, may well lead to different results, as compared with the language of Pt 7, requiring a judge to be satisfied that there is ""a doubt or question"" in relation to a conviction or sentence. However, the possibility of anomalous outcomes does not permit this Court to rewrite the language of s 79(2). If anomalous outcomes are to be avoided, that must be the result of the exercise of the discretionary power, and cannot be achieved by denying the existence of the power.

52History and statutory language demonstrate that the overriding purpose of Pt 7 is, consistently with the high value placed on freedom of the individual and the unwillingness to allow that liberty to be infringed because of commission of a criminal offence unless the offence has been established beyond reasonable doubt, to provide a means to address doubts as to compliance with these principles. Historically, the need for a mechanism to resolve doubts or questions as to the soundness of a conviction or sentence, so as to avoid an unremediable miscarriage of justice, called for statutory intervention. When appeals became available, that mechanism was not removed but was, indeed, improved upon and made more readily accessible.

53The fact that the gateway to an inquiry is now by seeking to satisfy a Supreme Court judge of a doubt or question as to a conviction or sentence reflects both the importance placed upon the procedure and an appropriate mechanism to ensure that it is exercised responsibly and, no doubt, sparingly. However, this mechanism militates against an unduly narrow construction of the statutory gateway.

54Further, the fact that an appeal is available as of right in respect of an error of law in respect of a conviction, but only by leave as to a matter of fact, contradicts the view that a post-appeal inquiry should be limited to questions of fact: see Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1)(a). The identification of error with respect to points of law is a function peculiarly suited to a superior court judge. The scheme by which the gateway function is conferred on the Supreme Court, rather than a justice of the peace or any other person, is inconsistent with an intention to exclude errors of law.

55Latham J considered herself bound to reject the applicant's application only by adopting a constrained view of her function which was not justified in law.

A discretionary power
56As explained above, the terms of s 79(2) constitute a condition precedent, or gateway, to the discretionary power conferred by s 79(1) on a judge of the Court. Because an unduly restrictive approach was taken to the language of s 79(2), the judge did not reach the exercise of discretion and, accordingly, no issue as to the factors which should properly be taken into account in exercising the discretionary power arises in this proceeding. However, lest it be thought that the principle of finality has limited operation in the underlying circumstances of the case, it is desirable to refer to analogous questions which have arisen in the United Kingdom.

57In Cadder v Her Majesty's Advocate [2010] UKSC 43; [2010] 1 WLR 2601, the UK Supreme Court endorsed the following passage from the judgment of Murray CJ in A v The Governor of Arbour Hill Prison [2006] 4 IR 88, which may be found in the judgment of Lord Rodger in Cadder at [101]:

""36. Judicial decisions which set a precedent in law do have retrospective effect. First of all the case which decides the point applies it retrospectively in the case being decided because obviously the wrong being remedied occurred before the case was brought. A decision in principle applies retrospectively to all persons who, prior to the decision, suffered the same or similar wrong, whether as a result of the application of an invalid statute or otherwise, provided of course they are entitled to bring proceedings seeking the remedy in accordance with the ordinary rules of law, such as a statute of limitations. It will also apply to cases pending before the courts. That is to say that a judicial decision may be relied upon in matters or cases not yet finally determined. But the retrospective effect of a judicial decision is excluded from cases already finally determined. This is the common law position.

37. Only a narrow approach based on absolute and abstract formalism could suggest that all previous cases should be capable of being reopened or relitigated (even if subject to a statute of limitations). If that absolute formalism was applied to the criminal law it would in principle suggest that every final verdict of a trial or decision of a court of appeal should be set aside or, where possible, retried in the light of subsequent decisions where such subsequent decision could be claimed to provide a potential advantage to a party in such a retrial. In principle both acquittals and convictions could be open to retrial. But one has only to pose the question to see the answer. No one has ever suggested that every time there is a judicial adjudication clarifying or interpreting the law in a particular manner which could have had some bearing on previous and finally decided cases, civil or criminal, that such cases be reopened or the decisions set aside.

38. It has not been suggested because no legal system comprehends such an absolute or complete retroactive effect of judicial decisions. To do so would render a legal system uncertain, incoherent and dysfunctional. Such consequences would cause widespread injustices.""

58Lord Rodger continued at [103]:

""The only way, therefore, in which the Court's decision in this case could have any effect on completed cases would be, indirectly, through the mechanism of such a reference by the Review Commission. It is, however, no part of this Court's function, in an appeal to which the Commission is not a party, to comment on the approach that it should adopt in handling any application for such a reference. It is for the Commission to consider where the public interest lies if an application is made to it for a reference to the High Court in a case that was properly conducted according to the law as understood at the time. A fortiori, it is no part of this Court's function on this occasion to comment on the approach to be adopted by the appeal court if the Commission should make a reference in such a case. That would be a matter for the appeal court to determine in the light of the arguments presented to it.""

59It is desirable to explain the reference to the Review Commission in this extract. The Criminal Cases Review Commission, was established by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 (UK), s 8. The Commission in effect replaced the Home Secretary as the body responsible for dealing with possible miscarriages of justice. The Commission was empowered by s 9 ""at any time"" to refer a conviction or a sentence to the Court of Appeal, where it would be treated for all purposes as an appeal by the person under the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 (UK). The conditions for exercise of the power to refer a case are set out in s 13 of the 1995 Act, which provides:

13(1) A reference of a conviction, verdict, finding or sentence shall not be made under any of sections 9 to 12 unless - 

(a) the Commission consider that there is a real possibility that the conviction, verdict, finding or sentence would not be upheld were the reference to be made,

(b) the Commission so consider -

(i) in the case of a conviction, verdict or finding, because of an argument, or evidence, not raised in the proceedings which led to it or on any appeal or application for leave to appeal against it, or
(ii) in the case of a sentence, because of an argument on a point of law, or information, not so raised, and

(c) an appeal against the conviction, verdict, finding or sentence has been determined or leave to appeal against it has been refused.

(2) Nothing in subsection (1)(b)(i) or (c) shall prevent the making of a reference if it appears to the Commission that there are exceptional circumstances which justify making it.

60In 2007, the Court of Appeal became concerned that the approach of the Commission with respect to what were described as ""change of law cases"" did not take account of the restricted view adopted by the Court with respect to cases requiring an extension of time. The concern arose because, once a referral was made, that gateway would not arise as the case was required to be dealt with as an appeal: see R v Cottrell & Fletcher [2007] EWCA Crim 2016; [2007] 1 WLR 3262 (Sir Igor Judge P, Golding and Beatson JJ) at [42]-[58]. The Court noted at [46]:

""... it has been for very many years, and still is, as Hughes LJ described it in R v Ramzan [2007] 1 CAR 150, the 'very well established practice of this court, in a case where the conviction was entirely proper under the law as it stood at the time of trial, to grant leave to appeal against conviction out of time only where substantial injustice would otherwise be done to the defendant.' In short, the principle is that the defendant seeking leave to appeal out of time is generally expected to point to something more than the mere fact that the criminal law has changed, or been corrected, or developed. If the appeal is effectively based on a change of law, and nothing else, but the conviction was properly returned at the time, after a fair trial, it is unlikely that a substantial injustice occurred.""

61The reasoning in this regard concluded at [58] with the following statement:

""In our judgment, in these cases, it is not open to the Commission lawfully to apply a policy based on the conclusion of the divisional court that it was 'under no obligation to have regard to, still less to implement' the practice of the court. The practice must be addressed and evaluated in every case. Just as the court will not normally extend time, a conviction should not normally be referred on the basis of a change of law. We repeat paragraph 46 of this judgment. In the final analysis, however, provided the Commission addresses and gives proper weight to the law and practice of the court, it must exercise its own independent and fact-specific judgment whether to refer a case.""

62It is not necessary to consider in this case to what extent those remarks would apply to the consideration given by a judge of the Supreme Court under s 79(1)(b), or to the somewhat different process available under paragraph (a). It may, however, be noted that the approach adopted in R v Cottrell & Fletcher remains authoritative in the UK: Mohid Jawad v The Queen [2013] EWCA Crim 644 at [29] ( Hughes LJ).

Available relief
63In the event that his submissions were upheld, the applicant sought both mandatory and declaratory orders. The mandatory orders included an order quashing the decision refusing the application and an order directing Latham J to perform her obligation to determine the applicant's application according to law.

64The declaratory orders sought were twofold. First, a declaration was sought that ""the adverse consequences flowing to the applicant from the application of sentencing principles found to be wrong in [Muldrock] are capable of raising a doubt or question within the meaning of s 79(2) of the [Appeal and Review Act]"". A further declaration was sought that ""the material before this Court as to the applicant's state of mind concerning his grievance as an offender sentenced in an adverse way according to principles found to be wrong in Muldrock is capable of raising a doubt or question within the meaning of s 79(2) of the [Appeal and Review Act]"". Reliance on the subjective beliefs of the offender was misplaced: they are neither necessary nor sufficient to raise a doubt or question. The matter appears to have been presented in that way on the basis that such evidence may constitute part of the ""available material"", which might cause a judge ""for want of a better word 'unease' in allowing a conviction to stand"": Varley v Attorney General (NSW) (1987) 8 NSWLR 30 at 48, referring to language used by Nagle CJ at CL in an earlier matter (unreported) involving the same offender.

65This language does not assist. There is no purpose served by adopting other words than the statutory language of ""doubt or question"". The ""material"" on which the judge may base an opinion is not improved or added to by a document setting out the subjective beliefs of the applicant. Nor is it necessary for the applicant to demonstrate subjective grievance, to establish an appropriate basis for seeking an inquiry. The form of the second proposed declaration is inapt.

66Whether the rules regarding the writ of certiorari would have permitted its issue in the circumstances of the present case may be doubted. The refusal of the application for an inquiry did not preclude a further application, although, if a further application were made on the same grounds, it might well be refused simply on the basis that the complaint had previously been dealt with, pursuant to s 79(3)(a)(ii), which reflects a general principle which would operate absent any statutory basis. As explained in Aronson and Groves, Judicial Review of Administrative Action (5th ed, 2013) at 12.14 (pp 795-798), there is uncertainty as to the type of interest which might be protected by certiorari. There is a further question as to whether the limits as to the availability of the writ confine the power of this Court to make a quashing order pursuant to powers conferred by s 69 and, perhaps, s 23 of the Supreme Court Act.

67There is also a question whether a quashing order is either necessary or appropriate in circumstances where the Court would not grant mandamus. As noted in Plaintiff M61/2010E v The Commonwealth [2010] HCA 41; 243 CLR 319 at [100], ""the unavailability of mandamus entails that there is no utility in granting certiorari to quash the recommendation"". This statement, and remarks to similar effect in Re Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs; Ex parte Applicants S134/2002 [2003] HCA 1; 211 CLR 441 at [48], were made in relation to an application which the Minister had no obligation to consider and in respect of relief sought under s 75(v) of the Constitution, where certiorari is granted only where necessary to give effect to relief available under that section. Again, the jurisdiction exercised by this Court differs from that conferred on the High Court under s 75(v), both in its substance and its form. 

68Nevertheless, as senior counsel for the applicant was inclined to concede, there is no need to grant a mandatory order in the present case. First, if it were granted, it would not be directed to a particular judge of the Court. Secondly, the suggestion that the Court of Appeal (which is part of the Supreme Court) would grant an order directed to ""the Supreme Court"", ordering it to take particular steps is such as to cast doubt on the availability of the remedy. Indeed, such a course would be inconsistent with the historical understanding as to the availability of the writ, described by Brennan CJ in Re Jarman; Ex parte Cook (No 1) [1997] HCA 13; 188 CLR 595 at 604:

""The writ of mandamus is a supervisory remedy, issuing to an officer subordinate to the jurisdiction of a superior court having jurisdiction to issue the writ, commanding the performance of a public duty which, in the opinion of the superior court, the officer has wrongly refused to perform. A Judge of the Industrial Relations Court is not an officer subordinate to the jurisdiction of that Court. Nor could that Court form an opinion that a Judge had wrongly failed to exercise its jurisdiction when the decision of that Judge had the effect of a Court decision that there was no such jurisdiction to exercise.""

69To similar effect, in Kirk at [98], the joint reasons stated:

""The supervisory jurisdiction of the Supreme Courts was at federation, and remains, the mechanism for the determination and the enforcement of the limits on the exercise of State executive and judicial power by persons and bodies other than the Supreme Court.""

70From that proposition it may be assumed that no constitutional constraint would deny the power of a State Parliament to regulate or limit the scope of relief available in its Supreme Court, with respect to judges of that Court. However, there may be some doubt as to the correctness of that proposition. In Wainohu v State of New South Wales [2011] HCA 24; 243 CLR 181, the High Court considered the validity of the Crimes (Criminal Organisations Control) Act 2009 (NSW), which permitted the Commissioner of Police to apply to a judge of the Supreme Court for a declaration if satisfied that members of a specified organisation associated for the purpose of (in short) engaging in serious criminal activity. The function exercised by the judge in that respect was described as ""an administrative, not a judicial act"": at [1] (French CJ and Kiefel J). The validity of the legislation was challenged on the basis that the conferral of such a power on a judge of the Supreme Court constituted an intrusion upon the institutional integrity of the Court and was thus invalid because it was beyond the power of the State Parliament to legislate in a manner inconsistent with Ch 3 of the Constitution. Critical to the conclusion that the Act was invalid was the removal by s 13(2) of any obligation on the judge to give reasons for his or her declaration, as explained by Hayne, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ in Assistant Commissioner Michael James Condon v Pompano Pty Ltd [2013] HCA 7; 87 ALJR 458 at [135].

71The Act also contained a privative clause which purported to preclude any review of a declaration made under Pt 2, to be found in s 35 of the impugned legislation. (There was a right of appeal ""in relation to the making of a control order"" - s 24 - but it appears to have been assumed that such an appeal would not extend to the validity of the declaration, although the declaration was a precondition to the making of a control order.) French CJ and Kiefel J stated that it was ""not in dispute"", that the privative clause was required to be read so as not to exclude review for jurisdictional error, referring to the passage in Kirk at [98]-[99], part of which is set out above. The joint reasons of Gummow, Hayne, Crennan and Bell JJ stated at [89]:

""Section 35 of the Act purports to exclude the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in respect of judicial review of declarations made by an eligible Judge under Pt 2. The effectiveness of that exclusion is denied by the decision in Kirk v Industrial Court (NSW).""

72The decision in Kirk concerned a privative clause operating with respect to the Industrial Court, not the Supreme Court and, in particular, the exercise of judicial functions by that Court, not administrative functions. The applicant in the present case relied upon the statement in Wainohu as a basis for concluding that, although no privative clause affects Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act, this Court must have a constitutionally protected jurisdiction to review decisions of its own judges in the exercise of an administrative function. However, the validity of s 35 of the legislation under consideration in Wainohu was not a basis for the determination of invalidity, nor was its effect the subject of dispute. In those circumstances, it is preferable that this Court, if not required to deal with the issue, await further explication of the scope of the statements in Wainohu by the High Court.

73One further matter should be noted. In order to demonstrate the error in the approach adopted by Latham J, it was necessary for the applicant to rely upon the reasons given for the refusal of the application. The applicant submitted that those reasons demonstrated either a jurisdictional error or an error of law on the face of the record.

74If the error involved the misconstruction of legislation by a judge of the Supreme Court in the exercise of a judicial function, there is good reason to doubt that it would constitute ""jurisdictional error"", as it would be within the undoubted power of the judge to determine for herself the law to be applied. On that view, the allegation of jurisdictional error depended upon the characterisation of the function as administrative, or at least ""not judicial"", in the language of s 79(4).

75Uncertainty exists as to the basis for identifying error of law on the face of the record. In Craig, the Court held that reasons did not form part of the record of a court or tribunal, unless expressly incorporated by the decision-maker. Section 69(3) of the Supreme Court Act reversed that principle for the purpose of this Court's supervisory jurisdiction, by declaring that the record includes ""the reasons expressed by the court or tribunal for its ultimate determination"": s 69(4). There is a question, not addressed by the parties in their submissions, as to whether a judge exercising an administrative function (if that be the correct characterisation) constitutes a ""court or tribunal"", each of which usually describes a body exercising judicial, or perhaps quasi-judicial, functions.

76Given the absence of attention to any of these issues, and given the inappropriateness of an order of mandamus and the absence of need for an order setting aside or quashing the refusal of the application, it is undesirable to seek to resolve these questions. Rather, it is appropriate to make a declaration, as permitted by s 65 of the Supreme Court Act, in the terms of the first declaration proposed by the applicant, based on a finding of error of law.

77It follows from such a finding that the application made by the applicant for an inquiry under Pt 7 of the Appeal and Review Act has not yet been determined according to law. There is no reason to suppose that the Supreme Court is precluded from further consideration of the application. Although it is implicit that an application under s 78 is to be in writing (the Registrar must cause a ""copy"" of it to be given to the Minister) there is no form or formality involved. If it were thought to have been finally disposed of by the refusal on 17 September 2013, it could no doubt be reactivated by a letter incorporating the material already provided. Accordingly, no formal direction is required in order to ensure that the matter is determined according to law.

Orders
78The parties indicated that they had an agreement as to costs and no order was required, whatever the outcome of the proceeding in this Court.

79The form of the declaration should take account of the fact that Latham J was persuaded that the sentencing judge and Court of Criminal Appeal had applied sentencing principles which should not have been applied in the light of the High Court's judgment in Muldrock: at [9]. Both courts approached the sentencing exercise on an erroneous view of the law. That was an error capable of giving rise to a doubt or question as to the correctness of the sentence imposed. The court should make a declaration in the following terms:

Declare that an error of law on the part of the sentencing judge and, on appeal, the Court of Criminal Appeal, which may have caused a sentence to be imposed of greater severity than would otherwise have been the case, constitutes an aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the sentence which may form the basis of a doubt or question as to circumstances having the potential to mitigate the sentence imposed, for the purpose of considering an application for an inquiry under s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW).

80PRICE J: I agree with the reasons of Basten JA and the terms of the declaration that his Honour proposes. I only wish to add a few words as to the meaning of ""any mitigating circumstances"" in s 79(2). In my opinion, the applicant's submission that these words mean ""anything that might lessen the sentence in law"" is to be accepted. The reality of the trial judge's adherence in the present case to the guidance of Way was that the applicant's subjective circumstances were given less weight than they would otherwise have been if the applicant had been sentenced in accordance with the principles in Muldrock. This is evident from the trial judge's sentencing remarks (JOS 10): 

""When dealing with offences after trial for which a standard non-parole period applies, there must be an appropriate relationship between that period and the objective criminality of the offence regardless of the other matters that may be taken into account by way of mitigation"". 

81I also agree with the additional remarks of Beech-Jones J.

82BEECH-JONES J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Basten JA in draft form. Subject to what follows I agree with his Honour.

83First, in addition to those matters discussed by Basten JA, there is in my view a further aspect of the statutory scheme created by Part 7 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 that supports the applicant's argument. His Honour has extracted the relevant provisions of Division 3 (at [15]) and the relevant part of s 74(2) (at [18]). In the case of an application for review made to the Supreme Court, if the Court is satisfied of the matter set out in s 79(2) and no discretionary reason for the refusal of the application is apparent (s 79(3)), the Court can either direct an inquiry by a judicial officer or refer the ""whole case"" to the Court of Criminal Appeal (s 79(1)). Of course an error of law in the sentencing process is a matter that can be addressed on a referral of the ""whole case"" to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

84Otherwise the conduct of an inquiry ordered under s 79(1) is governed by Division 4 of Part 7. Section 82 deals with the action that is to be taken on completion of such an inquiry. It provides:

""Action to be taken on completion of inquiry

(1) On completing an inquiry under this Division, the judicial officer must cause a report on the results of the inquiry (incorporating a transcript of the depositions given in the course of the inquiry) to be sent to:

(a) the Governor, in the case of an inquiry held on the direction of the Governor, or

(b) the Chief Justice, in the case of an inquiry held on the direction of the Supreme Court.

(2) The judicial officer may also refer the matter (together with a copy of the report) to the Court of Criminal Appeal:

(a) for consideration of the question of whether the conviction should be quashed (in any case in which the judicial officer is of the opinion that there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the convicted person), or

(b) for review of the sentence imposed on the convicted person (in any case in which the judicial officer is of the opinion that there is a reasonable doubt as to any matter that may have affected the nature or severity of the sentence).

(3) After considering a report furnished to the Chief Justice under this section, the Supreme Court must cause its own report on the matter (together with a copy of the judicial officer's report) to be sent to the Governor.

(4) The Governor may then dispose of the matter in such manner as to the Governor appears just."" (emphasis added)

85There is no doubt that if, following an inquiry, a judicial officer considered that there was a reasonable basis for believing that a sentence was rendered more severe than it otherwise would have been by reason of an error of law then they would hold a ""reasonable doubt as to [a] matter that may have affected the ... severity of the sentence"" within the meaning of s 82(2)(b) and could refer the ""matter"" to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

86In my view it follows that, if the respondent's contention that an error of law in the sentencing process which affected the severity of the sentence is not capable of satisfying s 79(2) was accepted, the outcome would be counter-intuitive to say the least. Part 7 creates a statutory scheme which enables persons to apply for an inquiry into their sentence (s 78(1)), including an inquiry which concerns ""any aspect of the proceedings giving rise to the ... sentence"" (s 74(2)). This can include an error of law affecting the sentence. If the application is granted, the applicant may either have the whole case referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal (s 79(1)(b)) which can address any error of law affecting the sentence, or the applicant could obtain an inquiry which could also lead to a referral to the Court of Criminal because of a possible error of law affecting the sentence (s 79(1)(a) and s 82(2)(b)). Yet, according to the respondent's argument, unless there is some doubt or question as to a factual matter affecting a sentence, all these means of redressing errors of law that appear to be proffered by the statutory scheme would be frustrated because the threshold created by s 79(2) could not be overcome.

87Second, as noted by Basten JA at [11], this case does not involve a ""change in the law"". Instead it only concerns a sentence in respect of which there is clearly a ""doubt or question"" as to the sentence arising from an error of law in the sentencing process. In the ordinary course a true change in the law will only be effected by the legislature and only have prospective effect. Such a change will usually have nothing to say about whether there is a relevant doubt or question as to the severity of a sentence imposed prior to the change. A doubt or question, as referred to in s 79(2), can only be one in which there is some utility in having an inquiry or a referral to the Court of Criminal Appeal.

88Third, one matter raised during the appeal concerned the appropriate form of relief that may be granted if the applicant's contention that Latham J erroneously construed s 79(2) was accepted. In the end result Senior Counsel for the applicant indicated that his client was content with declaratory relief as the purpose of the proceedings was to ventilate and resolve a question concerning the proper construction of s 79(2) and it would be open to his client to apply under Part 7 again. For that reason I join in the declaration proposed by Basten JA. I express no view on the availability or otherwise of an order in the nature of certiorari in respect of a decision under s 79(2) to refuse an inquiry.

2705857,R v Wilson (No 3) [2013] NSWSC 1684,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: On 9 September 2013 the accused was found by Johnson J to be unfit to be tried for the offences of the murder of Scott Daniel Bryan on 24 November 2008, of soliciting Gerard Michael Wilson between 29 January 2010 and 7 February 2010 to murder Krystelle Lee Collins and between 15 December 2009 and 6 February 2010 of committing an act intended to cause Krystelle Lee Collins to give false evidence: see R v Wilson (No 1) [2013] NSWSC 1146; R v Wilson (No 2) [2013] NSWSC 1288. In accordance with s 30(2)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 his Honour directed that a special hearing be conducted. Commencing on 4 November 2013 at Nowra, the accused came before me upon a special hearing pursuant to s 19 of that Act. 

2Sections 19, 21 and 22 of the Act provide relevantly as follows:

""19 Court to hold special hearing after advice received from Director of Public Prosecutions

(1) If the Court receives a notification of a determination from the Tribunal under section 16 (3), 45 (3) or 47 (5) that a person will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for an offence, the Court: 

(a) is to obtain the advice of the Director of Public Prosecutions as to whether further proceedings will be taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of the offence, and 

(b) is to conduct a special hearing as soon as practicable unless the Director of Public Prosecutions advises that no further proceedings will be taken. 

(2) A special hearing is a hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged. 

21 Nature and conduct of special hearing 
(1) Except as provided by this Act, a special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings. 

(2) At a special hearing, the accused person must, unless the Court otherwise allows, be represented by an Australian legal practitioner and the fact that the person has been found unfit to be tried for an offence is to be presumed not to be an impediment to the person's representation. 

(3) At a special hearing: 

(a) the accused person is to be taken to have pleaded not guilty in respect of the offence charged, and 

(b) the Australian legal practitioner, if any, who represents the accused person may exercise the rights of the person to challenge jurors or the jury, and 

(c) without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the accused person may raise any defence that could be properly raised if the special hearing were an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings, and 

(d) without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the accused person is entitled to give evidence.

22 Verdicts at special hearing 

(1) The verdicts available to the jury or the Court at a special hearing include the following: 

(a) not guilty of the offence charged, 

(b) not guilty on the ground of mental illness, 

(c) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed the offence charged, 

(d) that on the limited evidence available, the accused person committed an offence available as an alternative to the offence charged. 

(2) A verdict in accordance with subsection (1) (b) is to be taken to be equivalent for all purposes to a special verdict that an accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness under section 38. 

(3) A verdict in accordance with subsection (1) (c) or (d): 

(a) constitutes a qualified finding of guilt and does not constitute a basis in law for any conviction for the offence to which the finding relates, and 

(b) subject to section 28, constitutes a bar to further prosecution in respect of the same circumstances, and 

(c) is subject to appeal in the same manner as a verdict in an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings, and

(d) is to be taken to be a conviction for the purpose of enabling a victim of the offence in respect of which the verdict is given to make a claim for compensation."" 

3The procedures for a special hearing were considered in R v Zvonaric [2001] NSWCCA 505; (2001) 54 NSWLR 1. A special hearing should be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial, including a formal arraignment and the proper reception of evidence: s 21(1) of the Act. Although the practice is not to be encouraged, the tendering of statements that are not read aloud during a special hearing does not infringe the section. A trial judge should expose his or her reasons for the findings that are made in respect of the elements of the offence.

Background

4The facts, which I find beyond reasonable doubt, are relevantly as follows.

Count 1 on the indictment

5The deceased and the accused had been friends for a number of years prior to November 2008. They were both being treated for severe mental illness and were chronic cannabis users.

6The accused regularly smoked cannabis with the deceased at his home. The deceased lived what appears to have been a semi-reclusive life in a Department of Housing apartment in Short Street, Batemans Bay. He was not employed and was medicated for treatment of his mental illness. He also required daily medication for treatment of a blood disease. The deceased was unable to walk any distance because of the effect of that condition upon his legs.

7The accused lived alone in rented premises on acreage off McCardy's Creek Road, Nelligen. He was at that time in a long-term relationship with Krystelle Collins. She regularly spent the night there with the accused and her young daughter. 

8Aaron Kirchner lived with his mother in the Batemans Bay area. He was employed by the accused to assist him in his lawn mowing business

9The deceased was reported missing to the Batemans Bay police by a mental health worker on 5 December 2008. Police attended the deceased's premises that afternoon but found the apartment secure and undisturbed. The deceased's wallet, a set of keys to the premises and his medication were located in the kitchen. There was no sign of any struggle or other disturbance having taken place within the premises. Nothing indicated foul play or suggested the intended long-term absence of the deceased. A return visit by the police a week later revealed that nothing had changed.

10On 27 February 2009 the accused was taken into custody on unrelated matters. Police visited the accused on 9 April 2009 at Goulburn Gaol where he was interviewed. He confirmed his association with the deceased but denied any knowledge of or involvement in his disappearance.

11On 27 May 2009 Krystelle Collins provided a statement to the police. She alleged that on the evening of 24 November 2008 the accused told her that earlier that day, he and Mr Kirchner had driven the deceased from his apartment to a bush location near Nelligen, close to where the accused then lived. The accused told Ms Collins that he had shot the deceased twice and killed him. The first shot contained scatter, or shot, and merely rendered the deceased unconscious. The second shot was with a solid round fired to the back of the deceased's head. Ms Collins alleged that the accused asked her to assist him to bury the body of the deceased but she declined. The accused later told her that he and Mr Kirchner buried the deceased in a shallow grave in bushland in the early hours of the following morning. The accused told Ms Collins that a piece of the deceased's clothing was left protruding from the ground.

12Ms Collins also told the police that the accused had confided in her a number of times in the week prior to his disappearance that he intended to kill the deceased. The accused said that he was angry with the deceased because he had repeatedly stolen money from the accused and failed to pay him for cannabis that he supplied. The accused also previously described to Ms Collins how he proposed to kill the deceased. She alleges that he said he was going to take the deceased out into the bush next time they went to check on the cannabis plants and shoot him.

13In due course police discovered the body of the deceased on 23 June 2009. A large-scale search of the Currowan area off McCardy's Creek Road, Nelligen using cadaver dogs located his body in a thickly vegetated and heavily timbered area at a site near a creek bed off Blitz Road. The deceased's boot and dark coloured shirt were seen to be protruding from the soil. The direct cause of death was established following an autopsy to have been a gunshot wound to the back of the head.

14On 30 June 2009 Mr Kirchner participated in an electronically recorded interview in which he denied any knowledge of or involvement in the death of the deceased. However, on 23 April 2010 Mr Kirchner was arrested in Queensland and subsequently participated in another electronically recorded interview. He made admissions that he was present when the deceased was killed. He maintained that the accused killed the deceased but that he had no involvement in the death of the deceased or in burying his body. He assisted police in a re-enactment of what took place at the scene. Mr Kirchner was later charged with the murder of the deceased. He pleaded guilty to murder on the basis that he aided and abetted the accused. Mr Kirchner was sentenced upon the basis that he would give evidence in these proceedings and received a discount for doing so.

Further analysis

15It is necessary for present purposes to consider more closely some of the evidence that underpins the Crown case with respect to the first count on the indictment.

Ms Collins' evidence

16Ms Collins was asked to recall whether the accused ever spoke to her about the deceased. She gave this evidence:

""Q. Did Mr Wilson ever talk to you about any issues he had with Mr Bryan? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did he tell you? 
A. He would whinge to me about him stealing money out of his wallet, helping himself supposedly to the crops, taking buds for himself. 

Q. This was Mr Wilson telling you what Mr Bryan was doing? 
A. What Scott was doing, yes. 

Q. Can you recall any words that he used on any occasions he spoke to you about these problems he had with Mr Bryan? 
A. He used to say he wanted to knock him off. 

Q. Do you recall the month of November 2008? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And a period before Mr Bryan went missing, do you recall any conversation in particular you had with Mr Wilson about Mr Bryan? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Where did that conversation take place? 
A. We actually had a couple of conversations. It would have been in his ute at his house, at McCardy's Creek Road. 

Q. What did Mr Wilson say to you on those occasions about Mr Bryan? 
A. He'd say, 'Next time I go out to the bush with him I'm going to shoot him'. 

Q. Did you say anything in response to that? 
A. Yes, I used to say to him, 'Don't be stupid, just leave him alone, don't hang around him' or, 'If you're going to do anything, just leave him out in the bush to walk home'. 

Q. That is leave Mr Bryan out in the bush to walk home? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Do you recall if Mr Wilson responded to that when you said that to him? 
A. Well he never really responded to it; he would just listen, take it in. 

Q. And those conversations that you have just given evidence of, they occurred approximately when? 
A. A few months prior to November 2008.""

17On 24 November 2008, Ms Collins had some difficulty contacting the accused. There is significant and uncontested evidence that she attempted unsuccessfully to speak to him by phone throughout that day. It was not until approximately 6.00pm or thereabouts that she finally contacted him. She was asked about that:

""Q. When you spoke to Mr Wilson what did he say? 
A. I asked him what he had been doing and he said that him and Aaron were out at his place fixing a broken window in his ute. 

Q. Who was Aaron? 
A. Aaron was a friend.

Q. Was that a person who worked with Joe in the lawn mowing business? 
A. Yes, he did work with him sometimes, yes. 

Q. He was an employee? 
A. Yes. 

Q. He said he was fixing a window in his car? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Did he say where he was at that time? 
A. At his place at Nelligen. 

Q. When did you next see Joe after that phone call? 
A. He came in around about 7, 7.30, to pick me and my daughter up. 

Q. And he came to your place at 23 Matthew Parade? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What vehicle was he in? 
A. He was in his ute. 

Q. A blue Nissan ute? 
A. Yes. 

Q. How old was your daughter at that stage, 2008? 
A. 5, 6. 

Q. Where did you go from your home? 
A. We drove out to his property at Nelligen.""

18The accused drove Ms Collins and her daughter to the property. She was asked about what then happened:

""Q. After your daughter went to bed was there any conversation between Joe Wilson and yourself? 
A. Yes. 

Q. As best you can recall, using first person terms, can you say what was said and by whom please? 
A. I asked Joe what was he doing all day, as I was quite annoyed, and Joe said, 'I was with Aaron' after they'd done a couple of lawns. First off he said to me, 'If I tell you something don't go off your head'. He said, 'Sit down and I'll tell you' and I was sitting down. 

Q. In the lounge room? 
A. Yes. He was sitting at his desk and he said to me, 'Me and Aaron done some lawns this morning, then we went and got a smoke'. They went halves in $50 worth of marijuana and they went to Scott's place in Short Street to have a smoke. Once they had a smoke they left from there and then he realised that they left some pot there. So he said he went back there to get it. Scott was stoned and Joe and Aaron got cranky because they asked him where was the pot and Scott said, 'I don't know where it is, you must have took it' and he said that him and Aaron got cranky and he said, 'Let's go and check out on a crop'. 

Q. Who said that? 
A. Joe. Then he said they got in the car and drove out to Nelligen. He said Scott got out of the car and walked out in front and he said, 'I shot him in the back of the head'. 

Q. Did he say approximately what time this had happened?
A. I asked him a few questions. I said, 'What time?' Because at a certain time I had a really bad feeling in my gut. He said, '5.30pm'. 

Q. Do you recall if Mr Wilson told you anything more about what happened? 
A. Well I did ask a few questions because I just wanted him to say to me that he was joking and I asked him, 'Where did you put him?' and he said, 'He's laying up in the bush' and I asked him, 'How many times did you shoot him?' and he said, 'I shot him once in the back of the head and then Aaron was yelling at me to shoot him again' and I said, 'Why?' and he said, 'Because the first bullet just knocked him out, it was a scatter bullet' and he said, 'I shot him with a solid'. Then he said he took off, they took off and ran back to the car. 

Q. How were you feeling when Joe was telling you this? 
A. I felt sick and angry. 

Q. When you say you felt sick? 
A. I had to go to the toilet and I had a bit of a spew and I it didn't quite hit me straight away. 

Q. Did he ask you for anything? 
A. Well he said to me, 'I've got to go bury him. Will you come and help me?' 

Q. What did you say when he asked you that? 
A. I said 'no'. 

Q. How long did that whole conversation take? 
A. 10, 15 minutes maybe. 

Q. Did you stay out at Nelligen that night? 
A. Yes. 

Q. Why did you do that? 
A. Well I have no other way of getting home. I wasn't thinking straight, I just stayed there."" 

19There then followed Ms Collins' description of what occurred next:

""Q. Early the following morning did something happen? 
A. Joe told me that night that, because I wasn't go help him, he needed to pick Aaron up in town, which was at Surf Beach, and go out to where they'd shot him and dig a grave and put him in it and it sort of didn't really hit me until I woke up at 3am in the morning and he was reversing out of the driveway in his ute to go do what he said he was going to do. 

Q. Did the ute then leave? 
A. Yes. 

Q. When was the next time you saw Joe after the ute took off? 
A. He arrived back home about 6, 7am. 

Q. Did he say anything when he arrived back? 
A. He wasn't feeling well. He was back and forwards to the toilet. 

Q. What was he doing there, do you know? 
A. Well I think he had diarrhoea. 

Q. Did he say what had happened? 
A. Well, I said to him, 'What have you been doing?' He said, 'I went and picked Aaron up. I went out. We started digging a hole and Aaron had to finish it because he was spewing'. Joe said he was spewing because it smelt. And he said, 'Aaron had to put him in a hole and cover him up'. 

Q. Did you ask any questions or say anything to Mr Wilson when he told you this? 
A. I asked him, how far down the road he is and he said, 'He's down there far enough.' I said, 'How far off the road is he?' And he said, 'He's off far enough.' And I said, 'Did you bury him properly?' And he said, 'No, you could still see some clothing'. 

Q. How were you feeling when he was telling you this? 
A. Angry and upset. 

Q. How was Joe, what did he appear like from the time he was telling you this? 
A. He was fine. He was just pale. 

Q. Following that conversation that would have been in the early hours of 25 November? 
A. Yes.""

20Finally in this context Ms Collins gave the following evidence:

""Q. Ms Collins, at any stage did you ask Mr Wilson why he had shot Scott? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did he say? 
A. He said because he was sick of him stealing and lying to him. 

Q. Him stealing what? 
A. Money and marijuana. 

Q. Did he make any reference as to whereabouts Scott's body was? 
A. He said it was the road off McCardy's Creek Road, up that road. 

Q. Did you have some knowledge of that area from the times you had been staying out at Mr Wilson's property? Did you have some idea of where that was? 
A. Yes, I knew what road he was referring to."" 

21Following these events, Ms Collins continued, as she had for some time beforehand, to spend time living at the accused's property at Nelligen. However, in February 2009 Ms Collins moved back permanently to live in premises in Batehaven. As appears elsewhere in these reasons, the accused was taken into custody on unrelated matters on 27 February 2009.

Mr Kirchner's evidence

22Aaron Kirchner gave evidence by video link from Goulburn Gaol. Schmidt J sentenced him on 9 December 2011 to a term of imprisonment, he having previously pleaded guilty to the murder of the deceased on the first day of his trial on 19 October 2011. He received a discount of 45 percent for the combined effect of his plea and his promise to give evidence for the Crown in these proceedings. He was sentenced to a non-parole term of 6 years, which is due to expire on 22 April 2016: see R v Kirchner [2011] NSWSC 1516.

23It is necessary in assessing Mr Kirchner's evidence that I have regard to the fact that he is to be treated as a witness who might reasonably be supposed to have been criminally concerned in the events giving rise to the proceeding. He is a witness who, in the particular circumstances of this case, is liable to lose the benefit of the reduction in his sentence to which I have referred if he failed to give evidence that he undertook to give and upon which undertaking Schmidt J relied when sentencing him and in formulating the discount concerned. I have notionally directed myself that Mr Kirchner's evidence may be unreliable for these reasons and that I should have regard to that fact in considering the manner in which I should take account of his evidence and the weight that I should give it.

24Mr Kirchner first met the accused in about 2006. In approximately March 2008 he commenced to work for him in his lawn mowing business in and around the Batemans Bay area. He said that at that time both he and the accused were smoking cannabis regularly. He had accompanied the accused in September 2008 when the accused went to Mogo to purchase a .22 rifle and a 410 shotgun from John Weston.

25Mr Kirchner had met the deceased prior to 24 November 2008 but said that he did not know him. On that day he attended the deceased's premises with the accused where they all smoked cannabis. The accused and Mr Kirchner then left to mow some lawns but they later returned. Mr Kirchner gave the following evidence:

""Q. After you mowed those lawns what did you do? 
A. Joe said something about hitting on some dope plants. We went back to Scott Bryan's place, picked him up and went out into the bush and that was where he got shot.""

26Mr Kirchner said that the accused had been ranting about the deceased that day but that he did not pay much attention to what he was saying. He said that they drove from the deceased's house out to the accused's property where he dropped them off some distance from his house. The accused then drove to the house without them but returned about ten minutes later. He then gave the following evidence:

""Q. When he came back what happened then? 
A. We got in the ute and he took us out to at the time it was an unmarked road a bit further up from his place and stopped near a bridge that was falling over or a collapsing bridge and, yeah, told us that up the creek some way he had a crop growing and just follow the creek bed up a bit further. 

Q. What did you do when you got out of the vehicle, where did you go? 
A. Stood around the ute for a moment, had a cigarette and waited for those two to sort themselves out and Joey came out with a shotgun and he said it was up that way. 

Q. Where did the shotgun come from? 
A. I believe it was behind the back seat of the ute.""

27They then set off walking. He described what happened in the following evidence:

""Q. Were you walking side by side or one ahead of the other, what was the order of your walking? 
A. Scott was in front followed by Joe, I was behind Joe. 

Q. Approximately how far did you walk along this creek? 
A. 50, 60 metres maybe. 

Q. You said Joe had a shotgun, can you describe it, what style it was? 
A. Fairly small. Had cocking levers on it, I believe they are. Old. It wasn't particularly well maintained. 

Q. You gave evidence earlier of being at Mogo on an occasion when Weston was there? 
A. Yes. 

Q. You gave evidence that after that you saw two guns, one was a shotgun? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What's your belief as to what gun was being held by Joe Wilson on this occasion after you got out of the ute? 
A. I believe it was the same shotgun. 

Q. You just explain the next thing. You said you were walking along in the bush, what's the next thing you recall happening? 
A. I recall the shotgun going off. Scott's hat flying off and falling forward and I turned and bolted. 

Q. As you bolted which way did you bolt? 
A. Back towards the ute. 

Q. Did you hear anything when you turned around and bolted? 
A. Yeah, I heard a second shot after the after the first one. It would have been 20 metres away from me, maybe. 

Q. Did you get back to the ute? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What did you do when you got to the ute? 
A. I looked for Wilson's keys. 

Q. Were the keys in the ute? 
A. No. 

Q. How were you feeling at that stage? 
A. Horrified.""

28The accused returned shortly after that and put the shotgun behind the driver's seat in the ute. He said, ""Let's go"" and they drove off along Blitz Road. After a short while the accused stopped. Mr Kirchner said what happened:

""Q. Before you got to McCardy's Creek Road back to the intersection of that road, did the ute stop at any stage? 
A. Yes. 

Q. What happened when the ute stopped? 
A. Joe took something, around about a metre long, give or take, wrapped in a black plastic bag and dropped behind some fallen trees. 

Q. Do you know what was in that bag? 
A. No. I presumed it was a shotgun. 

Q. Where did you go from that point? 
A. Joe took me straight home.""

29Mr Kirchner then gave the following evidence about what happened the next day:

""Q. What's the next occasion you saw Mr Wilson? 
A. The next morning. 

Q. Approximately what time would that have been? 
A. Around about 5.30. 

Q. Where did you see him? 
A. At home. 

Q. What happened when he came to your home about that time? 
A. He woke me up. I went down, I went downstairs. Got out of bed. I went out and, yeah, he said, 'Time to bury him'. We got in his ute and went back out there. 

Q. When you got to the location where the body was, what did you do? 
A. We dug a hole, approximately about 30 centimetres deep. Joe at that point said, 'It's around about enough'. And I grabbed hold his mid section and Joe grabbed hold of his shoulders and we rolled him in. 

Q. What position was he in when you put him in the grave? 
A. Face up. 

Q. What was Joe doing at the time that you were doing this burial? 
A. He was digging for part of it but some of the time he was throwing up, I believe. 

Q. Whilst he's been put in the hole what happened with the rest of the burial procedure? 
A. We covered him over with dirt and some stones and Joe put part of a reed bush on top of him. 

Q. After the burial what did you and Joe then do? 
A. Joe took me home. I didn't see him again for the rest of that day. 

Q. Was anything said when he dropped you at home? 
A. He said something along the lines, 'Let's not talk about this ever again'.""

30The police interviewed Mr Kirchner on 30 June 2009. He denied any knowledge of what occurred. He subsequently left the Batemans Bay area and went to Queensland where he was again interviewed by the police on 26 April 2010. On that occasion he admitted that he was present when the accused was shot but denied that he took part in any way. On 28 April 2010 Mr Kirchner took part in a walk through at the scene of the shooting. He was interviewed once again on 5 May 2011 at which time he admitted taking part in the burial of the deceased.

Intercepted conversation between Ms Collins and the accused - 24 October 2009

31Ms Collins visited the accused at Goulburn Gaol on 24 October 2010. She spoke to him on that occasion for approximately one hour. The conversation was secretly recorded without the accused's knowledge. However, Ms Collins was aware in advance that this was to occur.

32Police had assisted Ms Collins before this recorded meeting took place. Some of the questions that she directed at the accused have a flavour of that about them. Notwithstanding this, the closest that the accused came to referring to his involvement in the killing of the deceased is to be found in the following extract from the conversation:

""Collins: 'What if Aaron's told 'em fucking different shit?'

Accused: 'Well, it's only his word.'

Collins: 'I don't want somebody coming...'

Accused: 'It's only his word versus my word.'

Collins: 'I don't want somebody coming and looking for another gun. That's what they're saying that you fucking killed him or that Aaron killed him. They have fucking enough. They're... figuring things out, Joe.'

Accused: 'They won't be able to though. Trust me, Krystelle. At worst, at worst, I'll get held in here for eighteen months, and then I'll be released. That's the worst that could happen.'

Collins: 'You're just going to have to lie and, if you get fucking caught out for it. You're going to have to say that you didn't kill Scott, Aaron did.'

Accused: 'I know nothing.'

Collins: 'Oh, Joey, for fucks sake.'

Accused: 'Yeah.'

Collins: 'We can't talk about it over the phone.'

Accused: 'I know, I know. And I don't like talking about it here either'.""

33It is unnecessary to consider any other portions of the recorded conversation.

Intercepted telephone calls

34A series of recorded telephone conversations between the accused and Ms Collins were also tendered in evidence. The accused placed these calls to Ms Collins from Goulburn Gaol. Both parties to the conversation were aware that they might be recorded. Nothing of any particular significance was to be found in the transcripts of these conversations.

Consideration: count 1

35The crime of murder will have been committed by the accused if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased, that the act causing death was done with an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him or with reckless indifference to human life, and that the act causing death was not carried out in self-defence.

36There is in this case direct and uncontradicted observational evidence that the deceased was shot by the accused on 24 November 2008, and that he died as a result of his injuries. The evidence of Mr Kirchner paints a clear and compelling picture of what occurred. Although he did not see the deceased shot the second time, he saw the first shot and returned the following day to bury the body with the accused. The accused made statements to Mr Kirchner that confirm that he shot the deceased twice and the overwhelming inference is that the second shot that Mr Kirchner heard on his flight back to the accused's ute was a shot by the accused into the back of the skull of the deceased. It is not apparent on the evidence whether the deceased was then still alive. It is clear, however, that he was killed by at least one of the shots fired by the accused from the shotgun that he placed in the vehicle when he returned to it.

37There was much evidence in this case directed to the type of weapon that was used. The accused had purchased two firearms from Mr Weston as earlier described. However, neither of these was the gun that killed the deceased. Forensic evidence before me indicates that the deceased was killed by shots fired from a 20-gauge shotgun. The remnants of the cartridge found in the skull of the deceased at the location where he was buried was of that calibre. The weapon in question has never been recovered. Whether it was the item that the accused placed in the bush wrapped in black plastic following the killing cannot be established.

38The evidence of Ms Collins also intersects with and complements the evidence of Mr Kirchner. Ms Collins said that the accused left their bed in the early hours of the morning of 25 November 2008. He was reported by Mr Kirchner to be knocking on Mr Kirchner's door on the coast shortly thereafter. Mr Kirchner clearly and understandably recalled that event. In like fashion, he recalled returning to the scene of the killing immediately thereafter to bury the deceased. He described what occurred in ways and by reference to details that Ms Collins also recalled but which she could not have known unless they had been related to her by the accused. There has never been any suggestion that she spoke to Mr Kirchner about what occurred. 

39I am satisfied upon the limited evidence available that the deceased died as the result of the injuries he sustained when shot by the accused, and that the shooting was the deliberate act of the accused. I am equally satisfied that the acts causing the death of the deceased were committed with an intention to kill him. I am accordingly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt upon the limited evidence available that the accused committed the offence of the murder of the deceased. 

Count 2 on the indictment

40The accused wrote three letters to his uncle Gerard Wilson. Mr Wilson lives on a farm that he runs in the Murray Valley area of Northern Victoria. The accused is his brother's son.

41The letters were in the handwriting of the accused and are dated 29 January, 7 February and 15 March 2010. The accused was in custody when the letters were written. One of the letters enclosed a photograph of Krystelle Collins.

42The first letter refers to Ms Collins as ""the main witness for the police"" and continues in the following terms:

""I want the fucking dog dead as before 22nd March. If this can be arranged write back and say the dog had pups or you sold your tractor.""

43The letter proceeds to describe Ms Collins and to supply her date of birth and phone number.

44The letter dated 7 February 2010 commences as follows:

""Remember what I asked in the letter about the person in the photo, if you can send me a letter and say the old dog had pups that means yes. If you can't then if you lend me $20,000 I can get a bloke from the Middle East to fly to Aust and do the job...My mate said he can have the job done in 1 or 2 weeks. We just don't know her address? Can you find out her address and write back with it if you can find out it. He also said if I can get $10,000 it can be done and I pay the other $10,000 in 2011, also pay half before job and half when it has been done. The money has to be put into West Union [sic] and sent to Middle East and I need the receipt sent to me in here and then it will be done, I don't know how to do this but you should.""

45The third letter contains nothing that informs the second count on the indictment. It remains relevant only as part of the sequence containing the earlier letters.

Count 3 on the indictment

46Between 6 April 2009 and 6 February 2010 the accused wrote a series of letters to Krystelle Collins. One of the letters is undated, and is addressed ""To crown witness Krystelle"", and includes the following material:

""...you can't keep secrets for long, I know where you live in Feb you'll get a knock on the door and I'd stand back from the door and also give back my wallet. Also I didn't pull the trigger on Scott it was Aaron, I could be out in a short period of time thanks and giving up on me you've lost the best thing you'll ever have, you are a weak cunt...

You are the worst girl I have ever been with you are bad dog. The bloke that you and your dad knifed in the neck and killed and dumped the body on the railway lines in Goulburn, his mate is in my yard in jail and he said he's going to get you and kill you, he gets out soon!!""

47The letter dated 6 February 2010 concludes with the following material:

""Don't give this letter to the cops, or Peter White will try to kill you, then who will look after [your daughter], he's a bad murderer, and lier [sic]. I am sick of writing so write back ASAP and tell me if you are going to go to court to give evidence, if you give evidence I'll hate you forever.""

48Ms Collins also gave the following evidence relating to her knowledge of what occurred and the position in which she found herself:

""Q. How did your relationship go from that time that he told you that he had shot Mr Bryan, what was your relationship like from that point? 
A. It was different it went downhill from there. 

Q. Did you remain out staying out at Nelligen? 
A. I did stay out there on and off yes. 

Q. Why did you do that? 
A. Well two reasons why because I was scared for my safety and my daughter's safety and my family's safety if I left him and because I loved him. 

Q. Why were you scared for your safety, your daughter's safety and your family's safety? 
A. Because he threatened me. 

Q. What did he say? 
A. He said to me, 'If I open my mouth I would be dead' and in seven days he said, 'If I can't get you I'll go for your family'.""

Consideration: counts 2 and 3 - defence of mental illness

49It is uncontroversial that every man and woman is presumed to be sane and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his or her crimes until the contrary is proven. In order to establish a defence on the ground of mental illness it must be clearly proved that, at the time of committing the act, the accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong: R v M'Naghten (1843) 8 ER 718. 

50In cases involving a jury the jury would not be required to consider the defence of mental illness until it were satisfied that the offence had been proved beyond reasonable doubt: R v Stiles (1990) 50 A Crim R 13. I also observe that in considering whether an accused person committed the offence(s) charged, a jury would be instructed to ignore the question of mental illness when determining whether the accused had the intent charged, relying upon the presumption of sanity. In this way they may acquit on the defence of mental illness if they find that the accused did not have the necessary intention as a result of the defect of reason. If there were evidence of mental illness, a jury would not consider the question of intention or voluntariness separate and distinct from the issue of mental illness.

51A ""disease of the mind"" is any disease capable of affecting the mind, whether it has a mental or physical origin and whether or not the defect of reason is temporary or permanent: R v Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399. Whether the condition amounts to a disease of the mind is a question of law: R v Falconer [1990] HCA 49; (1990) 171 CLR 30 at 60. A ""defect of reason"" is the inability of the accused to think rationally: R v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1936) 55 CLR 182 at 189-190; Sodeman v The King [1936] HCA 75; (1936) 55 CLR 192 at 367.

52A person does not know the nature and quality of his (or her) act if he does not know the physical nature of what he is doing or the implications of it. A person does not know what he was doing was wrong when he does not know that it was wrong according to ordinary standards of right or wrong adopted by reasonable persons (see Stapleton v The Queen [1952] HCA 56; (1952) 86 CLR 358 at 367), or where the accused cannot reason with some moderate degree of calmness in relation to the moral quality of what he is doing: Sodeman v The King (supra) at 215; R v Pangallo (1989) 51 SASR 254.

53Medical evidence is not essential to prove insanity: Lucas v The Queen [1970] HCA 14; (1970) 120 CLR 171. The tribunal of fact cannot reject unanimous medical evidence unless there is evidence that can cast doubt upon it, but such evidence may be found in the behaviour of the accused. The tribunal of fact may decide between competing medical evidence. Medical witnesses may give evidence of their opinion as to whether the accused could appreciate the nature and quality of his acts or, if he could, whether he knew it was wrong: Thomas v The Queen [1960] HCA 2; (1960) 102 CLR 584.

54The accused was born in 1976 and was therefore 31 years of age on 24 November 2008 when the original events that precipitated the present charges occurred. The psychiatric medical history of the accused is long and significant. Its aetiology predates these events and must be considered in some detail. The medical opinions expressed concerning the accused and his mental condition are also unanimous. They are referred to in what follows.

Professor Greenberg

55Professor Greenberg initially examined the accused at the Silverwater Remand and Reception Centre on 5 August 2011. He took an extensive history from the accused, including in relation to the subject charges. The accused reported seeing a psychologist at the direction of a court as long ago as 1992. He was not diagnosed with any illness. In 1999 he was admitted to Chisholm Ross Psychiatric Unit at Goulburn Hospital for eleven days. He was given antipsychotic injections of Chlorpromazine at that time. He was discharged with a regime of medication that he disregarded. The accused had approximately six subsequent admissions to Goulburn Hospital for drug-induced psychosis.

56The accused has a documented history of schizophrenia with a previous history of fixed grandiose and persecutory delusions. He has an indifferent history of compliance with antipsychotic medication regimes. Apart from admissions to Goulburn Hospital for mental illness, he has also been admitted for the same reason to Batemans Bay Hospital.

57The accused told Professor Greenberg that he began to smoke cannabis at the age of three. He claimed to have been regularly using the drug since he was 28 years old. He also admitted to using amphetamines but his reports about this were bizarre and were unlikely to have been completely accurate.

58The accused attended St Joseph's School in Batemans Bay and St Bernard's School in Bellingen. He then attended St Patrick's High School in Goulburn until part way through Year 9 and then Batemans Bay High School. He left school to begin work. He denied learning difficulties. He also denied any conduct or behavioural problems during adolescence. He had one previous contact with the Children's Court in 1994.

59The accused said that a teacher sexually abused him for a two-year period between the ages of six and seven. He claimed to have reported this abuse ""on seven hundred occasions"" to the police. He also said that a magistrate tried to molest him when he was six years old whilst he was in a helicopter between Batemans Bay and Jamberoo. He claimed that his arms were chopped off and subsequently sewn back on.

60Professor Greenberg expressed the opinion that the accused was then unfit to plead or to stand trial. He came to a different conclusion following a further examination of the accused in January 2012. He maintained the view that the accused was fit to plead and to stand trial after his examination of the accused in April 2013. However, following a psychiatric assessment of the accused in August 2013, Professor Greenberg concluded that the accused was then no longer fit to plead or to stand trial. In forming that view, Professor Greenberg expressed the following opinion:

""I am of the opinion that Mr Wilson would have difficulty appreciating the substantial effect of evidence given in Court given his acute paranoid psychotic symptoms including bizarre somatic and paranoid delusional beliefs. Also at times his thoughts were disjointed and his various delusional beliefs appear to be intertwined with his understanding of his cognitive reality. He claimed that his solicitor, Jennifer Powell, and he went to TAFE together; they had done a course in dairy farming. He then stated that if someone wanted to clean up your house and if you had never seen them before, would you let them in? He ruminated about having money under the mattress and Blue Tac on the lock. He explained his distress about the legal system. When questioned about whether he would receive a fair trial, he stated that he had reservations about the impartiality of the Judge. He stated that he would demand ""blood tests and photos"" of all the jury members before he would be comfortable that they were going to give him a fair trial. Mr Wilson also questioned the role of his solicitor. He stated that it would not matter even if he selected his own lawyer because if the jury was not up to scratch it doesn't matter. Mr Wilson's paranoid belief system appeared to be impinging on his acceptance that he could receive a fair trial. He appears to believe he cannot be represented by his legal representation and the impartiality of the Judge and/or jury is in question.""

61It became clear from Professor Greenberg's reports that the mental condition of the accused at any particular time, and from time to time, was closely related to the extent to which he complied with prescribed regimes of antipsychotic medication. The accused had a poor record of regular maintenance of these regimes. Assessments of his fitness to plead and to stand trial were directly related to the accused's compliance or non-compliance with recommendations that he take antipsychotic medication as prescribed.

Dr Olav Nielssen

62Dr Nielssen examined the accused on several occasions between June 2011 and July 2013. In August 2013 Dr Nielssen expressed the opinion that the accused was suffering from an acute exacerbation of chronic schizophrenia and substance abuse disorder (in remission). He proffered the following opinion:

""Mr Wilson is currently affected by an exacerbation of his chronic schizophrenic illness, that appears to be due to ceasing treatment with antipsychotic medication, as I understand he was recently found to be fit and was discharged from the mental health area of the prison back to Goulburn Correctional Centre. He no longer has insight regarding the nature of his illness, the symptoms of his illness, or his need for treatment.

Mr Wilson is again unfit for trial. He has probably retained an understanding of the charges some capacity to respond to those charges, and a general understanding of the general nature of a trial and the procedure followed in an adversarial trial. However, his interpretation of developments in the case is likely to be affected by evolving persecutory delusional beliefs, disorganised thinking and grossly impaired judgment that would affect his capacity to follow proceedings or provide rational instructions.

Mr Wilson has a condition that has been shown to respond to treatment with moderate doses of antipsychotic medication. Based on his previous response to treatment with moderate doses of antipsychotic medication, I believe he will again respond to treatment with antipsychotic medication and become fit for trial after several months of treatment.""

Other evidence

63The accused's uncle Gerard Wilson gave evidence before me and was asked about the letters he received from the accused:

""Q. You've seen that the material you have been provided with are copies of the letters that you were forwarded from Goulburn Gaol? 
A. They were the same letters, yes. 

Q. And that they were letters from your nephew Joseph Wilson? 
A. Yes, that is correct. 

Q. Did you know at the time you received the letters that he was in custody? 
A. Yes, I did. 

Q. Did one of those letters include a photograph? 
A. Yes, I think it was the second one. One of them, yes. 

Q. Who was the photograph of? 
A. Of his girlfriend. 

Q. Had you ever met her? 
A. I had never met her but I saw her once or twice. 

Q. In those letters a number of requests were made of you by your nephew? 

A. Yes. 

Q. Essentially the request was for the person Krystelle Collins to be killed? 

A. Yes yeah, yeah. 

Q. Your nephew wanted you to arrange that? 
A. Well he wanted some money from me to arrange it, I think. 

Q. Did you respond to any of his requests? 
A. No, none whatsoever. 

Q. You had no contact with him either through the mail or over the phone whilst he was at the gaol? 
A. No, none at all. 

Q. Did you do any of the things that he asked you to do in those letters? 
A. No. 

Q. Have you had any contact with your nephew Joseph Wilson other than these letters? 
A. No.""

64Mr Wilson was subsequently cross-examined about the letters. He gave this evidence:

""Q. Did any of that make sense? 
A. None of it made any sense at all to me. 

Q. There's talk about you buying Mogo Station to run 800 cows and various other things; did that make any sense at all? 
A. I knew where Mogo Station was because I think Joe might have worked there at one stage but apart from that, I don't know, it made no sense at all. 

Q. Or that your gran had $90 million from bank robberies? 
A. No. Yeah, no, it made no sense at all. 

Q. In terms of what he was seeking from you, did you just stick it in a drawer and forget about it, did you? 
A. Well, yes. 

Q. Did you discuss with anybody some of the more unusual statements in the letter? 
A. I never discussed it with anyone, only my wife. 

Q. Such as saying that you said that Dad owned Carlton United Brewery? 
A. We never talked about that, it was hardly worth talking about. 

Q. In terms of their contents, they were just completely disconnected from reality? 
A. I think so, yes. 

Q. So you made no response and just left them as they were? 
A. Yeah. 

...

Q. Did you speak to anyone else in terms of your extended family about the contents of these letters or the fact that he was sending them to you? 
A. No.""

65Professor Greenberg was the only medical professional to give oral evidence concerning the accused's mental condition. This was important because counts 2 and 3 on the indictment appeared to me squarely to raise the mental state of the accused at the time when he is alleged to have performed the acts that found these charges. Central to these charges are the letters written to his uncle and to Ms Collins. Professor Greenberg was asked about these letters with a view to determining or assessing the likelihood or otherwise that the accused was relevantly mentally ill at the time they were written. His evidence about this was as follows:

""HIS HONOUR: ...I would be interested to know whether it was Professor Greenberg's view that every one of those letters was, or if not which ones among them were, written by the accused whilst in a delusional state at the time that he is referred to.

AINSWORTH

Q. Can you differentiate between the letters in those terms, can you say that one is and one is not, for example, written at a time when his delusional mindset is prevailing? 
A. I think the shorter letters, there's less delusional or less disjointedness. The longer letters he tires and becomes more disorganised and the delusions are finishing more on his thinking. For example, the letter to 'big Joe' dated 29 January 2010, which is 13 pages, he clearly has become more delusional as he continues to write that letter. The short letters to Krystelle, the undated letter has less delusional thinking and likewise with the letter dated 6 February 2010. But underlying all of these letters is a man with a condition which is treatment resistant. 

The shorter letter dated 15 March 2010, which is only one page, he clearly has some understanding of the legal process and some understanding of the delusions around fitness. It's just an example of his delusional thinking, it becomes evident as he tires, as his thoughts become more disorganised with the writing. It's less evident with the shorter letters and more evident with the longer letters. 

Q. But the underlying condition never changes? 
A. The underlying condition never changes but the capsule around the delusional thinking is less prominent with the shorter letters, less obvious with the shorter letters. 

Q. They break out of the capsule the longer he attempts to commit to writing things on paper; the longer it goes on, the more the delusional mindset seeps out of the capsule? 
A. The longer he tries to focus his cognition and his thinking on to certain matters, the more the capsule breaks down. 

Q. So something that he has to think about or organise or describe in a lengthy way is likely to end up with the capsule breaking down as he applies the mental effort to that task? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. Certainly the longer letters to big Joe, it's quite evident that he is latching into that grandiose and delusional mindset that is very much a part of his schizophrenia? 
A. Yes. 

HIS HONOUR 

Q. Is this a condition that renders the accused liable to have periods of lucidity and periods of psychotic irrationality or is he, subject to medication of course, always likely to have a period when he's unaffected by his psychosis? 
A. I think, your Honour, from approximately the year 2010, 2009, Mr Wilson's mental state is such that he never completely becomes rational or free of delusional beliefs and psychotic symptoms. I think in the last two years or three years his mental illness, at least the severity, is entering the spectrum where he is unable to be treated unable to restore fitness to stand trial because of the severity of the illness. So although when he writes letters he has lucid periods where he can make seemingly coherent, rational decisions about his court case and about his legal matters, the underlying illness is still present throughout. And it hasn't always been like that, there obviously have been times when he was living in the community and he was functioning quite well. He was able to leave hospital, he responded to treatment, he conducted himself in the community. There's been a marked change in his mental state from the year 2009, 2010 until now and that seems to be fairly fixed now; it's not responding to any psychiatric treatment and hasn't improved. 

Q. I'm not so much for present purposes concerned about the immediate current state so much as the state that may have existed at the time that he wrote any one or some of the letters. You have used the expression in referring to the matters that he wrote in those letters as being, on occasions, your quote, 'Seemingly coherent'. Do I, or do we, understand from that we should be cautious about treating matters that appear coherent, having regard to the condition from which he was suffering? 
A. Yes, I think one has to be cautious at this point because his mental state now seems to be fixed, treatment resistant and clearly influenced, for the most, by his delusional beliefs.""

Disposition

66Regardless of who raises the defence, the onus lies upon the accused to prove the requisite mental illness on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v The Queen [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659. In this case the defence was raised by the accused.

67In the particular circumstances of this case I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities, on the limited evidence available, that the accused was suffering from a disease of the mind and that he was labouring under such a defect of reason as a consequence, that he knew neither the nature and quality of his actions nor that what he was doing was wrong at the time that he committed the acts constituting the second and third counts on the indictment. I consider that the evidence in this respect is highly persuasive. I have formed that view for the following reasons.

68First, the reaction by the accused's uncle to the letters sent to him was one of apparent and sanguine indifference. He told his wife about the letters but no one else. He did not report them to the police. He effectively treated them as emanating from an unreliable and labile source. He ignored them as not deserving of further consideration. In the events that occurred, it would seem that his wife took a similar view. This is all the more significant in my view having regard to the fact that three letters were written. Although hardly determinative of the issue in a technical sense, Mr Wilson's reaction to the letters was consistent with a common sense lay view or reaction that they were written by a person with a serious mental condition.

69Secondly, the fact that the letters were sent at all from gaol in the terms in which they were written bespeaks not merely a fundamental absence of any sense of self-preservation on the part of the accused but what must have in truth been a wholly hysterical and fantastic perception of reality. The accused's uncle is a farmer and grazier in northern Victoria. He had no access to the criminal underworld or to aspiring Middle Eastern assassins or contract killers. The likelihood that he either could or would engage in the activities described by the accused was completely absent. Even if the letters were arguably written with some still undisclosed purpose, the letters could not have been written by a person who was not at least suffering from the effects of a serious mental condition. 

70Thirdly, the content of the letters was inconsistent with sanity. There are delusional and grandiose references to matters clearly demonstrating that their author was likely to be suffering from some form of serious mental disorder when they were written. At one point the accused referred to ""gran"" telling him that ""she had $90 million from the bank robberies."" The letters contain what amounts to a barely coherent collection of unrelated topics thrust together in no particular sequence. The letters are superficially intelligible but realistically nonsensical. This is what I take Professor Greenberg to have had in contemplation when he described the letters as ""seemingly coherent.""

71Finally, the expert medical opinion from Professor Greenberg is that they were written by the accused when his mental state was fixed, treatment resistant and clearly influenced, for the most part, by his delusional beliefs.

72In my opinion the letters written to Ms Collins that underpin the third count on the indictment were also written by the accused when afflicted with this same condition. The letters were all written between April 2009 and February 2010 and so fall within the post-2008 period identified by Professor Greenberg. That was the period during which Professor Greenberg said that the accused's mental state was such that he never completely became rational or free of delusional beliefs or psychotic symptoms.

73It follows in my opinion that, having regard to the expert opinions and other evidence touching upon the issue, the accused has established on the balance of probabilities that a defence of mental illness has been made out.

Consequential matters

74As a result of my finding, on the limited evidence available, that the accused committed the offence of murder, it becomes necessary to have regard to certain further provisions of the Act. Sections 23 and 24 of the Act provide relevantly as follows:

""23 Procedure after completion of special hearing 

(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court: 

(a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and 

(b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence, must nominate a term, in this section referred to as 
'a limiting term' , in respect of that offence, being the best estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence. 

(2) ... 

(4) In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence). 

(5) A limiting term nominated in respect of a person takes effect from the time when it is nominated unless the Court: 

(a) after taking into account the periods, if any, of the person's custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence), directs that the term be taken to have commenced at an earlier time, or ...

24 Consequences of nomination of limiting term 

(1) If in respect of a person a Court has nominated a limiting term, the Court: 

(a) must refer the person to the Tribunal, and 

(b) may make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate. 

(2)...""

75In my opinion, if this special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence of murder, which I have found the accused to have committed, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment. I propose therefore to nominate a limiting term in respect of the offence of murder, being the best estimate of the sentence I would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against the accused as a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the accused had been found guilty of that offence.

76In the light of s 23(1)(b) of the Act, I am obliged, when determining a limiting term, to adopt and to apply all of the statutory and common law principles of sentencing that apply to a person convicted of the offence in question: R v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at [13]. A limiting term is the period beyond which a person cannot be detained for the offence which was the subject of the special hearing: R v Mitchell [1999] NSWCCA 120; (1999) 108 A Crim R 85 at [30]. 

77In R v Mailes [2004] NSWCCA 394; (2004) 62 NSWLR 181, Dunford J said at [32] that the purpose of a limiting term:

""...is not to punish the person who has not been convicted of any crime, but to ensure that he or she is not detained in custody longer than the maximum the person could have been detained if so convicted following a proper trial...""

78The statutory standard non-parole period scheme also does not apply to the imposition of a limiting term: s 54D(1)(b) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The ""sentence"" referred to in s 23 of the Act is therefore to be taken as a reference to the total sentence and not the non-parole period since there is no power to fix a non-parole period less than the total term: Mailes at [29].

Relevance of medical condition to length of limiting term

79I have earlier considered the mental condition of the accused in some detail. Impaired mental functioning, whether transitory or permanent, is relevant to sentencing: see Courtney v R [2007] NSWCCA 195; (2007) 172 A Crim R 371 at [14]. The evidence relating to the accused's mental condition both at the time that he committed the offence and now is therefore relevant to the current sentencing exercise and must be considered. Even though the accused does not have a defence to the charge of murder arising from his mental illness, that does not mean that his underlying psychotic condition of schizophrenia and his substance abuse disorder are not relevant to the determination of the appropriate sentence: R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485.

80However, even though the accused's mental condition is a factor to be taken into account, it does not operate to displace other matters, including the objective seriousness of the offence. In Bhuiyan v R [2009] NSWCCA 221 at [30], McClellan CJ at CL said:

""[30] In R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 Gleeson CJ recognised the difficulties faced by a court when sentencing persons with mental disorders. Those difficulties are compounded when a person is found not fit to be tried but, applying conventional principles a court is required to determine a limiting term. It is necessary to keep steadfastly in mind that although in most cases the serious mental illness will have deprived an offender of their usual capacity for reason and control it must not be allowed to overwhelm appropriate consideration of the circumstances of the offence and the other subjective features of the offender. The particular difficulties faced by an offender which may have contributed to the offence will be addressed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal which in appropriate circumstances may release the offender before the limiting term has expired.""

81By 24 November 2008 the accused had a demonstrated and recorded history of psychosis requiring admission from time to time to a mental treatment facility and the prescription of anti-psychotic medication. Although that condition was to some extent amenable or responsive to such medication, the accused also had a history of disregarding medical advice to maintain a consistent or regular attitude to it. It is not therefore possible in such circumstances confidently to assume that this long-standing and deteriorating mental illness was not a factor that contributed in some way to the accused's offending behaviour or that it is not relevant to an assessment of his culpability.


Other factors relevant to sentencing

82The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. The accused has been in custody in circumstances relevant to the offence of murder since 27 February 2010.

83It was submitted by the Crown that this case was in the worst category of murder. It was planned. The accused lured the deceased to a secluded location forearmed with a shotgun with the intention of killing him and disposing of his body in a way that was designed to avoid detection. The deceased had no reason to be with the accused in that location apart from the accused's criminal seduction that drew him there.

84The offence was committed with the use of a weapon.

85The Crown also contended that the accused occupied a position of trust in relation to the deceased. This was said to arise from the deceased's mental condition, his impoverished station in life and the apparent respect that he harboured for the accused. As accurate as these contentions may be, they do not to my mind operate to constitute the aggravating feature for which the Crown contends.

86The Crown also contended that the presence of Mr Kirchner operated to mean that the offence was committed in company. I reject that submission. It is an error to take account of the fact that an offence was arguably committed in company when that fact added no significant culpability to the offence: see Gore and Hunter v R [2010] NSWCCA 330 at [30], [101]-[102]. Mr Kirchner's presence in the circumstances of this case was wholly irrelevant to the offence. Nothing that he did or said contributed in any way to the murder of the deceased. Mr Kirchner's assistance to bury the deceased's body is beside the point.

87I have earlier found that the accused killed the deceased with the intention of doing so. That factor adds to the seriousness of the offence.

88I do not consider that special deterrence is something that should operate to inform the proper sentence in this case. The mental condition of the accused, from which it appears he is likely to suffer without respite for the rest of his life, renders special deterrence meaningless. The extent to which general deterrence should operate upon that sentence is less clear. However, the senseless killing of any person should be condemned out of hand. The particular killing in this case was so gratuitous and unwarranted that any sentence imposed in the ordinary course following a trial ought necessarily to operate as a public disavowal of such cruel behaviour.

89By reason of the accused's current chronic severe mental condition, issues of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation are wholly irrelevant and I have disregarded them in forming my view concerning the proper length of any limiting term that I should impose.

90In the light of all of these matters I consider that this offence of murder is to be assessed as falling somewhere slightly above the middle range of seriousness for offences of this type.

Conclusions and orders

91In these circumstances I consider that I should make the following orders:

1. I find upon the limited evidence available that the accused Joseph Rowan Wilson committed the offence of the murder of Scott Daniel Bryan on 24 November 2008.

2. I indicate that if the special hearing involving the accused had been a normal trial against a person fit to be tried, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment.

3. I nominate as the limiting term in respect of the offence of murder a period of 18 years commencing on 27 February 2010.

4. I find that the accused Joseph Rowan Wilson is not guilty of soliciting Gerard Michael Wilson between 29 January 2010 and 7 February 2010 to murder Krystelle Lee Collins by reason of mental illness.

5. I find that the accused Joseph Rowan Wilson is not guilty of committing an act between 15 December 2009 and 6 February 2010 intended to cause Krystelle Lee Collins to give false evidence by reason of mental illness.

6. In accordance with s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I order that Joseph Rowan Wilson be detained in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law.

7. Pursuant to s 39(3) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I direct that the Registrar of this Court notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of these orders.

Further matters

92It is important that the tragic circumstances of this case do not pass without mention of the understandable grief that attends the loss of a loved one. The deceased was a man whose own life had unfortunately been affected by the disabling consequences of mental illness. His death was a cruel and unforeseen consequence of events that could not realistically have been prevented or anticipated. I extend my sympathy to those of his relatives and friends who are left without him.

93It is also important to understand and appreciate that the system of criminal justice in this State does not provide for findings of guilt or punishment for crimes unless the accused person has been found to have committed the charged offence to the requisite standard of proof according to law. There can be a tendency, understandable in the extreme, for some of us to feel the need for vengeance, for punishment and for retribution when the acts of another have led to the death of an innocent person. Sometimes a defence, such as a defence of mental illness as in this case, will appear to many as some kind of inappropriate and artificial legal construct that permits the guilty to go free and victims to be left without answers. It is not. It is necessary at these times to understand that the particular events that occurred in this case are much like a catastrophic and unavoidable accident. The only significant difference in the end result is that it will usually be easier to come to terms with a death resulting from a cruel freak of nature, like a landslide or a bushfire, than those cases where another person has committed the physical acts that have caused the death. Unfortunately for the deceased in this case he was, through no fault of his own, in the wrong place at the wrong time, just as much as if he had perished in a natural disaster.

94I also extend my sympathies and concern to the relatives and friends of Mr Wilson. His long and troublesome mental affliction is a continuing and unfortunate fact of his life and of theirs. Hopefully some relief from its burden will eventually emerge for him and for them.

		19 November 2013",2013-11-14 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705864,R v FE [2013] NSWSC 1692,"JudgmentIntroduction1At about 2am on Sunday 8 July 2012, Christopher Brilliantes stabbed Patrick Crowe at the Parramatta Transport Interchange. Crowe died a few hours later from the stab wound inflicted by the knife that had pierced his lung. Brilliantes pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced on 8 November 2013.
2By indictment presented on 11 November 2013, FE, the accused, pleaded not guilty to both counts:
1. On 8 July 2012 at Parramatta in the State of New South Wales used unlawful violence towards Patrick CROWE by conduct that would cause a person of reasonable firmness present at the scene to fear for his or her personal safety.
2. On 8 July 2012 at Parramatta in the State of New South Wales did murder Patrick CROWE.
3Prior to the commencement of the trial, there was a voir dire to determine the admissibility of two records of interview with the accused. The first was conducted when she presented herself at Parramatta Police Station on 12 July 2012. The second was an Electronically Recorded Interview with Suspected Person (ERISP) conducted after her arrest on 2 August 2012.
Facts
4It is necessary to set out in some detail what was known to the police when the accused presented at Parramatta Police Station on the evening of 12 July 2012. These facts enable a finding to be made whether she was relevantly a suspect or a witness. Relevant facts concerning the two interviews to which objection is taken will also be outlined and the statements relied on as admissions in both interviews identified.
5The Crown relies on the interviews on two bases: first, the accused made admissions in the course of each of them; and secondly, that she lied in each of them. The Crown confirmed that it did not rely on the lies as amounting to a consciousness of guilt, but that it would rely on the lies to impugn the accused's credibility if she gave evidence at the trial. 
The commencement of the investigation: Sunday 8 July 2012
6On Sunday 8 July 2012, Detective Sergeant Fenwick was appointed officer-in-charge of the investigation. On that day statements were taken from Joshua Thompson and Dean Roche, friends of the deceased who were with him when he was stabbed. Statements were also taken on 8 July 2012, from Shenoda Rizk and Reza Bahramrad, independent witnesses who saw the stabbing. CCTV footage was obtained from Westfield Shopping Centre and from Railcorp that recorded the events leading up to and including the stabbing and its aftermath.
7Thompson said in his statement that he, Roche and the deceased had encountered three girls in Church Street Mall. He described two out of the three. His description of one of them is consistent with the appearance of the accused. He told of a continuing altercation, principally between the three girls and Crowe. Thompson's impression was that Roche appeared to be siding with the girls against Thompson and Crowe. Thompson then described the arrival of four males and the ensuing confrontation that resulted in the death of Crowe. 
8In his statement, Roche recounted that he had been drinking with Crowe and Thompson when they saw three girls on the way to the interchange. He recalled that two of the girls were of Islander appearance and the third was Caucasian. He described a verbal exchange between Crowe and the girls. He diverted to Hungry Jacks to buy food while Thompson and Crowe went ahead to the bus stop. When Roche joined them at the bus stop he noticed that the three girls were already there. 
9According to Roche's statement, one of the girls announced that she did not like the other two boys but that she liked Roche. Crowe took exception to this comment and reacted by pushing Roche into a planter box. When Roche stood up, he saw four or five Islander boys running towards them. The boys began to assault Crowe and Roche. Roche heard one of the girls, whom he thought was the Caucasian one, yelling at the boys, pointing towards him (Roche) and saying, ""Don't hurt him.""
10Roche described the assault and said that it lasted for about 30 seconds. The Islander males ran away after Crowe was stabbed. Later in hospital, Thompson told Roche: ""I got threatened by a knife, that's why I didn't jump in the fight, I froze up.""
11Rizk, an independent witness, was waiting for a bus at the interchange at the same stop where Crowe and Thompson were waiting for Roche. Rizk observed the interaction between the two males and three females who also came to the bus stop. He saw the third male, Roche, arrive. He saw the girls arguing, principally with Thompson, who was wearing a red jumper. He also saw one of the girls receiving calls on her mobile phone. He heard the girl say on the phone, ""I'm waiting at the bus stop."" He saw a confrontation between Roche and Crowe, concerning the girls, at the conclusion of which Crowe pushed Roche over. 
12Rizk described the arrival of four young males, some of whom had dark, but not black skin. He said in his statement:26. The three girls started pointing at the male with the off-white t-shirt and saying ""This guy, this guy.""
27. The male with the red jumper ran to the bus stop to my left and the male with the off-white t-shirt went to the bus stop to my right. The four young males followed the male with the off-white t-shirt and surrounded him.
28. As the four young males ran past me towards the male in the off-white t-shirt, I saw the last young male was carrying a knife in his right hand down by his side. The knife had a shiny blade which was wide and about five inches long with a pointed tip. The knife wasn't a kitchen knife.
29. The young male carrying the knife was about 17-18 years old, skinny and short, maybe 150cm tall, wearing pants and an off-white coloured jumper. 
30. When the four young males surrounded the male with the off-white t-shirt, he moved backwards until he got to the bus stop seat and he sat down. The four young males started hitting him with their hands. I didn't see the male in the off-white t-shirt fighting back. After a few seconds the four young males ran away to the right.
13Bahramrad was also waiting for a bus at the interchange, about 50 ms away directly opposite the bus bay from where Crowe and Thompson were waiting for their bus. He heard an argument between a male and a female and then saw five or six males of Islander appearance running towards them. It appeared to him that the males were reacting to whatever had happened between the male and the female. According to Bahramrad:The two males that were trying to shield the Caucasian male, whom was having an argument with the female, appeared to me that they were trying to apologise to Islander males, and protect him and themselves from getting injured.
14Bahramrad tried to intervene, without success. He said:""At this point one of the islander males has left the group and walked towards me he would have been about 10 metres from me, he said words similar to, ""Didn't you see what he did to my sister."" I responded by saying words similar to he is ""scared leave him alone if you [don't] stop I will call the cops.""
15Bahramrad subsequently saw one of the Caucasian males, Crowe, slumped to the ground. When Bahramrad approached Crowe and saw that he was bleeding, he tied his top around him to put pressure on the wound.
Warrants obtained on Tuesday 10 July 2012
16On Tuesday 10 July 2012 police obtained telephone intercept warrants with respect to Brilliantes' mobile phone and also the phone of young person JV, who was one of the males with Brilliantes who had been identified from CCTV footage. SL and Judel Godoy had also been identified from CCTV footage as being among the young males who were present at the scene at the time of the stabbing.
Wednesday 11 July 2012: the arrests of JV, Brilliantes, Godoy and TC
17On the morning of Wednesday 11 July 2012, JV attended Parramatta police station with his grandfather, aunt and a solicitor. He was arrested and charged with affray. He was cautioned. On legal advice he declined to be interviewed.
18At 4.20 pm on 11 July 2012, Detective Fenwick went with other police officers to a unit at Noller Parade in Parramatta to execute a search warrant. Brilliantes was arrested and charged. One of the items seized was Brilliantes' mobile phone.
19Godoy was interviewed by police on the evening of Wednesday 11 July 2012. He was fairly vague about what happened on 8 July 2012. He recalled hearing the girls ""yelling"" during the fight. He identified himself and Brilliantes in stills taken from CCTV footage. He also identified stills of two of the three girls who were also there, HH and ZP, although he did not name them.
20The CCTV footage available to police at that time contained images of the platform where the deceased was stabbed, as well as other footage by which some of the protagonists were identified. The footage depicted a female pointing at Crowe before he is stabbed by Brilliantes. This female, the accused, was not one of the two girls whom Brilliantes identified.
21On Wednesday 11 July 2012 TC was arrested and charged with affray. He was cautioned at the Parramatta Police Station in the presence of his father at 8.35 pm. He received legal advice by telephone from Children's Legal Service, which is provided by Legal Aid. He was asked by police what he was advised to say and he informed police that he had been told not to participate in an interview. He declined to participate in a line-up when he was informed that he was not obliged to. 
22Brilliantes was interviewed at 9.36 pm that evening. He made a full confession. There was no reference in his ERISP to any encouragement having been given to him by the accused or her female friends to stab Crowe, although the three girls are mentioned in his statement. He admitted to receiving a phone call from JV following which he attended the interchange with other male associates whom he identified as Godoy, TC and SL. He was asked to identify persons from still photographs taken by CCTV cameras which were blown up and shown to him in the course of the ERISP. He also identified HH and ZP from stills taken by CCTV cameras and gave police their first names. 
Thursday 12 July 2012: the media release
23On Thursday 12 July 2012, Superintendent Redfern issued a media release which was shown on Channels Seven, Nine and Ten. He told Detective Fenwick about the release during the afternoon although the latter saw neither the release itself, nor any of the broadcasts. 
24The Channel Seven 6 pm news contained the following statements:Reporter: It's the police case that Patrick and his friends came across three girls as they headed for the bus stops at Parramatta ""the females verbally abused the three men who responded with verbal taunts"". Witnesses say the girls followed them. There were more insults, one made a phone call and several males arrived. She was seeing pointing at Patrick saying: ""this guy, this guy"". The 22-year-old was surrounded, kicked, punched then stabbed twice.
Judel Godoy has told the police his friend Brilliantes tried to give him a knife saying: ""clean it"". The 18-year-old is being charged with concealing a murder. He's been released on bail with strict curfew and banned from central Parramatta.
The investigation into Patrick Crowe's murder is far from over. Police are still trying to find four people: a man in his late teens of Islander appearance and three girls aged between 15 and 17.
Police: ... We will do whatever we can to find you and bring you to justice.
25The Channel Ten news contained the following statements:Report: This case has broken wide open?
Reporter: Yes it has, Bill. Last night police arrested four young men. Two of the four are adults, whilst the other two are legally children and today those two adults face court here at Parramatta Local Court and tonight one of them remains behind bars, whilst the other has been released on bail.
Report: Eighteen-year-old Judel Godoy was there when Patrick Crowe was murdered, but he tried to hide from police. When detectives finally caught him, last night the teenager suddenly opened up and that honesty helped him get bail today.
The 18-year-old was nabbed by a special strike force, set up to investigate the stabbing death of 22-year-old Patrick Crowe. As the sun set, police filmed the arrests.. . .
Report: Twenty-one -year-old Christopher Brilliantes is the accused murderer. Today in court he didn't show his face; instead he stayed in the cells and didn't apply for bail.  Eighteen-year-old Godoy is charged with concealing a murder. Two other boys aged 15 and 16 were also charged with affray.
Patrick Crowe had been on a night out with mates when he was attacked at the Parramatta transport hub early on Sunday morning.
The apprentice chef was stabbed twice and was rushed to hospital to have surgery on a collapsed lung but later died.  Police aren't done yet. They are still hunting one man and three women.
Police: We will do whatever we can to bring you to justice and if you're out there, my advice is to come forward and speak to police.
Reporter: Now late today, court documents were released, which explain why police are so keen to speak to those young women. 
Police say it was those young women started the verbal argument with Patrick Crowe, and a group of young males attacked him after one of the young women pointed Patrick Crowe out and said: ""this guy, this guy"" and as we know, Patrick Crowe is now dead.
The interview with the accused on 12 July 2012
26Just after 7 pm on 12 July 2012, the accused, HH and ZP presented themselves at the Parramatta Police Station. The accused recounted the circumstances of her arrival in her evidence on the voir dire:We went to the front counter and the lady was asking how can she help us and then we told her about that there was coppers looking for us and we're on the news.
27They saw Detective Fenwick and Detective Senior Constable Marino. Detective Fenwick said in his statement:""All stated they were the girls present at the scene in Parramatta as mentioned in the press release that day.""
28Detective Marino described how unexpected their arrival was in his evidence on the voir dire:""If I may say, the girls attended unannounced, sir, and we had  there was very little time to perhaps formulate any strategies or plans on how we would take a statement, what to explore.  We went downstairs pretty cold.  When I say that, I didn't expect and I know that Detective Sergeant Fenwick did not expect their presence."" 
29The officers ascertained that ZP was 14, that the accused had just turned 15 and HH was 16. They deferred questioning the girls until support persons had arrived. They found out from the accused that her sister, Fehi, who was 19, had accompanied them to the station. Police arranged for the accused's mother, LE, who was also ZP's aunt, to be collected by police and brought to the station to be a support person. LE is Tongan and her mother tongue is Tongan. She speaks and understands English.
30The accused was led upstairs from the reception area to the investigation manager's office. Once she was inside the office, the door was partly closed. When she was told, ""Don't leave the office"" and ""Stay in the office"", she believed that she was not allowed to leave. She left the office only once to call her mother, whom police required to attend to act as a support person. The accused had to wait about an hour for her mother to arrive.
31I accept the accused's evidence, including the following:Q.  . . .  Why did you answer all the questions you were asked in that interview? A.  I thought we had to cause the cops asked us questions and I thought we're supposed to answer them.
32The accused was questioned by Detective Marino who was working part-time on the task force associated with the death of Crowe. He had neither seen the media release, the media reports, nor the CCTV footage at the time he conducted the interview. He was, however, aware that there had been a media release. He did not know that the media reports had described the girls variously as persons the police were ""still trying to find"" and ""still hunting"". He knew that there was some evidence that a young girl had pointed out the deceased before Brilliantes stabbed him but he did not know that the girl was one of the three girls who presented themselves at the police station on 12 July 2012. He could not recall whether he had been told that the two girls other than the accused  had the same first names as the girls mentioned by Brilliantes in his ERISP.
33Detective Marino recalled that Detective Fenwick had asked him to find out about communication, and in particular mobile telephone communication, around the time of the stabbing. He accepted that he might have been asked to find out whether any of the girls knew that the principal offender had a knife. He also knew that he had to ask them about their clothing because he knew that there was CCTV footage of the incident although at that stage he did not know that any of the girls was depicted on CCTV.
34Senior Constable Lawler was also present at the interview that Detective Marino conducted. He did not have any involvement with the accused before the interview started. He was not aware of the media release until he was called to give evidence on the voir dire before me.
35When the accused was asked, at the commencement of the interview, why she attended the police station she said:""'Cause, um, we heard that on the news about the stabbing at, um, Parramatta. Then they said, ""Let's go to the cop, police station to tell the side of our story.""
36The accused was not cautioned and no warning was given. Detective Marino explained in evidence that she was treated as a witness rather than as a suspect.
37Detective Marino asked the accused about the difference between the truth and a lie and asked her to explain it. In the main he asked her non-leading questions about what had happened on the night of Saturday 7 and Sunday 8 July 2012. 
38The Crown relies on the following answers to questions asked in the first interview as admissions that the accused knew that Brilliantes had a knife when she tapped him on the shoulder and pointed out Crowe and that she intended that he cause Crowe grievous bodily harm:Q139. Do you know why they were coming towards your direction?A. I'm not sure. I, I only heard like all of them, it was scary and I was like scared. And then me and the girls like walked off. And then, yeah, then one of them was hitting the nice guy. And the I, um, went in front, and I was like, ""Don't hit him"", just walk away or whatever and then like, they're like, trying to hit, so I moved and then I didn't know what way to go, so I went, I followed [HH] and Sifa. And then we went towards the old station.. . .
Q142. Hit who?A. Um, one of those boys, those boys that ran down. And then they started fighting. And then, I hear one of the guys saying, um, ""He has a knife"" and then I really got scared, so then I ran towards Hayley and them. And then those boys were just looking at us and then we ran... . . .
Q156. What can you tell me about that knife?A. Um, the, out of these three boys, the tall one, yelled, ""Oh, he has a knife"" and 'cause like, I was.... . .
Q161. The tall guy said...A. ""Oh, he has a knife"". And then, um, I ran to [HH] and then we turned around and then we seen, um, one of them yell out, ""Oh, we need a ambulance"".

39At the conclusion of the interview, the accused was again asked why she decided to go to the police station that evening, to which she answered:A 188.  ""Um, [HH], um, we met up with [HH] and then, um, she's like, ""Let's go to the police station and tell them the side of our story"", 'cause she heard that, um, about the police wanting three girls about the um, murdering. And then we're like, OK. So we walked from Parramatta shops to here.""
40The investigation continued. It is not necessary to recount the details of what occurred between this time and 2 August 2012 because the Crown accepted that, when the accused was subsequently interviewed on 2 August 2012, she had been arrested and was a suspect.
41On 1 August 2012 Detective Fenwick decided to arrest the accused in relation to the homicide of Crowe. A search warrant was also obtained in relation to the house in which she lived. Detective Senior Constable Gibson and Senior Constable Lawler were responsible for executing the warrant.
42The accused was at home with her mother, her brother and two sisters while the warrant was being executed. When the officers arrived, Detective Gibson told the accused that police were ""investigating an affray and subsequent homicide of Patrick Crowe"". He told her that she was ""under arrest for that"" and told her that she did not have to say or do anything if she did not want to.
43The execution of the search warrant was filmed and sound-recorded. I viewed the segments of the record of the execution of the search warrant that were relied upon by the Crown and the accused. It was apparent from the recording of the execution of the warrant that LE spoke reasonably good conversational English. However, at the conclusion of the execution of the warrant, another police officer, Inspector Matthew Nicholas, asked her whether she had any complaints about the way in which the search was conducted. LE did not respond. He reiterated the question. Finally one of her daughters told her that she was being asked whether she liked or ""no liked"" the search warrant. I am satisfied that LE's vocabulary, while sufficient for everyday life, is not substantial and she does not understand longer words.
44While the warrant was being executed, one of the accused's sisters mentioned to one of the police officers that she had an ATAR score of 91 in the Higher School Certificate and that she wanted to go into the police force. He observed that she was ""smarter than most cops"" and suggested that she ""go and be a rocket scientist"" rather than a police officer. When she asked about the best positions in the police force, he said: ""Detectives, we're the brains of the organisation, supposedly.""
45Without consulting the accused, police selected her mother as her support person. I accept the accused's evidence that she would have preferred that one of her sisters fulfil that role because of what she believed to be their greater command of the English language and better understanding of the world.
46Detective Fenwick explained in his evidence on the voir dire that, as at 2 August 2012, the decision had not yet been made whether the accused would also be charged with murder. He said that several people had been arrested ""in relation to the murder"" who were not necessarily ultimately charged with murder. He said:""As I said before, from what we had, she obviously had a case to answer for in relation to that.  That's why she was brought back, that's what she was arrested, that's why she had to speak for it.  We were going to review it at the end of the interview also to see what determination it was.  It wasn't like she was going to be charged regardless.""  
47Police drove the accused and her mother back to Parramatta Police station. Detective Gibson took her to the charge room with her mother while Senior Constable Lawler prepared documents for the interview that he proposed to conduct. Sergeant Oakley, the Custody Manager, read out and gave the accused a copy of the ""Caution and Summary of Part 9 [of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002]"" which she signed at 11.02 am. The accused's mother was given a document entitled ""Role of Support Person"" which she signed at 11.04 am.
48The accused's lack of appreciation of what was happening is evident from her evidence generally, of which the following passage is an example:Q.  Now, when you went to the police station on 2 August, you understood you were now under arrest, didn't you? A.  When I got to the cop station and asked Oakley, yeah. Q.  What did he tell you? A.  No, 'cause I asked him, ""Am I like getting locked up or something?""  And then he told me ""yes"".  And that's when I knew, 'cause I was still confused.
49Afterwards the accused was given the opportunity to speak to a solicitor on the Juvenile Legal Aid Hotline. At 11.05 am Detective Gibson rang the hotline and was put through to Keisha Hopgood, a solicitor on duty. He told her that the charge was affray ""at the moment"". When she ascertained from him that the victim was dead she confirmed with him that there was a possibility of a murder charge. She was concerned that Detective Gibson had referred at the outset to affray, but not murder and suspected that he was not being entirely open with her. After she had spoken to him, she spoke with the accused.
50Ms Hopgood recounted on the voir dire, by reference to her detailed contemporaneous file note, the advice she gave to the accused. She told the accused that because the charge was murder she could not be dealt with by the Children's Court. She also explained the right to silence to her and impressed upon her the gravity of her situation. She advised the accused not to participate in an interview since she was facing very serious charges. She summarised her advice in the following terms:""But what I said to her, black and white, was she should not be interviewed, she not participate in an interview, she should not go on the ERISP, say no to that.  There was no grey area in a situation like this.  There is no grey area.""
51At the conclusion of the conversation the accused instructed Ms Hopgood to tell Detective Gibson that she did not want to be interviewed. Ms Hopgood asked the accused if she could speak with her support person but the accused told her that she would prefer to explain it to her mother herself.
52Ms Hopgood communicated her instructions to Detective Gibson. She told him that not only did the accused not wish to be interviewed but that she did not want to go on tape. She told him that she would sign an entry in the police notebook: ""I don't wish to be interviewed."" He responded to her suggestion by saying that he was still going to put the accused on ERISP ""in fairness so that he could put the allegations to her"". Ms Hopgood told him that the accused did not want to go on tape and he could not compel her to do so. Ms Hopgood explained her approach in the following terms:Q.  And why did you find it necessary to advise him of those things? A.  Because unfortunately we've had situations where, and again it's the same ""in fairness"" line that's been used, that the police have said they want to give a young person the opportunity to hear the allegations and to put their refusal on tape.  However, once a young person is in the interview room, allegations are put to them, pictures have been shown to them, and young persons have inadvertently, or without any further legal advice, ended up either doing a full interview or making comments, statements.  
53Ms Hopgood told Detective Gibson that she would confirm in writing that FE did not want to be interviewed and that he could not compel her refusal to be on ERISP. Ms Hopgood then spoke to the accused again. Phone records confirm that the total length of the call, which involved Ms Hopgood speaking to Detective Gibson twice and the accused twice, was 882 seconds, or almost fifteen minutes. The call concluded at about 11.20 am, according to phone records that were tendered. The timing and duration accord with the entries for communication on the Custody Management Record.
54After the telephone call, Ms Hopgood arranged for a letter to be faxed to Detective Gibson at Parramatta Police Station. The facsimile imprint recorded that the letter was received at 12.33 pm. The letter said:This letter is to confirm our telephone advice that the young person [FE] does not wish to be interviewed and does not wish to record her refusal.She will agree to sign a notebook entry that states 'I do not wish to be interviewed and I do not wish to record my refusal'.We note that Police Circular PC 05/02 states 'you do not have the power to compel or intimate to the suspect that they must participate in an electronic recorded interview for the purpose of recording their refusal. Record the refusal in your notebook...'Please ensure that no interview or recording takes place with this young person. If there is any problem or change to these instructions, then please contact the writer through the Legal Aid Youth Hotline, as any change must be confirmed through further legal advice.
55Where there is any inconsistency between the evidence of Ms Hopgood and the evidence of Detective Gibson, I prefer Ms Hopgood. I accept Ms Hopgood's evidence that she remembered this advice because of the seriousness of the accused's situation. Although she had given about a thousand hotline advices, only three of those involved a charge, or potential charge, of murder. She also had occasion to recall the conversation when she subsequently advised someone who was charged with murder. She remembered hearing later from another solicitor that, notwithstanding her advice, police had interviewed the accused. She made a detailed contemporaneous file note. She was methodical and meticulous about recording what had occurred in the hotline advice and confirming her advice by letter addressed to Detective Gibson. Detective Gibson could not recall many matters of significance. I do not accept that at the time of the interview the accused had been charged with murder. I accept that he told Ms Hopgood, as was the case before the interview on 2 August 2012, that the charge was then affray.
56Detective Gibson did not see the letter from Ms Hopgood until he checked his pigeonhole the following day.
57Detective Gibson informed neither Detective Fenwick, nor Senior Constable Lawler, nor Sergeant Oakley of what had occurred in the course of the hotline advice, nor what the accused's instructions were. 
58Most of the time while the accused was in the charge room she was some metres away from her mother and her vision of her was obscured by the fingerprinting machine.
59At about 11.20 am, shortly after the call to Ms Hopgood ended, Detective Gibson and Senior Constable Lawler escorted the accused and her mother from the charge room to an interview room. The custody management records record that this occurred at 11.34 am although the officers in their statements recall that it occurred at about 11.20 am. The accused was not given an opportunity to speak to her mother privately after speaking with Ms Hopgood. 
60On the way from the charge room to the interview room, the accused asked Detective Senior Constable Lawler: ""Where are we going?"" to which he responded, ""To the interview room"".
61The accused gave evidence that she said, ""I'm not going to the interview room because the lady on the phone told me not to"", to which Senior Constable Lawler responded, ""You have to."" 
62I am not satisfied that this exchange occurred precisely in that way and in those terms since I accept that if Senior Constable Lawler had appreciated that the accused had instructed her solicitor that she would not participate in an interview, he would not have conducted the interview other than to record that she refused to participate in it. However, I accept that the accused told Senior Constable Lawler that she did not want to go to the interview room and he told her that she had to. His response was, from his point of view, understandable, since he intended to caution her and record her response on the ERISP. He had not been privy to the conversation with Ms Hopgood and did not know that the accused did not want her response to be recorded, except in writing in a police notebook.
63I accept the accused's evidence that the only reason she did the interview was because she thought she had to, as appears from the following exchange:Q.  She told you that you didn't have to participate in an interview? A.  I know, but I'm saying  'cause I already told the copper that I didn't want to do the interview, so he told me I had to, so obviously I had to do what the police had to say.  
64I reject the Crown submission that I should infer from the advice Ms Hopgood gave that the accused understood that she had a right to silence and could exercise it and that because the accused did not insist on it again in the interview room, I should infer that she was prepare to forego it. This submission is an unattractive one. The exercise of the right to silence ought be respected and not undermined, as it was in the present case, in the expectation that its holder will be unaware of its parameters and will, as a result, be dissuaded from continuing to insist upon it.
65The Crown's submission is at odds with what I find to be the accused's limited understanding of what she was required to do and what the legal terms used meant. I accept her evidence that she did not understand several terms used in the interview, including the term ""free will"".
66Furthermore, the phone records and the time of the interview show that the accused was taken to the interview room within a very short time after the phone call with Ms Hopgood. The suggestion that she had decided, through the exercise of her free will, to change her instructions instantaneously and participate voluntarily in an interview in which she had moments before decided on legal advice not to take part, is fanciful.
67As Ms Hopgood had feared, the accused participated fully in an interview which commenced at 11.36 am and concluded at about 1 pm. She was cautioned at the commencement of the interview. At the conclusion of the interview she did not make any complaint about the interview and agreed that she had given answers of her ""own free will"".
68I am satisfied that the accused did not understand that she had a right to silence or what such a right entailed. She did not appreciate that she was entitled to refuse to answer questions. The police, by subjecting her to an interview and asking her questions, took advantage of her youth and her vulnerability and her mother's limited education and English, which ill-equipped her to protect her daughter's rights.
69The Crown relies on the following admissions made by the accused in the ERISP as tending to establish that the accused knew that Brilliantes had a knife when she tapped him on the shoulder immediately before he stabbed Crowe:Q259. That's him? Yep.A. I remember, like, he, he swung at, like, the group of boys. Like, they were, like, everywhere but I remember um, 'cause Dean was behind us, and I can remember the tall guy was on the side, like, where Nando's was. I think it was Nando's or Max Brenner. And then I um, one of the boys were in front of him and I remember he was yelling, oh, ""Knife. There's a knife"" or whatever. And then -
Q260. Who yelled that out?A. The tall guy.
Q261. Yep.A. And then in front, I think it was in front of him, like, I think, I can remember, like, what position but, like, that other guy was um, the skinny guy was punching on. And then Dean, like, Dean, like, I remember, I turned around and Dean was behind us when l put my hand up like that to one of the, to that boy. And then we ran up -
Q262. To what boy?A. The boy that was in front of me that was trying to, like, hit Dean. And then I put my hand up like that. And then I ran, like, to the side and then, like, I didn't see Dean ever since then.
Q263. O.K. You, who yelled out ""Knife""?A. The tall guy.
Q264. The tall, chubby male... with the moustache and the baseball jacket?A. Yep . . . 'Cause I was like, like, I was in front of him, I was, like, here and, like, her was, like, there.. . .
Q269. Who is this, who was carrying a knife? Did you see a knife?A. I didn't see a knife but I heard that guy say ""Knife.""
Q270. When he said, ""Knife"" what was he referring to and who was it that he was referring to?A. 'Cause, like, they were, I, I think it was, like, three boys in front of him. Yeah. And then, like, he, I think he was talking to one. I think he was talking to one or, like, swearing at one. And then, like, he goes, ""Knife, knife."". . .
Q272. O.K.  Did you know who he was talking about, who carried the knife?Did he point him out or -A. I think it was the guy that was closer to him.
70At the conclusion of the interview, the accused was told that another officer would ask her questions about the way the interview was conducted but that she was not allowed to ask him questions. I accept that the accused did not ask any because she had been told that she was not permitted to do so.

73Section 139 of the Evidence Act relevantly provides:Cautioning of persons(1)  For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if: (a)  the person was under arrest for an offence at the time, and(b)  the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who was at the time empowered, because of the office that he or she held, to arrest the person, and(c)  before starting the questioning the investigating official did not caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.(2)  For the purposes of section 138 (1) (a), evidence of a statement made or an act done by a person during questioning is taken to have been obtained improperly if: (a)  the questioning was conducted by an investigating official who did not have the power to arrest the person, and(b)  the statement was made, or the act was done, after the investigating official formed a belief that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence, and(c)  the investigating official did not, before the statement was made or the act was done, caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence.. . .
(5)  A reference in subsection (1) to a person who is under arrest includes a reference to a person who is in the company of an investigating official for the purpose of being questioned, if: (a)  the official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence that is to be the subject of the questioning, or(b)  the official would not allow the person to leave if the person wished to do so, or(c)  the official has given the person reasonable grounds for believing that the person would not be allowed to leave if he or she wished to do so.
74The term ""investigating official"" is relevantly defined as including a police officer.
75The burden of satisfying the condition that the evidence has been improperly or unlawfully obtained is on the person seeking its exclusion. If this condition is established, the party seeking to adduce the evidence bears the burden of proving facts relevant to matters in favour of its admission: Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; 83 ALJR 494 at [28] per French CJ.
76Section 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 relevantly prohibits the admission into evidence of an admission made to a member of the police force by a child unless a person responsible for the child is present. A parent is such a person.
77Part 9 of Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA) and the regulations made thereunder (LEPRA Regulations) also apply to persons under arrest. A child, defined as a person under 18 years, is a ""vulnerable person"": LEPRA Reg 24. LEPRA Reg 25 imposes an obligation on the custody manager for a vulnerable person to assist the person in exercising the person's rights under Part 9, including any right to make a telephone call to a legal practitioner. A child may not waive the right to have a support person present during an investigative procedure, including an interview: LEPRA Regs 21 and 29.
78The role of a support person for a detained person who is a child is not merely to act as an observer, but to assist and support the child, observe whether the interview is being conducted properly and fairly and identify communication problems with the child: LEPRA Reg 30.
79The custody manager is obliged to take appropriate steps to make sure that a child who is detained understands the caution, which must be given in the presence of a support person.
The first interview: 12 July 2012
80Mr Steel contended on behalf of the accused that the first interview was improperly obtained within the meaning of s 139 of the Evidence Act and that I should exclude it in the exercise of my discretion under s 138. He submitted, in the alternative, that it should be excluded under s 138. Further, he contended that it should be excluded on the grounds of unfairness under s 90 of the Evidence Act.
81As referred to above, a significant issue in the determination of this objection is whether the accused was, at the time she presented herself at Parramatta Police Station on 12 July 2012, a suspect.
82Detective Fenwick gave evidence that at that time he was not focussing on the three girls and he was concentrating on the male protagonists. He said that the CCTV footage was in a small version and that figures shown in it were not readily discernible or identifiable. Nonetheless he agreed that individual shots could be blown up and printed off on A4 paper, as occurred during the interviews referred to above, to aid identification of persons present and to reveal actions recorded in greater detail. Detective Fenwick said that when the accused, HH and ZP presented on 12 July 2012 they were treated as witnesses because they were not, at that time, suspected of any criminal offence. 
83By 12 July 2012, the police had spoken to most of the main male protagonists of whom the principal offender, Brilliantes, had made a full confession. Brilliantes had not implicated any of the girls in the killing of Crowe and had not deposed to hearing, or being influenced to stab Crowe by, the statement attributed to one of them, ""This guy, this guy"". 
84Although I accept that the main focus of the attention of the investigation was the male protagonists, I do not accept that the accused was not, as at 12 July 2012, a suspect. Both independent eyewitnesses implicated the three girls, two of whom had been identified by Brilliantes by their first names in still photographs blown up from CCTV footage. The CCTV footage available to police at the time showed that the girl who had not been named, the accused, intervened by pointing out the deceased to the principal offender shortly before he stabbed the deceased. She was therefore implicated, not only in the affray, but also, potentially, in the murder, at least if it could be proved that she knew that Brilliantes had a knife at the time she pointed out the deceased to him.
85Furthermore, Superintendent Redfern would not, in my view, have been in a better position to know the progress of the investigation than the officer-in-charge. The reports of the investigation broadcast by the television stations referred to above indicated that the girls were ""wanted"", that they were implicated, that the police were ""still hunting"" for them and that they would be ""brought to justice"". 
86As far as I am aware from the Crown's submissions and its case statement, the evidence to prove the Crown case against the accused derives from four sources:
(1)Statements made by persons who were present at the time, including independent witnesses who were at the bus stop or in the vicinity.
(2)CCTV footage taken by various cameras in Westfield Shopping Centre and at the interchange.
(3)Phone records that show calls between JV and the accused and JV and Brilliantes at relevant times.
(4)Admissions by the accused referred to above.
87The first category had been substantially completed by 12 July 2012 since the independent eyewitnesses had given statements as had Roche and Thompson and Brilliantes and Godoy had been interviewed.
88The significant CCTV footage was in the hands of the police, who had the capacity to enlarge stills to identify particular protagonists, as they had already done when interviewing Brilliantes and Godoy. 
89The evidence does not disclose what was known about the third category as at 12 July 2012. It appears that the police did not know that there had been several calls between JV and the accused since they did not have her mobile phone at that time. Police knew that JV had called Brilliantes and asked him to come to the interchange with other males for a fight. However, the police knew from eyewitnesses that at least one of the girls had been using her mobile phone to communicate with persons and had indicated her location shortly prior to the arrival of the four males at the bus stop.
90In my view, the evidence to prove the Crown case against the accused was largely in the hands of the police prior to the time of her presentation at the station on the evening of 12 July 2012. I do not accept that its significance to her criminal culpability was lost on police. Indeed, the media release made it clear that the girls were wanted in the context where they can only have been wanted as suspects. The CCTV footage tended to show that the accused (being the only one of the three not identified by name by Brilliantes) was more culpable that the other two. By simple process of elimination the police must have known, when she presented, that she was the one most likely to be charged in connection with the murder. In my view, she was, in substance, a suspect, at least in relation to affray, if not murder, and the police were obliged to treat her as such.
Section 139: the circumstances in which failure to caution leads to a statement being taken to have been improperly obtained
91The particular aspect of the accused's  ""right to silence"" that arose when she presented herself at the Parramatta police station on 12 July 2012 was the right of a person suspected of, but not charged with, an offence not to have to answer any questions and the right not to have any adverse inference drawn from silence: X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29 at [105] per Hayne and Bell JJ. Lord Mustill described the relevant immunity in R v Director of Serious Fraud Office; Ex parte Smith [1993] AC 1 at 30 as:""a specific immunity, possessed by all persons under suspicion of criminal responsibility whilst being interviewed by police officers or others in similar positions of authority, from being compelled on pain of punishment to answer questions of any kind.""
92Section 139(1) applies if a person was under arrest for an offence at the time. The accused was not under arrest until 2 August 2012. However, s 139(5) deems a person to be under arrest in certain circumstances set out in s 139(5)(a), (b) and (c), each of which is relied upon by the accused. 
93The first alternative, (a), requires proof that the person is in the company of an investigating official for the purposes of being questioned and that the official believes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the person has committed an offence that is to be the subject of the questioning.
94The accused was initially in the company of Detective Fenwick, who was an investigating official. In evidence before me he did not agree that on 12 July 2012 he believed that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the accused had committed an offence that was to be the subject of questioning. He agreed that he was aware of the provision of the Code of Practice that provides:Where someone, either in your company or by themselves, attends a station voluntarily to help you with inquiries, consider the nature of your inquiries and the likelihood that the person will be arrested. Where this is a possibility, albeit remote, take the person to the custody manager.
95The following exchange ensued in his cross-examination:Q.  Did you do that [comply with the passage of the Code set out]? A.  I didn't even consider it.  I didn't see she was a suspect.  I didn't have anything to suggest that she was. Q.  So you didn't consider that at all, whether any of the girls would be arrested? A.  That's correct.
96I accept that it may be difficult after the event accurately to recall and articulate one's belief about dynamic matters. I did not gain the impression that Detective Fenwick was doing otherwise than trying to give truthful evidence. However, the evidence against the accused prior to the interview on 12 July 2012 was essentially the same as the present Crown case, absent the record of the telephone calls between her and JV and absent her admissions that she knew that Brilliantes had a knife. The admissions were principally relevant to the offence of murder and were not required for to prove the accused's involvement in the affray which was apparent from the CCTV footage. 
97Detective Fenwick was an experienced police officer. He was aware of the legal principles that apply to joint criminal enterprises. Although he did not see the broadcasts, he was told about the media release. He knew that Brilliantes had identified two out of the three girls, who had the same first names as the girls who presented with the accused on 12 July 2012. That he specifically asked Detective Marino to find out whether the accused knew that Brilliantes had a knife is a powerful indication that Detective Fenwick had in mind that she was already implicated in the affray and would, if she had such knowledge, be implicated in the murder. Notwithstanding his evidence to the contrary, I am satisfied that Detective Fenwick believed that there was sufficient evidence that the accused had at least committed the offence of affray about which she was to be questioned.
98I am not, however, satisfied that Detective Marino believed that there was sufficient evidence that the accused had committed an offence about which she was to be questioned. He did not know that she was one of the three girls who was wanted. I accept that he did not have evidence before him to suggest that the accused was implicated in the offences of affray or murder, although, for the reasons set out above, there was such evidence and it was known to Detective Fenwick.
99Accordingly, I am satisfied of s 139(5)(a) because I am satisfied that Detective Fenwick had formed the relevant belief. 
100Even had I not been satisfied that Detective Fenwick had the relevant belief, I consider that, had he considered the evidence then available to the police against the accused, he ought to have formed the relevant belief that the evidence was sufficient to establish that the accused had committed at least the offence of affray. This alternative finding does not fulfil the requirements of s 139(5)(a). Nonetheless if he had not formed the belief, but ought to have formed the belief, I would have nonetheless considered that the evidence was improperly obtained within the meaning of s 138(1) and would have excluded it for the same reasons as are set out below.
101I am not satisfied that Detectives Fenwick or Marino would not have allowed the accused to leave the police station if she had wished to do so. She was, after all, only 15, lived with her mother and attended school. Accordingly I am not satisfied of s 139(5)(b).
102The question of reasonable grounds for the purposes of s 139(5)(c) must be assessed by reference to the context, including the age of the accused. In my view when the accused was led from the downstairs reception area of the police station and  told to wait in the office upstairs, she was given reasonable grounds for believing that she would not be permitted to leave if she wished to. Accordingly, s 139(5)(c) has been established. 
103The effect of my findings under s 139(5)(a) and (c) is that the accused is taken to have been under arrest for an offence at the time she was questioned. Detective Marino was empowered to arrest the accused when he questioned her (s 139(1)(b)) and Detective Marino did not caution the accused in the terms set out in s 139(1)(c) of the Evidence Act. Accordingly the evidence of her statements made in the interview is taken to have been obtained improperly under s 139(1) and the discretion conferred by s 138 is required to be considered.
104Evidence of statements made during the first interview is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way it has been obtained. In making that assessment I am obliged to take into account matters I consider to be relevant as well as the matters listed in s 138(3).
The probative value of the evidence and its importance in the proceedings: s 138(3)(a) and (b) of the Evidence Act
105The Crown identified two facts that it will seek to prove by the evidence to which objection has been taken: 
(1)The accused knew that Brilliantes had a knife before or at the time she tapped him on the shoulder and pointed at the accused.
(2)When the accused pointed to the deceased she foresaw the possibility that Brilliantes might kill Crowe or inflict grievous bodily harm on him.
106In both interviews the accused admitted that she heard Thompson say, ""He's got a knife"", from which her knowledge of that fact can be inferred. If the admissions are excluded, the Crown will have to prove that inference, if at all, by circumstantial evidence. I accept the Crown's submissions that the probative value of the admissions is high and that they are significant to the count of murder on the indictment.
107The accused's admissions sought to be relied upon by the Crown are, in my view, likely to be both reliable and cogent since they are statements against interest that were made in the context of the accused's telling her ""side of the story"". 
108In Bunning v Cross [1978] HCA 22; 141 CLR 54 Stephen and Aickin JJ addressed the relationship between cogency and illegality at 79:To treat cogency of evidence as a factor favouring admission, where the illegality in obtaining it has been either deliberate or reckless, may serve to foster the quite erroneous view that if such evidence be but damning enough that will of itself suffice to atone for the illegality involved in procuring it.
109Under s 138(3)(a) and (b) the probative value and importance of such evidence are mandatory relevant considerations in the weighing exercise to be undertaken in s 138(1). The countervailing factor of the nature of the illegality referred to in the passage from Bunning v Cross set out above is also relevant to the weighing exercise under s 138(1): s 138(3)(d) and (e) which is considered below.
The nature of the relevant offence: s 138(3)(c) of the Evidence Act
110The relevant offence to which the admissions are germane is murder. It is a very serious offence. There is a public interest in the perpetrators of crimes, particularly serious crimes, being charged, prosecuted and, if found guilty, convicted and punished. In R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284; 132 A Crim R 169, Spigelman CJ, Blanch J agreeing, said by reference to s 138(3)(c) at [3]:The more serious the offence, the more likely it is that the public interest requires the admission of the evidence.
The gravity of the impropriety or contravention and whether it was deliberate or reckless: s 138(3)(d) and (e) of the Evidence Act
111I respectfully adopt the following passages from R v Phung and Huynh [2001] NSWSC 115 per Wood CJ at CL:34   It may be accepted that the purpose of the legislative regime, that now applies to the interview of children, and particularly those in custody following arrest, is to protect them from any disadvantage inherent in their age, as well as to protect them from any form of police impropriety. As to the former, what is required is compliance with the procedure laid down so as to prevent the young or vulnerable accused from being overawed by the occasion of being interviewed, at a police station, by detectives who are likely to be considerably older and more experienced than they are. . . . 38   It is important that police officers appreciate that the regime now established is designed to secure ethical and fair investigations, as well as the protection of individual rights, of some significance, which attach in particular to children. Those rights, obviously, are of great importance when a child is facing a charge as serious as murder or armed robbery. 39   The provisions need to be faithfully implemented and not merely given lip service or imperfectly observed. The consequences of any failure to give proper regard to them is to risk the exclusion of any ERISP, or the product of an investigative procedure, which is undertaken in circumstances where there has not been proper compliance with the law.
112The accused was not cautioned prior to, or during, questioning. She did not know that she did not have to say anything or take part in the interview. She was not taken to the custody manager who was obliged,  since she was a vulnerable person, to assist her to exercise her legal rights. Her rights under Part 9 of LEPRA were neither read out, nor explained to her. She was not advised of the free Legal Aid Youth Hotline service. Her mother, although regarded by police as a ""support person"", did not appreciate what her role was and was not taken through the ""Role of a Support Person"" document. She was, in any event, not capable of fulfilling the role in any substantial way because of the limitations of her English vocabulary.
113I regard these improprieties as very grave. The accused's right to remain silent and not be compelled to answer questions that might tend to incriminate her in the commission of the crime of murder has been described as a ""fundamental . . . bulwark of liberty"", which is not merely a rule of evidence but a basic and substantive common law right: Reid v Howard (1995) 184 CLR 1 at 11 per Toohey, Gaudron, McHugh and Gummow JJ. In Petty v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 at 99 the plurality (Mason CJ, Deane, Toohey and McHugh JJ) described the following principle as a  ""fundamental rule of the common law"":A person who believes on reasonable grounds that he or she is suspected of having been a party to an offence is entitled to remain silent when questioned or asked to supply information by any person in authority about the occurrence of an offence, the identity of the participants and the roles which they played.
114Although the accused was, relevantly, a suspect when she presented herself at the Parramatta police station on 12 July 2012, she was not informed of her right to silence in circumstances where she believed that she was obliged to answer the questions put to her by Detective Marino. 
115The question whether the impropriety was deliberate, reckless or merely inadvertent is more difficult to answer since such a determination cannot be made without assessing the reason Detective Fenwick directed that the accused be questioned by Detective Marino about her knowledge of the knife. I am satisfied, by the relevance and materiality of her knowledge of the knife to the offence of murder as opposed to affray and the difficulty of proving her knowledge without an admission, that the direction was made for a deliberate investigative and forensic reason: namely to obtain an admission so that the the Crown could prove a case against her for murder.
116Her admissions on 12 July 2012, on which the Crown proposes to rely, were, accordingly, not voluntary in the sense that she did not make them ""in the exercise of a free choice to speak or be silent"": The King v Lee [1950] HCA 25; 82 CLR 133 at 149 per Latham CJ, McTiernan, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ. I reject the Crown's submissions that were based on the premiss that not only did the accused want her version of events to be accepted by detectives, but also that she had an awareness of her rights and a capacity to act on them. The accused's situation was wholly different from that of Sophear Em (R v Em [2003] NSWCCA 374; [2007] HCA 46; 232 CLR 67): all that she had in common with Em was that they both wanted to tell their story to police and both made admissions in the process. Unlike the accused, Em was found to be aware of his rights and be able to act on them.
117Had the accused been advised of her legal rights, then it is, in my view, highly unlikely that she would have answered any questions at all. Her avowed wish to ""tell her story"" was borne of her naivete and her ignorance both of her right to silence and the potential consequences of self-incrimination. There is no reason to suppose that she would not have accepted the advice that would almost inevitably have been given to her had she received legal advice: namely, to refuse to be interviewed. 
118To adapt the language of the plurality in The King v Lee at 159 per Latham CJ, McTiernan, Webb, Fullagar and Kitto JJ, a 15-year-old girl, whose command of English is not sophisticated and who is suspected of a serious criminal offence, may be practically helpless in the hands of an over-zealous police officer whose position of superiority is so great and so overpowering that admissions may be made which, if the girl knew her legal rights, would not be made.
The weighing exercise under s 138(1) of the Evidence Act
119I am not satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which these admissions have been obtained. Accordingly, s 138(1) requires that it not be admitted.
Section 13 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act
120The accused also relied on this section which provides that an admission made by a child is not be be admitted unless a person responsible for the child was present. This section was complied with, although LE did not appreciate the significance of her role as a support person and was not able to protect her daughter's rights, since she herself was insufficiently aware of them, and insufficiently acquainted with the terms in which to express them, to be of real assistance in their assertion.
121I do not consider that s 13 provides independent basis for the exclusion of the admissions made in the first interview. The failure to caution the accused or provide her with legal advice is of substantially greater significance than the choice of a support person.
122Furthermore, I am not satisfied that LE was an inappropriate support person, or that the accused's sisters would have been better. Many supportive, articulate adults are not conversant with the right to silence and when it applies. For the reasons given above, this is the relevant impropriety in obtaining the evidence.
Section 90 of the Evidence Act
123The test for unfairness under s 90 requires a different assessment. The provision is only to be considered after other bases for exclusion have been considered.  The onus is on the accused to establish that it would be unfair to her to use the evidence ""having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made"". In R v Swaffield [1998] HCA 1; 192 CLR 159  at [69] the plurality (Toohey,Gummow and Gaudron JJ) referred to:"". . . an overall discretion which might take account of all the circumstances of the case to determine whether the admission of the evidence or the obtaining of a conviction on the basis of the evidence is bought at a price which is unacceptable, having regard to contemporary community standards."" 
124In my view, the circumstances referred to above show that the accused was effectively deprived of the right to choose whether to speak or not, because she was ignorant of her right to silence and she was neither cautioned, nor informed, in language that she could understand, or at all, what her rights were.
125Although the admissions the accused made may well be reliable I consider the price of their admission to be too high to be worth paying since they were obtained only by failing to comply with the laws and procedures referred to above and disregarding the rights of a 15-year-old girl who was unable to look after her own interests. In the present case the ends, in my view, fall far short of justifying the means. 
126I am persuaded that, having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence. Had I not been persuaded that s 138 prohibited their admission I would have exercised my discretion under s 90 to reject the admissions made by the accused in the first interview.
The second interview: 2 August 2012
127In substance, what occurred in the second interview was that Detective Gibson acted as if the accused had not exercised her right to silence. His failure to disclose either to Sergeant Oakley or to Senior Constable Lawler the accused's instructions that Ms Hopgood had unequivocally communicated to him in the strongest possible terms is telling. I am satisfied that the accused believed, on the basis of the conduct of Detective Gibson and Senior Constable Lawler, that she was obliged to participate in the interview, although she had expressly accepted Ms Hopgood's advice that she ought not.
128Detective Gibson's cavalier attitude to the rights of the accused appears from the following exchange in cross-examination on the voir dire:Q.  Were you concerned when you saw that letter [from Ms Hopgood confirming the telephone conversation] the next day? A.  No, I wasn't concerned, no. 
Q.  Why weren't you concerned? A.  Well, from my  as I said in the past, whenever I've spoken to Juvenile Legal Aid, they've always said straightaway they don't want to be interviewed.  I always give the opportunity for anyone to be interviewed and it's ultimately up to them if they want to.  I ask her myself, in the presence of her mother, if she'd like to be interviewed to provide a version of events and to provide  and so I could give her the exact, precise allegation that she's being interviewed about or in custody for, and that's from there. 
129I regard Detective Gibson's characterisation of the proposed interview of the accused as providing an ""opportunity"" to the accused to provide a version of events as inapposite, if not disingenuous. He knew that the accused's participation in an interview would provide the police with an opportunity to prove the Crown case out of the accused's own mouth. He also knew that the accused had accepted legal advice not to answer questions or participate in an interview.
The probative value of the evidence and its importance in the proceedings: s 138(3)(a) and (b) of the Evidence Act
130For the reasons given in respect of the admissions made in the first interview, the admissions made in the second interview are highly probative and would, if admitted, be important in the proceedings. 
The nature of the relevant offence: s 138(3)(c) of the Evidence Act
131The same considerations apply as with respect to the first interview.
The gravity of the impropriety or contravention and whether it was deliberate or reckless: s 138(3)(d) and (e) of the Evidence Act
132It is improper for police investigating the commission of a crime to persist in questioning a suspect after he or she has indicated an unwillingness to answer any more questions: R v Ireland [1970] HCA 21; 126 CLR 321 at 327 per Barwick CJ.
133In R v Plevac (1995) 84 A Crim R 570, at 579-581, the Court of Criminal Appeal outlined the principles that apply when questioning a suspect. The first question is whether the suspect is willing to answer questions. If the suspect is willing to answer questions, the questioning must be fair and must not amount to undue insistence or pressure. The Court said:""Police should not persist with such an interrogation after the suspect has indicated that he or she does not wish to answer further questions... although merely because a suspect says he does not wish to answer, or will not answer, any further questions does not render inadmissible answers to further questions which the suspect does answer provided the questions are fair and proper and the answers are otherwise admissible.""
134The accused declined, through Ms Hopgood, to participate in an interview and also declined to have her refusal to answer questions filmed. The unequivocal communication of her intention was disregarded. She was led to the interviewing room in utter derogation of her right to silence. 
135I regard the contravention of the accused's rights by Detective Gibson as very grave. 
The weighing exercise under s 138(1) of the Evidence Act
136I am not satisfied that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which these admissions have been obtained. Accordingly, s 138(1) requires that the admissions not be admitted.
Section 90 of the Evidence Act
137For substantially the same reasons as given in respect of the first interview, I am persuaded that, having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions were made, it would be unfair to the accused to use the evidence obtained in the second interveiw. Had I not been persuaded that s 138 prohibited its admission I would have exercised my discretion under s 90 to reject the record of the second interview.
Summary
138For the reasons given above, I exclude the interview with the accused on 12 July 2012 and the ERISP conducted with the accused on 2 August 2012.

		18 November 2013",2013-11-11 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705865,Houri v R [2013] NSWCCA 279,"Judgment

1EMMETT JA: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed in relation to offences of aggravated armed robbery committed by him. He was sentenced in the District Court on 12 December 2012 to a total effective term of 7 years and 3 months, with a minimum custodial component of 5 years and 6 months, in respect of four offences against s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The prescribed maximum penalty under that provision is imprisonment for 25 years.

2The grounds upon which the applicant seeks to rely may be summarised as follows:




upon finding that special circumstances existed in relation to the applicant, the sentencing judge erred in the exercise of her discretion in failing to adequately reflect that finding in the overall non-parole period imposed; and

the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of disparity in the finding of special circumstances and the effective non-parole period imposed on him as compared with a co-offender.

3The applicant participated in the robberies committed at three hotels in February, April and June 2011. He pleaded guilty to two charges of aggravated robbery at one of the hotels. There were multiple offenders on each occasion. The offenders wore balaclavas and were armed with firearms or knives.

4The sentencing judge found special circumstances in relation to the applicant by reason of his age, the fact that it would be his first time in custody and the fact that he would need a substantial period under supervision in relation to rehabilitation. Her Honour, having found special circumstances in relation to the individual offences, altered the statutory ratio for each offence. In doing so, her Honour noted that the total non-parole period was very close to the statutory ratio when one has regard to the total sentence.

5It was accepted in the course of argument that this case did not involve a group of offenders participating in a common criminal enterprise, with individual offenders committing discrete offences in the course of such an enterprise. Out of the four offences for which the applicant was sentenced, only one was in common with the co-offender. There was no suggestion of any disparity between the sentences imposed.

6I have had the advantage of reading in draft form the proposed reasons of R A Hulme J. I agree, for the reasons given by his Honour, that leave to appeal should be granted, but that the appeal should be dismissed.

7R A HULME J: Essa Houri (""the applicant"") was sentenced by her Honour Judge Wells SC in the District Court at Parramatta on 12 December 2012 for four offences of aggravated armed robbery. (One of the offences was an attempt in the sense of there having been an assault with intent to rob.)

8These offences are contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years.

9For three of the offences her Honour imposed sentences of 5 years with non-parole periods of 3 years 3 months and for the fourth offence she imposed a sentence of 5 years 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months.

10There was a degree of partial accumulation of sentences such that the total effective term was one of 7 years 3 months with a minimum custodial component of 5 years 6 months.

11Related summary offences were also dealt with by her Honour (possession of ammunition without a licence and possession of a steroidal agent). The applicant was convicted but no penalty was imposed pursuant to s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW).

12The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences on the following grounds:

1. Upon finding that ""special circumstances"" did exist in the case of the Applicant the sentencing judge erred in the exercise of the sentencing discretion in failing to adequately or at all reflect the said finding in the overall non parole period imposed.

2. The Applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity in the finding of ""special circumstances"" and the effective non-parole period imposed on him as compared to his co-offender Mouhamed Elabdallah.

Facts

13Given the nature of the proposed grounds of appeal it is unnecessary to review the facts of the offences in any great detail.

14A series of robberies in licensed premises in the Sydney metropolitan area were investigated by police. It was found that there were a number of similarities: they were predominantly committed in the early hours of the morning as hotel staff conducted closing procedures; they usually involved two or three persons armed with handguns; and emergency access points were breached before staff were confronted. These circumstances indicated to investigating police that ""inside information"" concerning security measures and cash handling procedures at each hotel was being used by the offenders. Some of the offenders were found to be licensed security guards.

15The applicant participated in robberies committed at three hotels: the Greenacre Hotel on 27 February 2011; the Bull and Bush Hotel at Baulkham Hills on 28 April 2011 and the Cedars Tavern at Emerton on 14 June 2011. 

16The applicant pleaded guilty to two charges of aggravated armed robbery in relation to the Greenacre incident. There was a robbery of personal property from a security guard and a robbery of $2000 of hotel takings from the manager. On this occasion the three offenders each wore balaclavas and they were armed with one firearm and two knives. The applicant's co-offenders were Mohamad Kouzi and Shadi Salameh.

17The Bull and Bush Hotel robbery involved three offenders. Two of them, the applicant and Mouhamed Elabdallah, entered the hotel while the applicant's brother, Moussa Houri, waited outside. The offenders wore hooded jumpers and black balaclavas. The applicant was armed with a tomahawk and Elabdallah was armed with a pistol. They left without taking anything when they were told that the cash could not be accessed due to a time lock on the safe. The usual hotel takings on that night of the week averaged $50,000.

18The Cedars Tavern robbery involved five offenders. Two of them, the applicant and Elabdallah, entered the hotel, both armed with handguns and wearing balaclavas. They took $50,000 in cash from the office while the manager was hiding in the toilet out of fear. 

19The applicant was arrested on 26 August 2011 and remained in custody thereafter.

Personal circumstances of the applicant

20The applicant was aged 19 at the time of the offences. His upbringing was marred by episodes of domestic violence between his parents who separated in about 2006. This was said to have had an emotional impact upon him during his formative years but he maintained a close relationship with both parents.

21The applicant had no criminal history to speak of. The judge noted that his custodial disciplinary record since his arrest was ""not ideal"".

22There were a number of matters identified in the applicant's subjective case that the judge described as ""significant"". The first was that he was involved in a motor vehicle accident in December 2009 in which he sustained significant injuries and was hospitalised. He was left with a crush fracture of a lumbar vertebra and chronic lower back pain.

23The applicant gave an inconsistent account about illicit drug use that the judge could not accept, although she said that it seemed likely he was using illicit drugs at some stage.

24Dr Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, diagnosed the applicant with a depressive illness, in remission; anxiety disorder, also in remission; and substance abuse disorder. The judge observed:

Overall, Dr Nielssen felt that those underlying psychiatric matters were likely to have been a contributing factor to his offending behaviour. That matter will be taken into account in terms of consideration of his subjective background. In terms of it going to a question of affecting his judgment and his moral culpability, those matters would be given only the slightest weight in this particular matter. He was well aware of the effect of drugs upon him, and he was also well aware that he would be able to get professional help.

25The final ""significant"" matter related to ""the incarceration of [the applicant's] older brother in relation to a murder offence and his significant illness and death subsequent to the commission of these armed robbery offences"". The judge accepted that this had a significant effect upon him.

The judge's assessment of sentence

26The judge considered the guideline range of sentence of 4 to 5 years for the typical armed robbery case described in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346. She noted the higher maximum penalty for the offence of aggravated armed robbery and observed that each of the applicant's offences were ""much more serious than those considered in Henry"". In relation to the latter she referred to the considerable amount of planning involved in the applicant's offences and that there were co-offenders involved.

27Her Honour regarded the fourth offence as more serious because it was preceded by three others; the applicant actually held a handgun and there were two guns involved; the applicant was instrumental in the preparation for the offence; the proceeds were $50,000; and the car used by the offenders was later burnt.

28The issue of finding special circumstances, thus allowing the judge to impose a non-parole period that was less than the usual three-quarters of the head sentence is the subject of the first ground of appeal and so I will quote what the judge said about it in full:

In passing sentence I propose to find special circumstances which will reduce the statutory ratio substantially for each of the four offences, though on the overall total sentence the statutory ratio will not reduce substantially. That will be done because there is already a considerable reduction for each of the individual offences, of the statutory ratio. Furthermore, the offender will spend a substantial period of time on parole once the custodial period has ended. The reasons for finding special circumstances are: his age; that it is his first time in custody; and that he will need that substantial period under supervision in relation to his rehabilitation.

29After she had pronounced the sentences, her Honour returned to the issue of special circumstances:

Again, I find special circumstances in relation to the individual offences and alter the statutory ratio, though I note that the total non-parole period is very close to the statutory ratio when one has regard to the total sentence, and that is what I intend in passing the sentence.

Ground 1 - error in not reflecting the finding of special circumstances in the overall sentence

30It was submitted for the applicant that despite her Honour foreshadowing that the finding of special circumstances would reduce the statutory ratio for each of the four offences, the end result was that the applicant was sentenced to an overall sentence with a non-parole period that actually exceeded the statutory ratio.

31Reference was made to a variety of matters, some adverted to by the judge and some not, which would have justified a reduction of the non-parole component of the overall sentence.

32Cases referred to by the applicant included those where sentencing judges had indicated an intention to find special circumstances so as to allow an offender a longer period of parole supervision but, through inadvertence or miscalculation in the process of accumulating sentences, did not impose an overall sentence that gave effect to that intention.

Determination of Ground 1

33There is no merit in this ground. Whilst there were factors that could have justified a reduction in the non-parole component of the overall sentence, they did not mandate that the judge should do so. It cannot be said that it was not open to the judge in the exercise of her sentencing discretion to impose a non-parole component that was about three-quarters (it was a fraction over 75 per cent) of the overall term. 

34I do not believe that there was any inadvertence or miscalculation by the judge. She imposed individual sentences and partially accumulated them to achieve the precise result that she said she intended. In the first passage quoted above she said that the in the overall total sentence ""the statutory ratio will not reduce substantially"". In the second passage she noted that ""the total non-parole period is very close to the statutory ratio when one has regard to the total sentence, and that is what I intend in passing sentence"". 

35It is clear that the judge appreciated what the end result was because after announcing the individual sentences and before making the second of the statements I have quoted she said:

So what that means is, your total term is seven years and three months, expiring on 25 November 2018. The total non-parole is five years and six months and dates from 26 August 2011 to 25 February 2017, which is your earliest release date.

36This case is very different to the types of cases referred to on the applicant's behalf: see, for example, the discussion of this issue in Caristo v R [2011] NSWCCA 7 at [33]-[37]. 

37I believe that leave to appeal should be granted in respect of this ground, despite its ultimate lack of success. Her Honour's approach in finding special circumstances in relation to each of the individual sentences is somewhat puzzling. Given that the effect of the sentence structure was what she intended, there was only utility in finding special circumstances in relation to the last of the sentences to be served so as to preserve the equivalent of the statutory proportion in the overall result. The only explanation I can think of for her Honour's approach is that she recognised that there were factors that could have amounted to special circumstances, but that in the exercise of her discretion she did not consider it appropriate to give effect to such a finding in the overall sentence.

Ground 2 - parity in relation to the co-offender Elabdallah

Sentencing of Mouhamed Elabdallah

38Mouhamed Elabdallah was sentenced by his Honour Judge Sides QC after the applicant had been sentenced. He had pleaded guilty to offences of aggravated armed robbery at the Cedars Tavern at Emerton on 14 June 2011; conspiring to commit an aggravated armed robbery on the Crown Hotel at Revesby; aggravated armed robbery at the Brewhouse at Lalor Park; and aggravated armed robbery at the El Toro Hotel at Warwick Farm.

39Whilst the agreed facts tendered in the applicant's case indicated that Elabdallah was involved in the Bull and Bush Hotel robbery, the only charge they had in common related to the Cedars Tavern robbery.

40In sentencing Elabdallah for his offences Judge Sides took into account some further offences listed on a Form 1 document (Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). These were three offences of aggravated kidnapping which arose from the offenders in the Brewhouse and El Toro Hotel offences having tied up some victims.

41In the context of discussing parity with Elabdallah's co-offenders, Judge Sides considered the sentencing of the applicant in relation to the Cedars Tavern robbery and Milad Salama in relation to the Brewhouse robbery and being an accessory after the fact to the Cedars Tavern robbery. He assessed relevant similarities and dissimilarities and stated that he was applying the principle of parity in relation to the robberies at those two venues. 

42Judge Sides imposed an aggregate sentence upon Mr Elabdallah of 9 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 6 years. He indicated that if he had imposed individual sentences, he would have imposed a sentence for the Cedars Tavern robbery of 5 years 6 months.

Submissions for the applicant

43It was pointed out in submissions for the applicant that the aggregate sentence imposed upon Elabdallah involved a non-parole period that was 63 per cent of the overall sentence. This was to be contrasted with the almost 76 per cent proportion in the sentencing of the applicant. It was contended that the nature of the offending of the two men was sufficiently similar that the applicant was left with a justifiable sense of grievance that warranted the intervention of this Court.

44No authorities were cited in the submissions for the applicant. But in the light of two cases to which the Crown drew to the Court's attention (see below), it was conceded that in relation to a ground of appeal of this nature, there must ""as much as possible"" be a comparison of ""apples with apples"". It was submitted that there were sufficient similarities in the two cases to justify such a comparison and to give rise to the sense of grievance asserted.

Determination of Ground 2

45It was conceded in the course of oral submissions that this was not a case of a group of offenders participating in a common criminal enterprise with individual offenders committing discrete offences in the course of such an enterprise: see, for example, Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; 77 NSWLR 540; and Henderson v R [2012] NSWCCA 65. As a result parity, or proportionality, does not arise for consideration in relation to the overall offending and the overall sentences imposed. 

46Out of the four offences for which the applicant was sentenced, only one was in common with the co-offender Elabdallah. He received a sentence (indicatively) for the Cedars Tavern robbery of 5 years 6 months, whereas the applicant's head sentence for that robbery was one of 5 years. There was no complaint (nor could there be) about this disparity.

47Even if parity, or proportionality, was a relevant issue in relation to the applicant and Elabdallah, the problem for the applicant is that his sentencing, and that of Elabdallah, proceeded upon a substantially different factual basis, both in terms of the offences for which they were to be sentenced and in terms of their respective subjective cases. An argument that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance in that a finding of special circumstances was reflected in the overall sentence imposed upon Elabdallah and not in his own case must, for that reason, also fail. 

48The two cases to which the Crown drew attention amply support this proposition. In R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209, Howie J (with whom Studdert and Latham JJ agreed), after referring to what he had said in an earlier case, stated:

[19] I maintain the view that I expressed in those passages that generally disparity does not arise simply from the fact that a finding of special circumstances was made in respect of one co-offender but not in respect of the other. I am prepared to accept that there may be a case where, all relevant facts and circumstances being equal, a finding of special circumstances in the case of one offender but not in the other may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. But in the present case not all things were equal because of the different findings made in respect of the criminality of the two offenders and the appropriate head sentences.

49The other case to which the Crown referred, Lau v R [2010] NSWCCA 43, provided an example of a situation when the parity principle could be invoked because of what were considered to be the ""indistinguishable"" personal circumstances of the applicant and his co-offender. McClellan CJ at CL (with whom James and Davies JJ agreed) endorsed (at [15]) Howie J's proposition in R v Do that ""there may be cases where all relevant facts and circumstances being equal, a finding of special circumstances in the case of one offender and not in the other may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance"". 

50In present case there was no equality of ""all relevant facts and circumstances"". So, even if there could be a legitimate comparison of the sentences imposed upon the applicant and upon Elabdallah, there is no legitimate basis for the applicant to have a sense of grievance that special circumstances were found in Elabdallah's case but not his own.

Orders

51I propose the following orders:

1. Leave to appeal granted.

2. Appeal dismissed.

52BELLEW J: I agree with R A Hulme J.

2705867,Diaz v R [2013] NSWCCA 277,"Judgment

1MACFARLAN JA: I agree with Button J.

2ADAMS J: I agree with Button J.

3BUTTON J: On 20 October 2008, his Honour Judge Bennett SC sentenced Rodrigo Philip Diaz (""the applicant"") in the District Court of New South Wales at Parramatta for 14 offences. I shall recount the details of them shortly, but in summary they were offences of violence, including sexual violence, detention, and damage to property. The victim with regard to all offences was a woman with whom the applicant had been in an intimate relationship. His Honour imposed a total head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years 2 months, with a total non-parole period of 9 years 1 month. The applicant seeks leave to appeal against those sentences.

4It is immediately noteworthy that the sentences were imposed over four and a half years before the hearing of the application for leave to appeal. The Crown submitted with some force that leave to appeal out of time should be refused. I shall discuss that issue later in my judgment.

Procedural background

5The history of the matter in the District Court was long and complicated.

6The offences were alleged to have been committed over two periods of time. The first set of offences occurred in the suburb of Randwick between 20 and 23 January 2005. The second set of offences occurred in the suburb of Glebe between 27 January and 1 February 2005.

7The applicant first appeared for trial in November 2005. On that occasion he pleaded guilty to two offences. The first was count 1 on the indictment presented at that stage, an allegation of malicious damage to a mobile phone of the victim. For the purpose of differentiation, I shall refer to that count as ""the earlier count 1"". The second was count 4 on the indictment presented at that stage, an allegation that the applicant maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the victim. Again, I shall refer to that count as ""the earlier count 4"". For reasons that do not need to be explored, that trial ended without verdicts on the remaining counts.

8The applicant appeared for trial a second time in April 2006. He maintained his pleas of guilty to the two counts discussed above. The jury was discharged after some days, and a further jury empanelled in a third trial. Again, the applicant maintained his two pleas of guilty. He was acquitted on one count that will not be further discussed. The jury was unable to agree with regard to the remaining counts.

9At the fourth trial in November 2006, the applicant was found guilty of count 7 on the indictment then in existence. That was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against the victim. Again, for the purposes of differentiation, I shall refer to that count as ""the earlier count 7"". The jury was unable to agree with regard to the remaining counts.

10The fifth and final trial commenced on 12 June 2007. There were 11 counts on the indictment, and the jury returned a verdict of guilty with regard to each of them.

11In short, it was incumbent upon his Honour to sentence the applicant for the 11 offences of which he had been found guilty in the fifth and final trial; the two offences to which the applicant had pleaded guilty in November 2005; and a single count of which the applicant had been found guilty in the fourth trial of November 2006.

12It is convenient to record at this stage that, in the final trial, evidence was led by the Crown of the acts that underpinned the two counts to which the applicant had pleaded guilty many months before.

Overview of offences and objective aspects

13In summary, the applicant subjected the victim to two extended episodes of criminality that are remarkable for their brutality and viciousness, even by the standards of the matters that come before this Court.

14The applicant and the victim had met in a shopping centre in which they were both employed in September 2004. They became friendly and then romantically involved. At first the applicant treated her tenderly, and the relationship progressed to the point of discussions of marriage and children. They maintained separate living arrangements, the applicant in an apartment in Glebe, and the victim in her own apartment in Randwick.

15In early 2005, however, the atmosphere changed. The applicant began to express jealousy about past intimate relationships of the victim. He became suspicious and invaded her privacy. Arguments ensued, and the relationship became stormy.

16On 15 January 2005, the applicant and the victim had spent the night together at her apartment in Randwick. Whilst she was away the next day, the applicant looked through her photo albums and found pictures of her with other men. Upon her return he verbally abused her, including referring to her as a ""slut"". Shortly after that he settled down, apologised, and acknowledged to the victim that he had an ""anger problem"".

17During the following week, things between them were unsettled. The applicant accused the victim of seeing other men behind his back. Again, he apologised. It is not clear whether during that week he attended a counsellor with regard to his emotional issues.

18On 21 January 2005, the flatmate of the victim was away. The applicant and the victim were alone in her apartment in Randwick. They enjoyed dinner and a drink on the balcony overlooking the swimming pool that was part of the apartment complex. The mood soured when the victim found the applicant manipulating her mobile phone in order to see the details of calls that had been made and received. As a result of the victim confronting the applicant about his behaviour, he threw her telephone into the swimming pool, and cut up the SIM card.

19That conduct constitutes the earlier count 1 (to which the applicant pleaded guilty). That was an offence of malicious damage, brought pursuant to s 195(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. There was no standard non-parole period.

20Shortly afterwards, the applicant proceeded to become intoxicated. He began to abuse the victim, including referring to her as a ""whore"". She retreated into the bathroom, and from there heard the applicant respond verbally to a photograph he found on her laptop of another man. When he appeared in the bathroom holding that computer, she explained that it was a photograph of a former boyfriend. The applicant smashed the laptop against the sink and also onto the floor. He then threw it at the applicant, and it struck her on her left thigh.

21The damage to the laptop founds count 1. That was another offence of malicious damage, brought pursuant to s 195(a) of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. There was no standard non-parole period. 

22The striking of the thigh of the victim with the laptop thrown by the applicant founded count 2. It was a charge alleging assault occasioning actual bodily harm, brought pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for that offence was imprisonment for 5 years. No non-parole period was prescribed. 

23The applicant picked up the broken pieces of the laptop and placed them in a plastic bag. He threw it at the victim, the sharper pieces of the broken item causing her pain on impact. The applicant commenced to hit the victim about the head with his hands. He then threatened her with being ""put in a wheelchair"", and threatened her family and friends with death if she were to inform anyone of his conduct. As result of those threats, the victim promised not to inform anybody about his behaviour.

24Thereafter he struck her with his fists, and kicked her about the head. When she cried out in fear and pain, he threatened to hit her ""so that she would not be able to scream anymore.""

25At one stage the applicant went to the bathroom. The victim took the opportunity to try to leave. The applicant left the bathroom, intercepted her, struck her, and ordered her to sit on the lounge. The detention of the victim continued until the applicant saw fit to take her to a hospital sometime later in order to obtain treatment for the injuries that he had inflicted upon her.

26The conduct of the applicant of detaining the victim for an extended period and inflicting a multitude of injuries upon her founds count 3 in the indictment, a charge of detaining for advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm. That was an offence contrary to s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act and the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 20 years. Again, there was no standard non-parole period. 

27The applicant then informed the victim that he would show her what he was capable of. He obtained a fish that the victim had recently purchased for her home aquarium. Despite her pleas, he squeezed that pet to death in front of her. He turned off the power to the aquarium in which the remaining fish were living.

28The applicant continued with the beating of the victim from time to time. Her jaw became painful and swollen, and she was unable to open and close her mouth properly. Later treatment in hospital confirmed that the applicant had broken the jaw of the victim.

29That conduct founds the earlier count 4 (to which the applicant pleaded guilty). That was an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm pursuant to s 35(1)(b) of the Crimes Act (as at 21 January 2005), and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years. There was no applicable standard non-parole period for this offence at the time that the offence was committed. 

30Things reached a point where the victim lost consciousness. When she came to her senses, she was suffering from a degree of amnesia and disorientation. She was also suffering from pain in one hip, the leg that had been struck by the computer, her ribs, and her arms (quite apart from her jaw).

31The applicant forced the victim to accompany him to the bedroom. He began to hit her again and pull her hair. He cut up some foreign currency that was in her possession. He smashed her watches and a camera. The latter had to be smashed a number of times against the wall before it broke.

32The destruction of the camera constitutes count 4 in the indictment. Again, that was a count of malicious damage, brought pursuant to s 195(a) of the Crimes Act, and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. No standard non-parole period was prescribed for that offence. 

33The applicant ordered the victim to sit on the lounge again. He remarked that it would be impossible for her to go to work in her current condition, and that no one must see the injuries that she had sustained. When she informed him that she needed medical help, his response was that that would inevitably lead to the involvement of the police. Instead he suggested that the victim would simply have to wait until the bruising had disappeared.

34The applicant locked the victim in the bedroom with him, and piled suitcases against the door in order to forestall her escape. She was ordered to sleep on the side of the bed furthest from the bedroom door. The applicant informed the victim that if she sought to leave he would ""smash"" her.

35The following morning, 22 January 2005, the applicant was, at times, regretful. On other occasions, he reverted to jealousy, searching the apartment for items of property that he believed were connected with past relationships of the victim with an eye to destroying them. He forced the victim to write a note dictated by himself informing her flatmate that she and the applicant had travelled to Byron Bay for a week or two, and that she could not be contacted on her own phone.

36By this stage the victim was dizzy, weak, and limping as result of her injuries. The applicant forced her to drive him in her motor vehicle to his apartment at Glebe. By then he was apologising for the injuries he had inflicted and her appearance generally.

37Once inside the apartment at Glebe, the applicant tended to the injuries of the victim, and washed her face. He went so far as to telephone a help line, and confessed that he had attacked his girlfriend and left her ""covered in bruises"". On the other hand, despite the obvious need for the victim to receive medical attention, the applicant refused to take her anywhere until under cover of darkness. He forced her to agree that the story she would provide was that she had fallen down stairs whilst intoxicated. They travelled to the emergency department of Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown. Out of fear, the victim complied with the orders of the applicant that she should mislead the medical staff. 

38The victim was able to inform some friends and relatives by telephone of the truth. Others were provided with the lie manufactured by the applicant. A doctor who examined the victim rejected the story she told and encouraged her to see a social worker.

39The doctor who examined the victim at that stage - that is, after the first episode - noted a large number of injuries. Her face and scalp were grossly swollen and bruised. There were many injuries in and around her eyes and mouth. There were a large number of bruises to her face and ears. Her eyes were almost swollen shut, and her jaw was broken, as was her nose. Her legs, wrists, and upper arms were bruised. 

40In summary, the treating doctor said that he was shocked by the extent of the swelling of the face and scalp of the victim, and it was so severe that he was unable to distinguish her facial features. 

41On 24 January 2005 the victim underwent surgery for her broken jaw. Amongst other things, that required the insertion of 30 sutures to the mouth of the victim. 

42On 26 January 2005, the applicant visited the victim in hospital. Whilst they were watching television together, he asked her whether she was a prostitute, and thereafter left her in the ward alone, remarking that he was unsure whether he would return. And yet the following day, 27 January 2005, the applicant returned to the hospital, and took the victim to his home in Glebe. The second ordeal of the victim was about to commence.

43That evening, the applicant ordered the victim to remove the navel ring that she was wearing. He stated that if she did not remove it herself he would ""rip it out"". In response to his questioning, she informed him that she had purchased it whilst in the company of a male friend. He proceeded to grab the victim by the throat and choke her. He punched her in the throat with a closed fist and grabbed her forcibly by her broken jaw. As one would expect, that act of the applicant caused the victim extreme pain. He remarked that he should ""break her jaw again"".

44The blow to the throat and the grabbing of the jaw of the victim founds the earlier count 7 (of which the applicant had been found guilty at a previous trial). That was an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. Again, there was no prescribed standard non-parole period for this offence. 

45The next morning, 28 January 2005, the applicant was affectionate. The victim was responsive in order to avoid further violence. For a time the applicant was not aggressive. However, whilst driving to a cafe in Randwick in the company of the applicant, the victim saw a male friend of hers crossing the road in front of them. The victim and that friend made eye contact, and the applicant noticed it. He abused her in the usual offensive terms, and they returned to the apartment in Glebe. There the applicant informed the victim that he would demonstrate ""what he was capable of"".

46The applicant produced what appeared to the victim to be an extendable baton. He struck the victim repeatedly with that weapon to her legs, her body, and across her feet. The victim was in great pain. The blows from the baton were delivered with sufficient force to cause the skin of the victim to split at more than one location.

47Separately, the applicant stamped on the hand of the victim whilst wearing shoes, breaking her fingers.

48The victim was originally ordered to sleep on the floor. Eventually the applicant permitted her to sleep in bed with him. The following morning, 29 January 2005, he inspected her injuries and remarked ""Jesus, you look terrible.""

49The victim was dizzy and passed out. When she regained consciousness the applicant proceeded to beat once again. Thereafter she submitted to penile/vaginal sexual intercourse. He penetrated the victim from behind, causing her internal pain. Thereafter he beat her again.

50That sexual intercourse founds count 6 in the indictment, an offence of sexual intercourse without consent. That charge was brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Pursuant to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, a standard non-parole period of 7 years was prescribed for that offence. 

51The applicant at one stage remarked to the victim ""Look at you. You're so old and stained and wrinkly. All these men, they had you before. Why should I have you now?"" Later he ordered the victim to stop bleeding on his property. Later again, he threatened to slice her genitals in half so that she would not be attractive to other men in future.

52During the night, the applicant awoke, and he and the victim had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse again. That act founds count 7 in the indictment. That was an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years applied. 

53The following day was Sunday, 30 January 2005.

54The beatings with the baton continued. At one stage the two of them travelled outside so that the applicant could use a public phone to order a pizza delivery. They returned to the flat, watched a video, and the beating recommenced. On enquiry from the victim as to whether he intended to kill her, the applicant replied that it was ""not worth it to do so"".

55Before retiring for the evening, the applicant requested that the victim bring him to ejaculation. She sought to use her hands (including the hand with the broken fingers) and her mouth to do so. However the attempt of the applicant to penetrate her mouth with his penis failed. That was because the state of her jaw made penetration impossible. Eventually, the applicant and the victim had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse.

56The attempted fellatio constitutes count 8 in the indictment. That was an offence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent, brought pursuant to s 61P of the Crimes Act, and a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years was prescribed. Because the offence was an attempt, there was no standard non-parole period. 

57The penile/vaginal sexual intercourse founds count 9 in the indictment. Again, that was brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act and carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. Again, a standard non-parole period of 7 years was prescribed for that offence. 

58The following day was Monday, 31 January 2005. The applicant continued to beat the victim, albeit not with a weapon. At one stage his mood changed and he seemed to the victim to become more caring. She was told to take a shower and clean her hair, which was matted with blood. After the shower, the applicant ordered her to lie on the bed. He said ""Stop. Lie on the bed. I want to fuck you once more. This is all you are good for."" The applicant then had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with the victim without her consent. This act underpins count 10, which was brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act. It carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 

59The applicant then had penile/anal intercourse with the victim without her consent. He expressed his disgust with the process and withdrew from her body. This crime left the victim bleeding from the anus. That conduct founds count 11, which was again brought pursuant to s 61I of the Crimes Act. It had a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. 

60The ordeal of the victim came to an end in the following circumstances. The applicant searched for clothes that would hide her injuries. His mood was volatile, and at one stage in the context of abusing her he spat on her. He made a threat to kill one of her friends. They left the flat together, and eventually the applicant permitted the victim to drive off on her own. A friend assisted her to go to the police. An ambulance was called, and she remained in hospital for two weeks.

61As one would expect, the injuries of the victim recorded at that location were extensive. When seen initially she complained of severe pain to her head, throat, chest, forearms, one hand, and both legs. There was bruising to her face, and to her neck (consistent with choking), and some bruises were of various ages. Her nose was broken into multiple parts. She had fractures in one of her feet. Her ribs were tender. There was bruising and swelling to her arms, consistent with defensive injuries. There was also at least one splitting injury to her skin of the kind to which I referred earlier, caused by the use of the baton with great force. As discussed earlier, the fingers of one hand were broken. They were a great many bruises to her limbs. She required surgery to her nose, and to her fingers. 

62Finally, to complete the picture of the objective features of the offence, a victim impact statement provided to his Honour described the effects that the offences had had upon her. As one would expect, the ordeals of the victim had led to long-standing and severe psychological consequences.

63The profound objective gravity of the behaviour of the applicant requires no elaboration by me. Mere recital of its attributes and consequences is sufficient. 

Subjective aspects

64As I indicated, save for the two offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty, all of the matters were resolved by way of the verdicts of juries. In the final trial, a defence that the injuries inflicted upon the victim were a result of a shared predilection for sadomasochism was rejected.

65The proceedings on sentence were extremely protracted. That was chiefly because an effort was made on behalf of the applicant to demonstrate that his behaviour had been the unforeseen side-effect of him taking medication that had been prescribed to the victim. A number of psychiatrists were called and cross-examined with regard to that issue. Ultimately, in the remarks on sentence, his Honour rejected the proposition that any aspect of the behaviour of the applicant could be sheeted home to prescription medication. That finding of fact is not impugned in this appeal.

66In a psychological report that was tendered on behalf of the applicant in the proceedings on sentence, it was recorded that the applicant conceded that, at the time of the offences, he had been abusing a number of prohibited drugs, including methylamphetamine in crystal form, commonly known as ice.

67The applicant was aged 28 years when he stood for sentence. He was born in Chile and came to this country at an early age. Domestic violence perpetrated by his father against his mother marred his upbringing. Although there had been some abuse of drugs and alcohol by the applicant in the past, his Honour did not regard it as being of great moment. His Honour found that there was no sign of mental illness or ""significant emotional disturbance"". 

68With regard to education and employment, the applicant left school after completing year 10 at the age of 16 years. He later completed the senior years of high school at the age of 18 years. The applicant found employment as a painter and interior decorator for a period of 2 years. Thereafter the applicant recounted an employment history that featured casual employment in the hospitality industry. 

69Speaking generally about the subjective case, his Honour noted that the applicant had not given evidence on sentence, making it difficult to come to firm findings of fact.

70The criminal record of the applicant was noteworthy. The facts of a number of offences appearing in it were placed before his Honour.

71In May 1999, the applicant was convicted in the Local Court of common assault, maliciously damaging property, and being armed with intent to enter a building and commit a misdemeanour. For those offences, he received community service orders.

72The facts of those offences were as follows. One evening the applicant sought access to his young daughter from a previous de facto partner. The partner refused to permit the applicant to see his child. His response was to attend her home with a meat cleaver, smash several windows to force entry, and enter the kitchen. The applicant threatened his de facto with the meat cleaver, and cut the telephone cable when an effort was made to alert the authorities. Eventually, the applicant was disarmed and no one was injured.

73In April 2003, the applicant was convicted again of maliciously damaging property. He was sentenced to periodic detention for 6 months. An appeal later in the year led to a suspended sentence being imposed. A condition of the bond of the suspended sentence was that the applicant undertake rehabilitation with regard to alcohol, and address anger management issues.

74The background to that incident was that the applicant had got into an argument with a motorist whilst both of them were still in their respective vehicles. The applicant then alighted from his vehicle and caused substantial damage to the door of the other motor vehicle by kicking it.

75In April 2004, the applicant was once again convicted in the Local Court of maliciously damaging property. Again, he was given the benefit of a suspended sentence. Conditions of the bond included that he obey reasonable directions with regard to drug and alcohol rehabilitation.

76The background of that offence is that, during the course of a social gathering, the applicant became aggressive and started threatening one of the guests. The threats escalated into a physical confrontation, and the host of the social gathering contacted the brother and mother of the applicant. The mother and brother of the applicant eventually attended the gathering and tried to resolve the situation. However, the applicant pushed his mother, causing her to fall. The younger brother of the applicant, who was a child, sought to calm things, but he was also threatened by the applicant. The mother, brother and other people present retreated into the premises of the social gathering, whilst the applicant returned to his family home. There the applicant proceeded to damage one of the interior walls of the family home with a knife. 

Sentence structure

77Annexed to this judgment is a diagram that seeks to show the structure of the sentences imposed by his Honour in a readily comprehensible form. 

78I shall discuss the sentences in the order of the position that they occupy within that structure.

79For the earlier count 1, a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months to commence on 31 January 2005 and expire on 30 July 2005 was imposed.

80For the earlier count 4, a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years to commence on 31 January 2005 with a non-parole period of 3 years was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 January 2008 and the balance of term expired on 30 January 2009. 

81For count 1, a fixed term of imprisonment for 12 months to commence on 31 January 2005 and to expire on 30 January 2006 was imposed. 

82For count 4, a fixed term of imprisonment for 8 months to commence on 31 January 2005 and expire on 30 September 2005 was imposed. 

83For count 2, a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years to commence on 31 January 2005 with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 July 2006 and the balance of term expired on 30 January 2007 (his Honour made a slight error with regard to pronouncement, but nothing turns on it). 

84For count 3, a head sentence of imprisonment for 8 years to commence on 31 July 2005 with a non-parole period of 6 years was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 July 2011 and the balance of term expired on 30 July 2013.

85For the earlier count 7, a head sentence of imprisonment for 3 years 4 months to commence on 31 January 2006 with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 July 2008 and the balance of term expired on 30 May 2009. 

86For count 6, a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years 4 months to commence on 31 January 2006 with a non-parole period of 7 years was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 January 2013 and the balance of term will expire on 30 May 2015. 

87For count 7, a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years 4 months to commence on 31 January 2006 with a non-parole period of 7 years was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 January 2013 and the balance of term will expire on 30 May 2015. 

88For count 8, a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years to commence on 31 January 2006 with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 July 2013 and the balance of term will expire on 30 January 2016. 

89For count 9, a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years 4 months to commence on 31 January 2006 with a non-parole period of 7 years was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 January 2013 and the balance of term will expire on 30 May 2015. 

90For count 10, a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years 4 months to commence on 31 January 2006 with a non-parole period of 7 years was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 January 2013 and the balance of term will expire on 30 May 2015. 

91For count 11, a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years to commence on 31 January 2006 with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months was imposed. The non-parole period expired on 30 July 2013 and the balance of term will expire on 30 January 2015. 

92Finally, for count 5, a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years 8 months to commence on 31 July 2006 with a non-parole period of 7 years 7 months was imposed. The non-parole period will expire on 28 February 2014 and the balance of term will expire on 30 March 2017.

93A number of aspects of the sentence structure are noteworthy.

94First, all of the offences committed at Randwick were concurrent with each other, in the sense that they all have the same commencement date, 31 January 2005. The only exception to that is count 3, the offence founded upon detention, which commences 6 months later.

95Secondly, all of the Glebe offences are concurrent with each other, in the sense that they all commence on 31 January 2006. Again, the exception to that is count 5, the offence founded upon detention, which commences 6 months later on 31 July 2006.

96In other words, it could be said that the period in custody solely referable to the entirety of the criminality evidenced at Randwick is nothing more than 12 months. 

97Thirdly, all but one of the non-parole periods had expired by the date of hearing of this appeal. The only non-parole period that continues to apply to the applicant of is that of count 5, and it expires at the end of February 2014. On the other hand, a number of head sentences remain extant. 

Grounds of appeal

98Five grounds were originally notified. However, only three were pressed at the hearing:

""1. His Honour erred in his consideration of the standard non-parole period (Muldrock -v- The Queen (2011) HCA 39) for counts 6,7,9,10 & 11 (Fourth trial);

2. His Honour erred in failing to allow any discount at all for the guilty pleas entered with respect to both counts 1 & 4 (First trial);

...

5. His Honour erred in imposing certain sentences which were otherwise manifestly excessive.""

99Before any consideration of the grounds arises, however, it is necessary to consider whether the applicant should be given leave to appeal out of time with regard to sentences that were imposed in October 2008 with regard to criminality that occurred as long ago as January and February 2005.

Leave to appeal out of time

100It must seriously be doubted that an applicant should be permitted to appeal against sentences that were imposed so long ago. Although affidavits were received with regard to the question, they were hardly compelling. Not only that, to the extent that ground 2 focuses on the sentence imposed for earlier count 1 (a fixed term of imprisonment for only 6 months that expired on 30 July 2005; that is, over 8 years before the hearing of the appeal) it is hard to imagine that this Court should concern itself with such a sentence. It is well known that there are sound reasons why criminal appeals should not be permitted when they are grossly out of time: see, for example, the recent discussion in Ngo v R [2013] NSWCCA 142. In particular, the lack of a satisfactory explanation for the delay and the absence of meritorious grounds of appeal, as discussed in that case at [83] and [89] respectively, would militate against such leave being granted. 

101On the other hand, perhaps it could be said that, although all but one of the non-parole periods have indeed expired, their place in the overall sentencing structure could have affected the sentence that remains operative, including the length of its non-parole period. Not only that, there are still a number of head sentences that have the potential to detain the applicant, whether by way of a refusal to release him at the end of the concomitant non-parole period, or perhaps by way of a breach of parole in the future.

102Furthermore, since October 2011 this Court has not, to my knowledge, refused to entertain a ground founded on ""Muldrock error"" on the basis of the effluxion of time (see, however, the remarks in Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214 at [2] - [8] of Leeming JA with regard to the principle of finality).

103Finally, I consider that the grounds are at least arguable.

104In all the circumstances, I consider that leave should be granted.

Ground one

105This ground focused upon those counts to which a standard non-parole applied; namely counts 6, 7, 9, 10 and 11. It is founded upon the following portion of the remarks on sentence: 

""The Significance of the Standard Non-Parole Period

In his second reading speech addressing the legislation introducing the provisions for standard non-parole periods reported in Hansard on 23 October 2002, and quoted in R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168 at para 49, the Attorney General indicated that the standard non-parole period specified for an offence would represent the non-parole period appropriate for conduct within the middle range of objective seriousness for such an offence, and that the standard non-parole period would provide a reference point or benchmark within the sentencing spectrum for conduct that falls above or below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such an offence.

Section 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences included in the table to Part 4 Division 1A of the Act.

Section 54B provides that the court is to set the standard non-parole period fixed for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is either longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.

By force of s 54B(3) the reasons for which a court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter are restricted to those matters set out in s 21A of the Act. All of the matters set out in s 21A of the Act are matters that are, generally speaking, taken into account as aggravating or mitigating factors, with the exception that where a factor listed under s 21A as an aggravating factor is in fact as essential element of the offence, it cannot be said to act in such a case as an aggravating factor.

I take into account the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way: ibid, and subsequent authority, which confirm that the standard non-parole period strictly applies only to offences within the middle range of objective seriousness upon conviction after trial, but nevertheless provides another guidepost of sentencing in courts when a trial is avoided by a plea of guilty. The other guidepost is the maximum penalty provided for the offence. When determining the sentence to be imposed upon an offender the court assesses these guideposts in light of the assessed criminality of the offence and the offender, including the nature of his or her participation in the offence, the favourable subjective features of the offender, and any other discount entitlements for such things as a plea of guilty.

In accordance with the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way: ibid, one must ask whether reasons exist for not imposing the standard non-parole period. This question is answered by considering the objective seriousness of the offence in order to determine whether it falls within the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of the relevant kind. This assessment includes consideration of the applicable circumstances of aggravation and mitigation provided in s 21A of the Act and having regard to the general provisions of s 21A(1)(c) and the concluding sentence in s21A(1) of the Act. The circumstances of aggravation and mitigation that are relevant to this question as those that are directly or causally related to the commission of the offence. These may include matters that are itemised in s 21A(3) as mitigating factors.

Accordingly, assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence requires consideration of the conduct of the offender in his commission of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed, and consideration of the circumstances of aggravation and mitigation in s 21A of the Act that are relevant to those matters in the sense that they are directly or causally related to the offending conduct. If it is determined that the offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness, then the standard non-parole period applies but it is subject to appropriate discount where consideration such as a plea of guilty are to be brought to account. If it is determined that the offence does not fall within the middle range of objective seriousness, then the standard non-parole period is not imposed. The court is then required to exercise its sentencing discretion in accordance with established sentencing practices and by reference to matters identified in ss 3A, 21A, 22, 22A and 23 of the Act when they are relevant. Even though the standard non-parole period is not to be imposed in such cases, it remains a reference point or guidepost along with other relevant extrinsic aids such as authority, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty. 

For the reasons that will appear hereunder, the sentences I am about to impose for the offences for which there is a standard non-parole period will reflect my assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences and the extend of the misconduct of the offender in the commission falls at the middle range of objective seriousness contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act and my assessment of the subjective factors that are available in support of his position.""

106The applicant submitted that, as one would expect in light of the date when sentence was imposed, his Honour had sentenced in accordance with the decision of R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 and not in accordance with the decision of Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; (2011) 244 CLR 120. The submission was, in short, that the approach adopted by his Honour was overly structured and prescriptive. Not only that, the length of the non-parole periods themselves for many of the offences (such as the sexual offences) supports the proposition that his Honour adopted an approach that was too rigid. 

107The Crown submitted that, in truth, the remarks that found the ground could be read as being in accordance with the substantially more flexible approach adopted by the High Court some two years ago.

Determination

108I do not consider that, in order to determine this ground, it is necessary for me to review the body of jurisprudence of this Court that has developed in the time since Muldrock v The Queen was delivered: see R v Koloamatangi [2011] NSWCCA 288, Yang v R [2012] NSWCCA 49, and R A Hulme J, ""After Muldrock  sentencing for standard non-parole period offences in NSW"" (2012) 24(10) Judicial Officers' Bulletin 81.

109Of course, simply because a sentence was imposed before Muldrock v The Queen was promulgated does not of itself mean that the approach to sentencing was erroneous: see Butler v R [2012] NSWCCA 23. Each case must be determined on its own merits. 

110Here, I consider that it is established that his Honour adopted a rather more structured approach than was consonant with what the High Court of Australia said three years later. Of course, not the slightest criticism can be made of his Honour for doing so.

111In short, I consider that a fair reading of the remarks on sentence, combined with the sentences actually imposed, demonstrates that his Honour gave the standard non-parole period inappropriate weight, in light of the subsequent development of the statutory interpretation of Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.

112It follows that I consider that this ground has been made out. Whether there should be any adjustment to the sentences in light of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 is another question entirely, to which I shall return at the end of my judgment.

Ground two

113It will be recalled that the applicant pleaded guilty to the earlier count 1 and the earlier count 4 many months before the end of the trial before Judge Bennett. It will also be recalled that the Crown led evidence of those crimes in any event. And it can be seen from my review of the objective features that they were just two of many, many acts of the applicant placed before the jury in the final trial. 

114In that regard, his Honour said in the remarks on sentence:

""Diaz pleaded guilty to only two of the offences upon which he is to be sentenced. This he did when he was arraigned before Judge Armitage at the commencement of the first of these trials. It cannot be said that his decision to do so has provided much in the way of utility or that it in any way demonstrates remorse and contrition to mitigate the reprehensible cruelty and brutality upon which he engaged in his mistreatment of the complainant. There shall be no discount allowed for those pleas.""

115Towards the end of his remarks, his Honour said:

""I have noted the pleas of guilty by the offender. In my assessment they do not in the circumstances justify any reduction in what otherwise would be the appropriate sentences.""

116The submission of the applicant was simple. He submitted that, in accordance with the seminal case of R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, there should have been some reduction for the utilitarian value of the two pleas. Whilst he accepted that the sentence imposed for the earlier count 1 was so trivial, in the overall sentence structure, that it is most unlikely that it had any effect on the overall period of incarceration, he submitted that the same could not be said with regard to the earlier count 4. It will be remembered that that offence, to which the applicant pleaded guilty at an early stage, resulted in a head sentence of imprisonment for 4 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. 

117The simple submission of the Crown was that the well-known case of R v Thomson; R v Houlton does not mandate a utilitarian discount in every case in which a plea of guilty is entered. In this case, it was submitted, the approach of the sentencing Judge was correct, because the two pleas of guilty did not result in any reduction in the amount of evidence led in the Crown case, or in the court time taken. The most that could be said is that, in accordance with those pleas, there could have been no cross-examination about the subject matter of those two counts directed towards reasonable doubt as to whether or not they had occurred. In short, the Crown submitted that it was open to the evaluative judgment of his Honour not to provide a discount, even despite the fact that those pleas had been entered months before the resolution of the matter.

Determination

118In R v Thomson; R v Houlton, Spigelman CJ delivered a judgment which enjoyed the unanimous agreement of a five judge bench of this Court. At [160] of that judgment, his Honour said:

""The Court should adopt the following guideline applicable to offences against State laws:

(i) A sentencing judge should explicitly state that a plea of guilty has been taken into account. Failure to do so will generally be taken to indicate that the plea was not given weight.

(ii) Sentencing judges are encouraged to quantify the effect of the plea on the sentence in so far as they believe it appropriate to do so. This effect can encompass any or all of the matters to which the plea may be relevant - contrition, witness vulnerability and utilitarian value - but particular encouragement is given to the quantification of the last-mentioned matter. Where other matters are regarded as appropriate to be quantified in a particular case, for example, assistance to authorities, a single combined quantification will often be appropriate.

(iii) The utilitarian value of a plea to the criminal justice system should generally be assessed in the range of 10-25 per cent discount on sentence. The primary consideration determining where in the range a particular case should fall, is the timing of the plea. What is to be regarded as an early plea will vary according to the circumstances of the case and is a matter for determination by the sentencing judge.

(iv) In some cases the plea, in combination with other relevant factors, will change the nature of the sentence imposed. In some cases a plea will not lead to any discount."" (emphasis added)

119In other words, contrary to the submission of the applicant, the guideline judgment that has stood for the past 13 years explicitly countenances situations in which, although there is a plea of guilty, there will not be any discount.

120Here, the utilitarian value of the pleas was, in the overall scheme of things, so trivial as to be either nothing or virtually nothing. I accept that in the vast majority of cases, and in accordance with the guideline and its application over the past many years, sentencing judges should provide a discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. But I consider that this is the rare case in which the refusal to discount the sentence was reasonably open to the evaluative judgment of the learned sentencing Judge about the question.

121It follows that I consider that this ground should be rejected.

Ground five

122This ground focused on some but not all of the sentences imposed; namely earlier counts 1 and 7, and counts 1-11. It was founded chiefly upon an analysis of statistics that suggest that the sentences imposed were very much towards the top of the range of sentences imposed by other judges in other matters. It was submitted that that result is not consonant with the finding of his Honour that counts 6, 7, 9 and10 fell within ""the middle range of objective seriousness"". 

123The Crown submitted that it could hardly be expected that, in light of the harrowing facts of the matter, the sentencing Judge would impose anything other than a very substantial sentence. The submission was that neither any individual sentence, nor the total head sentence, nor the total non-parole period, was unreasonable or plainly unjust, to use the well-known phrase from Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25, (2005) 228 CLR 357.

Determination

124My respectful response to the analysis founded on the observation that the sentences are towards the top of the range of those imposed at first instance is that one would hardly expect otherwise, in light of the profound gravity of the offences.

125I do not consider that the generous characterisation of some of the offences as in the mid-range of objective seriousness detracts from the appropriateness of the position of the offences within the statistical spectrum. 

126I shall turn to analyse the impugned individual sentences in the order in which they appear in the sentence structure and remarks on sentence; that is, in general order of commencement date. 

127With regard to the earlier count 1, it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that a fixed term of 6 months was manifestly excessive for destroying a mobile phone and SIM card. 

128Complaint was also made about the fixed terms of 12 months and 8 months imposed with regard to counts 1 and 4, pertaining to the damage of the laptop and the camera. 

129Count 2 was founded, it will be recalled, on a broken laptop being thrown at the victim's thigh, and causing injury to it. It resulted in a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months.

130It is convenient to discuss all four of those sentences together.

131I consider that the sentences for the three offences of malicious damage were beyond the discretion open to his Honour. Although each of them was certainly committed in the context of very serious offending, each offence on its own was not of the greatest seriousness. Indeed, if they were the only offences for which the applicant was being dealt with, they would almost certainly have been disposed of in the Local Court. And despite the criminal record of the accused, it would have been quite likely that they would have been dealt with by way of an alternative to full-time imprisonment.

132In the circumstances, I consider that a nominal fixed term of imprisonment for 1 month to date from 31 January 2005 should be substituted for each offence of malicious damage. 

133As for count 2, it will be recalled that that was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm founded, as I have said, on the throwing of the laptop at the thigh of the victim. His Honour found that that caused her ""extreme pain"", but did not otherwise determine in the remarks on sentence what was the actual bodily harm occasioned to the victim.

134Again, I consider that a head sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months was beyond the discretion open to his Honour in this circumstances. For the general reasons given above with regard to the offences of malicious damage, I propose instead a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 months to date from 31 January 2005. 

135I shall return to consider the effect that those adjustments have upon the sentence structure a little later.

136Count 3 encapsulated the detention and beating of the victim by the applicant over an extended period. The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. In light of all of the objective and subjective features, it cannot be said, in my respectful opinion, that a sentence of imprisonment for 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years is assailable as manifestly excessive.

137The earlier count 7 was, it will be recalled, the first of the offences committed in Glebe. It will be recalled that it was founded upon the blow to the throat and choking of a woman who had very recently been released from hospital and operated upon for a broken jaw inflicted by the applicant. Her jaw was forcibly grabbed, causing immense pain. It was an act notable for its cruelty. In light of the maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years, I reject the proposition that the head sentence of 3 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months is manifestly excessive.

138Counts 6 and 7 were founded upon two instances of penile/vaginal sexual intercourse without consent. They occurred in a context of extended violence, degradation, and severe physical and psychological suffering. The maximum penalty was imprisonment for 14 years, and a standard non-parole period of 7 years was prescribed. I accept that a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 7 years is, in each case, substantial. But I am not persuaded that those sentences are manifestly excessive.

139Count 8 was founded upon an offence of attempted sexual intercourse without consent. It will be recalled that it reflected an adult man seeking to force a woman whose jaw he had very recently broken to perform oral sex upon him. Not only that, he was well aware that her jaw had been the subject of an operation and received up to 30 sutures. That context makes the particular offence far more serious than an example of the offence that lacks those peculiarly cruel attributes. I am not persuaded that a head sentence of imprisonment 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months is manifestly excessive in those circumstances.

140Count 9 was founded upon yet another instance of non-consensual penile/vaginal intercourse. That offence occurred shortly after the victim failed to perform fellatio on the applicant (the subject matter of count 8). Count 10 was founded upon a further instance of penile/vaginal intercourse without consent that followed the applicant verbally abusing the victim. Again, whilst I accept that the sentences comprising a head sentence of imprisonment for 9 years 4 months and a non-parole period of 7 years are substantial, I am not persuaded that they are manifestly excessive.

141Count 11, the final count of sexual intercourse without consent, was founded upon penile/anal intercourse inflicted upon the victim. It will be recalled that adding to the degradation and corporal invasion inherent in any penetrative sexual assault was the fact that the applicant declared himself to be disgusted with the whole process. Not only that, the victim suffered the added indignity of having injury inflicted that caused her to bleed from the anus. I do not regard a head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months as manifestly excessive.

142The final sentence about which complaint is made as part of this ground is count 5. That was the count that encompassed the whole of the detention of the victim over an extended period at Glebe, along with all of the violence and injuries that were not encompassed in other offences. A head sentence of imprisonment for 10 years 8 months with a non parole period of 7 years 7 months was imposed. 

143As against a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years, and bearing in mind that this offence of detention was committed very soon after a similar offence of equal gravity, with only a period of hospitalisation intervening, I cannot accept that the sentence is manifestly excessive.

144I turn next to consider the question of whether the total head sentence and total non-parole period are manifestly excessive.

145I have already indicated that aspects of the sentence structure carry with them a degree of leniency. And speaking more generally, I do not accept that a total head sentence of imprisonment for 12 years 2 months with a total non-parole period of 9 years 1 month can be said to be beyond the range of the legitimate discretion open to his Honour, in light of the deplorable criminality inherent in these 14 counts.

146Finally, it is necessary to consider whether the adjustments I propose to the sentences for earlier count 1, count 1, count 4, and count 2 should have any effect on the overall structure. In particular, one needs to consider whether the degree of cumulation of any other sentence should be reduced to some extent.

147As for the three sentences for malicious damage, in light of their length both before and after adjustment, their triviality in the scheme of things, and their complete concurrence with other, more serious offences, I reject any suggestion that their reduction should lead to alteration of the sentence structure in favour of the applicant.

148As for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, it is true that I propose that it should be markedly reduced. But the only sentence that could possibly be adjusted with regard to commencement date as a result of the shortening of the sentence for count 2 is that imposed for count 4. As discussed, that commences only 6 months after all of the other offences committed at Randwick, including an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. I do not accept that that minor degree of cumulation should be further reduced.

149In the circumstances, I consider that the reduction in the sentence for count 2 cannot lead to any alteration of any other sentence, including count 3.

150The result is that, although some sentences that expired years ago have been reduced as a result of the partial success of ground three, that success will have no effect on the overall custodial position of the applicant. 

151In short, I would allow ground three in part.

Section 6(3) with regard to ground one

152As I have indicated, I would uphold ground one, despite my misgivings about leave being granted to argue it. And I regard the error as being a material one. The question for determination then becomes whether a lesser sentence is warranted in law.

153In that regard, no evidence with regard to the progress of the applicant since the date of sentence was relied upon. But I consider it appropriate to take into account the evidence that was relied upon with regard to leave. That shows that the applicant has found incarceration stressful, at least in its early stages. Other than that, I know little of the progress of the applicant over the past eight years or so. 

154It is true that the applicant had never been sentenced to full-time imprisonment before. I also suspect that prohibited drugs markedly exacerbated the violent proclivities of the applicant, including his sexual behaviour. But that latter factor cannot sound powerfully in mitigation in this matter: ZZ v R [2013] NSWCCA 83 at [113]. His criminal record shows that, for years before the commission of these offences, the applicant had a serious problem with anger that had, on one occasion, led to him terrorising a woman with whom he had been in an intimate relationship. The offences under consideration occurred in two discrete blocks, and were not merely one explosion of criminality. Most importantly, the offences were exceptional in their cruelty and brutality.

155In all the circumstances, I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence is warranted in law, either with regard to any individual offence that is the subject of ground one, or with regard to the total head sentence or the total non-parole period.

156It follows that, although I consider that ground one has been made out, that should have no effect on the sentences imposed by his Honour. 

Orders

157I propose the following orders:

(1)Leave to appeal granted.

(2)Appeal allowed in part.

(3)Sentence with regard to count one on the earlier indictment of 21 November 2005 quashed.

(4)Sentences with regard to counts one, two and four on the indictment of 6 June 2007 quashed.

(5)With regard to count one on the earlier indictment of 21 November 2005, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 month. The sentence is to commence on 31 January 2005 and expire on 28 February 2005.

(6)With regard to count one on the indictment of 6 June 2007, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 month. The sentence is to commence on 31 January 2005 and expire on 28 February 2005.

(7)With regard to count two on the indictment of 6 June 2007, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 months. The sentence is to commence on 31 January 2005 and expire 30 April 2005.

(8)With regard to count four on the indictment of 6 June 2007, the applicant is sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 1 month. The sentence is to commence on 31 January 2005 and expire on 28 February 2005. 

(9)The first date upon which the applicant will be eligible for parole is 28 February 2014.

(10)Appeal otherwise dismissed.

2705868,Currie v R [2013] NSWCCA 267,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J and the orders which he proposes.

2JOHNSON J: The Applicant, Desmond Jeffrey Currie, seeks an extension of time to apply for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court on 29 August 2008. After trial, the Applicant was convicted and sentenced with respect to two counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent under s.61J Crimes Act 1900 and one count of indecent assault under s.61L Crimes Act 1900.

3The maximum penalty under s.61J is imprisonment for 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The maximum penalty for a s.61L offence is five years' imprisonment.

The Sentences

4On each of the s.61J counts, the Applicant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 13 November 2007 and expiring on 12 November 2017, with a balance of term of three years and four months commencing on 13 November 2017 and expiring on 12 March 2021. 

5On the s.61L count, the Applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 13 November 2007 and expiring on 12 May 2009. This sentence was subsumed in the sentences for the s.61J offences.

The Present Application

6On 19 February 2009, the Applicant lodged a Notice of Intention to Appeal against conviction and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The Applicant sought legal aid for the purpose of an appeal and, on 23 December 2009, he was informed that legal aid had been refused.

7The Applicant did not proceed with an appeal and the Notice of Intention to Appeal lapsed. 

8On 5 October 2011, the High Court of Australia gave judgment in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120 (""Muldrock""). Following that decision, the Applicant's case was reviewed (together with a number of others) by the Standard Non-Parole Period Review Team established within Legal Aid NSW. On 31 January 2013, the Applicant was informed that his case had been reviewed in light of the decision in Muldrock and he was invited to complete an application for legal aid for further work to be undertaken.

9On 28 June 2013, a Notice of Application for Extension of Time for Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal was filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal, seeking an extension of time under s.10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
 
10The sole ground of appeal relied upon by the Applicant is in the following terms:

""His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] 244 CLR 120.""

11The concept of ""Muldrock error"" was considered in Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247 at [19]-[28]. What is said there will assist an understanding of some of the issues raised in this application.

12The principles to be applied on an application for extension of time such as this were considered by this Court in Abdul v R at [42]-[53]. Those principles will be applied in determining the present application for extension of time.

Muldrock Error is Conceded

13The Crown concedes that the sentencing Judge approached the sentencing of the Applicant upon a basis which did not comply with the decision in Muldrock. This concession was appropriately made. His Honour found the s.61J offences were mid-range offences and stated that he saw ""no reason why the standard non-parole period should not apply"" (ROS7). Other findings were made with respect to sentence, including the Applicant's mental state, to which reference will be made. However, it is clear that Muldrock error is demonstrated in this case.

14The Crown submitted that, in the circumstances of the case, the Court would conclude that no lesser sentence is warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, so that the Court should refuse the Applicant an extension of time.

15Given the Crown concession of Muldrock error, it is appropriate to set out objective and subjective matters which are relevant to the exercise of discretion to extend time, including evidence concerning the Applicant's custodial history since sentence was passed.

The Applicant's Offences

16The Applicant was born in 1963. As will be seen, he has an extensive criminal history, including sexual assault offences committed in 1994, for which he was sentenced to terms of imprisonment. 

17In September 2005, the victim, a young woman from Estonia, travelled to Australia on a working holiday. 

18On 23 September 2005, the victim's 24th birthday, she travelled from Brisbane to spend a few days in Byron Bay. The victim booked into backpacker accommodation, bought a bottle of wine and was socialising with a number of persons. 

19The Applicant, then aged 42 years, joined the group and the conversation turned to the victim's intention to travel to Sydney to meet her partner. The Applicant indicated that he too was travelling that way to visit his grandmother. He offered the victim a lift for $60.00. The victim accepted.

20The Applicant suggested that they leave immediately. He and the victim walked to a four-wheel drive vehicle parked in a nearby car park. The Applicant drove the victim to the backpacker accommodation, where she picked up her belongings and they set off on the journey from Byron Bay. It was night time. Having driven for about 40 minutes, the Applicant stopped at a lookout where they shared a joint. 

21The Applicant then drove to a remote property, assuring the victim that the route he was taking was a ""faster way of getting there"". The victim was affected by the cannabis she had consumed, but the Applicant appeared friendly and they chatted and laughed during the journey. However, when the Applicant drove to the remote property on the pretext of ""getting more weed"", the victim felt uncomfortable.

22A house was located on the remote property to which the Applicant had driven. The house was clearly abandoned, and the victim noticed a makeshift table beside the house. She remained in the vehicle whilst the Applicant got out and walked around the house. When the Applicant returned to the vehicle, he said that he wanted to play his didgeridoo, which he did for a couple of minutes.

23The Applicant then got out of the vehicle again, before returning and driving the vehicle a short distance before stopping. The Applicant said to the victim, ""I want to make love to you"". The victim replied, ""No thanks, I'm not interested. Like I have a girlfriend of five years, you know like I've never cheated on her, I'm not going to cheat on her right now on my birthday of all the days in the year, like it's just - it's ridiculous"".

24The Applicant replied, ""We can do this the easy way or we can do it the hard way"". A struggle ensued as the victim attempted to get out of the vehicle. The Applicant had a knife in his right hand and he put it to the victim's neck. The knife was about 8-10 centimetres long, similar to a fishing knife. The victim said, ""Please no, why are you doing this?"" and the Applicant said, ""You know how to play the game"". The victim said, ""Please don't hurt me"". The Applicant said, ""Do you want us to hurt you?"". 

25The victim said to the Applicant, ""I'll do whatever, just put away the knife"". The Applicant appeared to relax and he put the knife away.

26The Applicant exposed his penis and said, ""I want you to give me a blow job"". He forced the victim's head onto his groin and forced his penis into her mouth causing the victim to retch (first s.61J count). The victim told him that she did not want to do this.

27The Applicant then told the victim to get out of the vehicle. He took her to the makeshift table, lifted her up and placed her on the table. The Applicant pulled up the victim's t-shirt and sucked her breasts (the s.61L count). 

28The Applicant pulled down the victim's pants and underwear, and placed his penis into her vagina. He pulled her from the table onto the ground and continued to have sexual intercourse with her until he ejaculated (second s.61J count).

29The Applicant walked back to the vehicle. He told the victim that he had what he wanted from her and that he would now continue driving. The victim got back into the vehicle and they drove for some time, with the Applicant driving to another property to get some ""weed"", by which time the sun had risen. The Applicant appeared to speak with a man at this property for a short time and then returned to the vehicle and continued driving. 

30The victim noticed that they were passing through towns and she took the opportunity to get out at Macksville (some 298 kilometres from Byron Bay), having arrived there at about 8.00 am. The victim went to a pharmacist to buy the morning-after pill, bought a train ticket to Sydney, left a message on her partner's mobile telephone indicating when she expected to arrive in Sydney and had a shower. Upon arrival in Sydney, the matter was reported to police. A sexual assault examination of the victim was undertaken with samples taken for DNA analysis.

31The Applicant was arrested on 16 February 2006 as his fingerprints were located on a motor vehicle which had been stolen at Chinderah at about midnight on 23 September 2005, and later recovered in Taree in October 2005. The Applicant was released on bail pending further enquiries.

32In July 2006, police were notified that the Applicant's DNA profile matched the profile obtained from the samples taken from the victim of these sexual assaults. The police established a link between the stolen vehicle and the sexual assaults, in that certain features of the vehicle used by the perpetrator were described by the victim, including fishing rod holders and petrol tanks.

33The Applicant was arrested in relation to these offences on 27 July 2006 and was granted conditional bail. 

34The Applicant was convicted of all offences following a trial before his Honour Judge Black QC and a jury at the Lismore District Court between 6 and 13 November 2007. The Applicant did not give evidence at the trial. It appears that the issue at trial was consent. He was remanded in custody on 13 November 2007 and has remained in custody since.

The Applicant's Criminal History and Subjective Circumstances

35The Applicant has a lengthy criminal history commencing in 1976. The record includes:

(a)eight counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent committed in 1994 (see below);

(b)47 break and enter, stealing, receiving or other property-related crimes;

(c)three offences involving assault;

(d)41 driving or motor vehicle-related offences, including dangerous driving causing death for which a sentence of imprisonment was imposed in the Brisbane District Court in 1986;

(e)eight drug-related offences.

36At the time of the commission of the present offences, the Applicant was subject to conditional liberty, having been sentenced to a suspended term of imprisonment for 12 months at the Tweed Heads Local Court on 21 February 2005 for driving whilst disqualified. 

37It is appropriate to refer in a little detail to the sexual assault offences committed by the Applicant in 1994. Counsel for the Applicant before his Honour Judge Black QC in 2008 acknowledged the similarity between the two sets of offences.

38The Applicant (then aged 31 years) entered the 19-year old victim's flat at Tweed Heads in the early hours of the morning of 14 January 1994. The Applicant maintained that he was there to meet an acquaintance of the victim. The Applicant and the victim smoked some cannabis. Soon after, the Applicant offered the victim money for sex but she declined. She told him to leave and opened the door for that purpose. The Applicant shut the door, turned off the lights and, when the victim tried to re-open the door, he grabbed a kitchen knife. He forced the victim into the bedroom with the knife at her throat and told her not to make any noise. Despite the victim's pleas to leave her alone, the Applicant repeatedly assaulted her sexually by way of penile vaginal and anal intercourse, digital anal penetration and fellatio. The Applicant then fell asleep and the victim fled in a distressed state and made immediate complaint to a neighbour. 

39The Applicant was sentenced on 16 March 1995 to a total effective sentence of seven years' imprisonment, comprising a non-parole period of four years and an additional term of three years. 

40An appeal against conviction and sentence was dismissed: R v Currie (Court of Criminal Appeal, 31 October 1997). In the course of dismissing the appeal against conviction, Smart J (Hunt CJ at CL and Bruce J agreeing) observed that the Applicant ""faced a formidable Crown case"" and his ""explanations were not easy to accept"". In rejecting a ground asserting that the verdicts were unsafe and unsatisfactory, Smart J said:

""From my earlier summary of the evidence it is apparent that this ground is without merit. The complainant's evidence was cogent, she fled as soon as she could, she was distressed, she made a prompt complaint and the appellant was found by 3 men naked on her bed shortly thereafter. He initially denied intercourse. Subsequently, he said that there had been consensual intercourse. The appellant did not give evidence and was unable to explain satisfactorily the objective facts and some of his earlier statements to the police. He proffered an explanation as to why he denied having sexual intercourse.""

41His Honour said with respect to the sentence appeal:

""The offence was a serious one involving uninvited entry to the complainant's home in the early hours of the morning, threatening her with a knife and raping her. The judge said, correctly, that it was difficult to find any mitigating features in the objective facts. The judge found that alcohol and smoking marijuana were significant features of the entire incident. The judge accepted that the offence was one which was out of character for him. The appellant's record does not entitle him to leniency.

The judge had regard, amongst other things to the appellant's deprived background, the attempts which he had made to overcome this, his musical gifts which may lead to a musical career and his strong ties with his wife and family. The judge was concerned that a lengthy period in gaol would disrupt these. The judge also had regard to the special factors which affect the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders. After a thoughtful review of the subjective features the judge correctly felt constrained by the gravity of the offence.

The sentence is not manifestly excessive. No basis exists for interfering with the sentence.""

42The Applicant's wife and brother gave evidence at the sentencing hearing in 2008. Nathan Moran, the Applicant's brother, gave unchallenged evidence concerning the Applicant's unhappy and dysfunctional background. The Applicant's grandmother was one of 16 siblings from the South-West Rocks Aboriginal Reserve, all of whom were removed from home and placed in institutions. The Applicant's mother was also taken into care at the Cootamundra Girls' Home, but escaped when she was 11 years of age and returned to the north coast. At the age of 14 years, the Applicant's mother was sexually assaulted by Kenneth Currie, the Applicant's father. She was aged 15 years and one month when the Applicant was born. Mr Moran testified that violence was an everyday occurrence in their community and that there was a lot of violence during the Applicant's early years. The Applicant's mother later moved to Sydney with the Applicant, however, his father forcibly removed him and his mother did not have further contact for many years. The Applicant was cared for by members of his father's extended family until he became a ward of the State at the age of eight or nine years.

43The Applicant's wife, Deidre Currie, met the Applicant in 1990 and they married in 1992. She came from a stable background. They had four children, aged 16, 15 and eight-year old twins (as at August 2008). Mr Moran testified that Ms Currie had been a positive influence on the Applicant's life. 

44Ms Currie testified that the Applicant had been diagnosed for the first time with bipolar disorder in July 2004 and was prescribed Lithium and Zyprexa. Despite Ms Currie urging the Applicant to take his medication, he had ceased taking it in August 2005. At the time of these offences, the Applicant was apparently not residing with his wife. 

45A report of Dr Bruce Westmore dated 13 August 2008 was tendered at the sentencing hearing. Dr Westmore referred to competing features of the evidence concerning the Applicant's mental state. On the one hand, Dr Westmore pointed to the victim's account of the Applicant's friendly conversation with no hint of disordered thinking or conduct. On the other hand, Dr Westmore pointed to evidence of the diagnosis of mental disorder. He expressed the view, on the balance of probabilities, that the Applicant was suffering from an early relapse of his mental illness at that time and that the mental illness was present, to some degree, when the offences were committed on 24 September 2005. 
 
46However, Dr Westmore went on to observe:

""I do note the existence of a previous sexual offence, which I am presuming at this time occurred in the absence of a hypomanic episode. If that is the case, then it reflects longer standing behavioural problems of a sexual offending type and those problems are likely to be multidetermined in their aetiology, including the presence of aggressive sexual urges and his inability to control them and issues arising from his personality.""

47Dr Westmore observed further:

""Mr Currie has in the past demonstrated dangerous behaviour as reflected in his criminal history and the matters now before the court. He has had problems in the past with insight and compliance and while in a manic state, his risks to the community will increase.""

48Dr Westmore provided a provisional diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder with a likelihood, as well, that he suffered from an antisocial personality disorder.

Remarks on Sentence

49Although Muldrock error is conceded, it remains important to refer to aspects of the remarks on sentence. The sentencing Judge delivered ex tempore remarks on sentence immediately after the sentencing hearing on 29 August 2008. 

50As Spigelman CJ observed in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 at 577 [48], the conditions under which District Court Judges give such reasons ""are not such as to permit their remarks to be parsed and analysed"". In R v Speechley [2012] NSWCCA 130; 221 A Crim R 175 at 180-181 [34], with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Hammerschlag J, I observed:

""... it is necessary to keep in mind that the remarks on sentence were delivered ex tempore immediately following the sentencing hearing on 3 February 2012. This course had the undoubted advantage that those present in Court could hear immediately the sentence which was passed and his Honour's reasons for passing that sentence. A consequence of this approach, which is understandable in a busy court, is that remarks on sentence may not be 'as robustly structured as they might otherwise have been' (Simpson J in Simkhada v R [2010] NSWCCA 284 at [24]) and may 'lack the order and precision of language that can be incorporated into a judgment after the luxury of time for consideration, refinement of expression, and polishing' (Simpson J in Rotner v R [2011] NSWCCA 207 at [57])."" 


51It is important to keep these statements in mind, in particular, when considering submissions that his Honour did not refer in the remarks to certain matters which had been the subject of evidence and submissions at the sentencing hearing.

52The sentencing Judge adverted to the facts of the offence, noting that the offences were more than opportunistic because they ""involved inveigling [the victim] into a vehicle and driving off to a remote area"" (ROS2). 

53His Honour referred to the victim impact statement read in the sentencing proceedings, noting that the victim ""was a woman of considerable commonsense and ... strength"" who had taken the ""very courageous course"" of not resisting when the knife threat was made. His Honour noted the deleterious consequences of the offences committed against the victim (ROS3-4).

54His Honour observed that the main aspect that had occupied oral addresses was the relevance of mental illness on sentence. Reference was made to the evidence of the Applicant's wife, which his Honour accepted. The sentencing Judge referred to Dr Westmore's report and his opinion that it was likely that the Applicant's mental illness ""was present to some degree"" at the time of the offences. His Honour continued (ROS6):

""The important words which I am quite sure Dr Westmore chose with care are 'to some degree'. I take the view that one cannot ignore what happened in 1994 and while the illness may have some relevance to what happened in September 2005 it does not answer the entire situation and I cannot on this evidence be satisfied that the evidence [sic] was the trigger or cause of what happened. I think it is a relevant consideration.""

55The sentencing Judge then turned to the significance of the Applicant choosing not to take his medication. His Honour said (ROS6):

""He had been aware, although his wife, perhaps somewhat loyally says that as far as she is concerned he may not fully have appreciated objectively what was wrong with him, he knew he had to take medication, he chose not to and it seems to me that he must therefore accept the responsibility for being visited with the consequences. If that is a somewhat narrow view, nevertheless I must also take into account that this is a man who will not or did not on this occasion and who is to say it may not happen again, did not take his appropriate medication, which he knew he had to take and it isn't as if this is something that was undiscovered at the time. So at the end of the day for the reasons I have attempted to enumerate while I accept there may be the presence of a mental illness to some degree, I do not see it affecting one way or the other the overall assessment of this case. I do not see it as being of a benefit to the offender, I do take it into the account when assessing the protection of the public here in arriving at my overall assessment of where this offence lies.""

56His Honour adverted to the Applicant's criminal history, noting the sexual assault offences in 1994. 

57The sentencing Judge determined to make all sentences entirely concurrent as ""they were all part and parcel of the same activity"" (ROS7). His Honour then proceeded to pass the sentences presently under challenge.

Further Sentences Imposed in October 2008

58After being sentenced for the present offences on 29 August 2008, the Applicant was sentenced on 16 October 2008 at the Port Macquarie District Court for two unrelated offences of aggravated break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. 

59For these offences, the Applicant was sentenced to an effective non-parole period of three years and three months commencing on 16 October 2008 and expiring on 15 January 2012, with a balance of term of nine months commencing on 16 January 2012 and expiring on 15 October 2012. 

60It will be observed that these sentences were entirely subsumed by the sentences imposed for the present offences. There was no additional penalty for these offences.

Submissions on the Application

61Detailed written submissions were made by the parties, supplemented by oral submissions at the hearing. Brief reference will be made to the submissions.

Submissions for the Applicant

62In light of the conceded Muldrock error, the Applicant submitted that lesser sentences are warranted in law for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Affidavits of the Applicant and the Applicant's solicitor were read in support of the application. 

63It was submitted that this Court should reach the conclusion that lesser sentences are warranted in law, in particular, by reference to:

(a)the correct approach to the standard non-parole periods in accordance with Muldrock;

(b)the giving of full weight to the Applicant's deprived background in accordance with the principles in Bugmy v The Queen [2013] HCA 37; 87 ALJR 1022 at 1032 [44];

(c)the giving of appropriate weight to the Applicant's mental illness in accordance with the principles in Bugmy v The Queen at 1033 [47]-[48];

(d)the progress made by the Applicant in prison, including evidence with respect to his mental illness and his willingness to undertake a sex offender's program;

(e)statistics concerning sentences imposed for s.61J Crimes Act 1900 offences before and after the decision in Muldrock, and other sentencing decisions for s.61J offences.

64Although it was accepted that any resentencing of the Applicant may take into account the later sentences passed in October 2008, with some accumulation being appropriate, it was submitted that this Court should intervene and impose sentences which ought be shorter than those passed at first instance.

Submissions of the Crown

65The Crown submitted that, after applying relevant principles, no lesser sentences are warranted in the Applicant's case so that the application for an extension of time ought be refused.

66The Crown submitted that this conclusion may be reached after applying the principles in Muldrock and Bugmy v The Queen and other applicable principles.

67It was submitted that particular care is required concerning submissions made by reference to statistics and other sentencing decisions.

68The Crown submitted, as well, that entirely concurrent sentences had been passed for the s.61J offences. Even if some alteration to the sentence was warranted, an appropriate level of accumulation would result in sentences of no lesser duration.

69The Crown submitted that the evidence concerning the Applicant's progress in custody between 2008 and 2013 indicated that his compliance with medication remained problematic, with this aspect bearing upon his prospect of reoffending and the protection of the community.

70It was submitted that the existence and length of the October 2008 sentences was a further reason for refusal of an extension of time.

Determination

71It is appropriate for the Court to consider the merits of the application for the purpose of determining whether an extension of time should be granted in this case. A foundation for an extension of time, and intervention by the Court, may be demonstrated if the Court forms the view that substantial injustice would result if the application for extension of time is refused. 

72The Court is entitled, in accordance with the principles in Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 and Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284, to have regard to post-sentence conduct and the position of the Applicant at the time when the application is being determined. Accordingly, the Applicant relies upon evidence concerning events in his life and in his custodial setting since sentence was imposed. However, post-sentence events which operate adversely to the Applicant may also be taken into account: Douar v R at 178-179 [129]-[131].

73In determining this application, it is necessary to have regard to the objective gravity of the offences, the subjective circumstances of the Applicant, the need for specific and general deterrence (which remain substantial, even making due allowance for Dr Westmore's report) and the evidence concerning the Applicant's mental health in custody. It is necessary, as well, to have regard to the principles of accumulation, concurrency and totality. 

74The present offences were of considerable objective gravity. The Applicant ""inveigled"" the victim, a younger woman whom he had just met, into travelling with him in a motor vehicle to a remote area. Although it may be accepted that the Applicant's judgment was affected to some extent by the onset of a mental illness, the condition did not impact upon his capacity to converse coherently and apparently reasonably with the victim and to drive a motor vehicle long distances for the purposes of conveying the victim to and from the scene of the sexual assaults.

75It must also be kept in mind that the Applicant's very supportive wife had urged him to take his medication, and that the Applicant was well aware that he should do so, and of the deleterious consequences if he did not. Consideration of this issue in R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51-52 has direct application to these circumstances. 

76The Applicant took the victim to a remote location, a no doubt frightening scenario, where he threatened her at knifepoint and then sexually assaulted her in different ways. The fact that the Applicant drove the victim back into town, and did not abandon her at the remote location, provides limited assistance only on the question of sentence. 

77As was his right, the Applicant went to trial and was convicted. He was not entitled to any discount which would have applied if he had pleaded guilty. 

78There was, and continues to be, no expression by the Applicant of contrition or remorse for his grave offences against the victim. 

79The Applicant's offences were committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty. It does not matter that the suspended sentence applicable at the time was for an offence of driving whilst disqualified, an offence of a different character to the present offences. The present offences were committed by the Applicant at a time when he was subject to a court order requiring good behaviour on his part and his offences constituted grave breaches of his conditional liberty: Porter v R [2008] NSWCCA 145 at [86].

80Although the sentencing Judge did not refer to the Applicant's deprived background in his remarks on sentence, written submissions had been made (by the Crown) by reference to Neal v The Queen [1982] HCA 55; 149 CLR 305 at 326 and R v Fernando (1992) 76 A Crim R 58, and his Honour had heard evidence from the Applicant's brother and wife. It should not be concluded that his Honour disregarded this evidence at the time of delivering his ex tempore judgment.

81In any event, the Applicant is entitled to have full weight accorded as a result of his deprived background: Bugmy v The Queen at 1032 [44]. This is one of several factors to be taken into account in considering the circumstances of the Applicant and of his offences. An additional factor to be kept in mind in this case is the substantial evidence concerning the stable environment in which the Applicant had lived since the early 1990s with his wife, who provided significant assistance to him in the community. This is not a case of ongoing and continuous disadvantage and social disorder as may be seen in other cases of Aboriginal offenders. 

82The Applicant's position in this respect was referred to by Smart J in the 1997 judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to earlier (at [41]). The 1994 sexual assaults were committed at a time when the Applicant had these stable influences in his life. He committed the 2005 offences whilst still having the benefit of stable family support.

83In giving full weight to the Applicant's disadvantaged background, it remains necessary to take proper account, as well, of his long-standing criminal history for a variety of offences. In particular, the sexual assault offences committed in 1994, again involving a victim who was a stranger assaulted at knifepoint, remain significant matters to be taken into account on sentence. As the sentencing Judge in this case observed, the Applicant was not suffering from any mental condition at that time. 

84Proper regard should be had to the Applicant's mental health issues in accordance with Bugmy v The Queen at 1033 [47]-[48], in light of the sentencing Judge's findings on this issue which are, in my view, clearly correct.

85The total effective sentence imposed upon the Applicant was a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 13 November 2007 and expiring on 12 November 2017, with an additional term of three years and four months commencing on 13 November 2017 and expiring on 12 March 2021.

86The total effective sentence is a substantial one. However, the Applicant's crimes were of considerable gravity. The conflicting purposes of punishment point to the need for substantial sentences in this case, bearing in mind, amongst other things, the need to protect the community: Bugmy v The Queen at 1032 [44].

87The evidence concerning the Applicant's progress in custody and his experiences, including family bereavements, is relevant to the application. 

88In a manner similar to a life sentence redetermination application, the Court has (to an extent) the advantage of hindsight when approaching the question of sentence: ASP v R [2007] NSWSC 339 at [273]. However, this evidence does not operate entirely in the Applicant's favour. There have been occasions in 2008, 2011 and September 2013 when he has not been medication compliant, a scenario which existed in 2005 when these offences were committed. Although some progress has been made, concern remains with respect to the risk of reoffending and protection of the community. The Applicant continues to lack insight into his sexual offending conduct, which has seen grave crimes of this type committed against separate victims in 1994 and 2005. The Applicant has expressed willingness to undertake a sex offender's program in custody. It is to be hoped that he is given this opportunity in the balance of his non-parole period.

89The Applicant's reliance upon sentencing statistics and reference to other sentencing decisions is of very limited assistance: Abdul v R at [66]-[71].

90Utilising the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period as guideposts, in accordance with the principles in Muldrock, and having regard to all matters relevant to the question of sentence, a conclusion should not be reached that a lesser period of imprisonment ought be imposed upon the Applicant for these crimes. 

91There is force in the Crown submission that some measure of accumulation was appropriate as between the two s.61J offences. The offences were different in nature, committed in different locations near the abandoned house. The first s.61J offence caused the victim to retch, before she was subjected to the separate act of indignity giving rise to the second s.61J offence. Even if some reduction of the s.61J sentences was considered appropriate, the process of accumulation would see no lesser total effective sentence being imposed.

92There is a further aspect of the Applicant's case which operates against him on this application. Reference has already been made to the sentences of imprisonment imposed at the Port Macquarie District Court on 16 October 2008, being entirely concurrent sentences of imprisonment for unrelated offences. 

93In approaching the question of sentence at this time, including the question whether substantial injustice would flow if this Court declined to extend time, it is appropriate to take into account the lengthy sentences of imprisonment which the Applicant has served for entirely unrelated offences, whilst at the same time serving the present sentences. 

94If the Applicant had been sentenced for these other matters at the same time as the present sexual assault offences, it would have been inevitable, in accordance with relevant principles, that a significant measure of accumulation would have resulted. It appears from the transcript of sentencing proceedings that the Applicant considered joining up the Port Macquarie matters so that he could be sentenced at the one time, but elected not to do so (T6, 1 May 2008; T12, 29 August 2008).

95This Court should approach the matter upon the basis that, should an extension of time be granted and this Court proceed to resentencing, a significant measure of accumulation would be necessary to give effect to sentences for the present offences, in addition to separate sentences for unrelated offences committed by the Applicant. 

96In circumstances where the primary question is whether an extension of time ought be granted, with attention being given to the question whether substantial injustice would result if that did not occur, then this additional circumstance operates significantly and adversely to the Applicant.

Conclusion

97The present application was filed four years and 10 months after sentence was passed on 29 August 2008. The sole ground of appeal relied upon is the Muldrock ground. The Applicant had initiated appellate action after sentence in 2008, but had not proceeded with it in circumstances where legal aid was refused. The present application may be appropriately characterised as one based solely upon the change in law arising from Muldrock.

98An examination of the sentences imposed, and consideration of those sentences by reference to correct legal principles and the facts of the case, together with the interests of the community and the victim, leads to the conclusion that the discretion to grant an extension of time to appeal should not be exercised in this case. If an extension of time had been granted, a conclusion would have been reached that no lesser sentences were warranted for the purpose of s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

99I propose that the Court refuse an extension of time to seek leave to appeal against sentence under s.10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

100BELLEW J: I agree with Johnson J.

2705869,George v R [2013] NSWCCA 263,"Judgment

1HOEBEN CJ at CL:
Offences and sentence
The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder contrary to s27 of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years. The offence has a standard non-parole period of 10 years.

2On 1 September 2009 the applicant was sentenced by Ellis DCJ to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 11 years and 5 months with a balance of term of 3 years and 9 months. The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release on parole is 17 March 2019.

3The applicant seeks an extension of time for leave to appeal against the severity of this sentence. He relies upon a single ground of appeal:

Ground 1: His Honour erred in his approach to the standard non-parole period legislation in the light of the principles identified in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.

4The Crown does not concede that ""Muldrock error"" has occurred. If ""Muldrock error"" has occurred the Crown does not concede that pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour is warranted in law. The Crown does not consent to an extension of time being granted.

Factual background to the offence

5On 17 October 2007 the victim was in a relationship with the applicant, who was then aged 24. He was aged 26 at the time of sentence and is now aged 30. The victim lived in West Ryde with her six year old son from a previous relationship. On that day the victim left her home to collect her son from school and the applicant went to the West Ryde Hotel.

6At about 5pm the victim went to the hotel to meet the applicant, who was drinking in the beer garden. Thereafter, the applicant was heard to verbally abuse the victim. She recalled that at some stage during the night he threw his beer over her. 

7About five minutes later, the applicant said ""Come on"" and led the victim into the back lane, next to the beer garden. CCTV showed the applicant taking hold of the victim by the upper arm and pulling her along the lane until both were lost from view.

8Two minutes later the applicant returned to the hotel alone. It is now known that while the applicant and the victim were in the back lane, he shot the victim in the back of the head. The victim was not sure what had happened to her, but thought she might have been shot in the head, because she could not move and she had seen the applicant with a pistol the day before. After the victim was shot, she tried to crawl back to the hotel but could not move very far. The victim was taken to Westmead Hospital and told the nursing staff that her boyfriend had shot her.

9She was found to have a 5 millimetre wide puncture wound to the left occipital head and a right side weakness. A CT scan confirmed that she had bullet fragments lodged in her skull and brain. She underwent two urgent operative procedures over the next five days. The second of those operations included a left occipitoparietal craniectomy, an excision of foreign bodies and a titanium mesh cranioplasty. Deep metal fragments, adjacent to the brain stem, were not removed due to the serious risk of complication. She was transferred from Westmead Hospital to the Ryde Brain Injury Unit on 5 December 2007 for ongoing rehabilitation. 

10The victim has been left with significant long-term disabilities. Those are:
(a) A loss of vision, which is permanent, and means she will be unable to operate a motor vehicle in the future. Her loss of vision to the right side is total.

(b) She has ataxic incoordination of all limbs, due to the injury to the cerebellum. She will have continued difficulty for the rest of her life which will include a tremor, slowness and clumsiness of the hands so as to make feeding, day to day hygiene and self-care difficult. Her writing and ability to dress herself are impaired. She requires assistance with small objects such as buttons. She will have life-long difficulty with fine coordination of the hands and will have mobility problems for the rest of her life. She will require an electric wheelchair for community access. There will be a lifelong increased risk of falls and fractures. 

(c) She has slurring of her speech, which is permanent, and which will affect verbal communication. Feeding and eating will be slower and will require effort.

(d) The metal bullet fragments remaining in her brain present an ongoing risk of further injury from migration and infection. The victim's future work and recreation activities will be significantly limited.

11When interviewed by the police, the applicant denied any involvement in the offence. He could not explain why the victim would have nominated him as her assailant and said that they did not get along very well and that she had made allegations of assault against him before.

12Two other persons, who were at the hotel, gave evidence that they saw the applicant spit in the victim's drink and among other things, say to her ""Bitch you had better get a tattoo of Rosie across your forehead because that is where the bullet hole is going to be ..."" ""I'm going to put a bullet in your head.""

13As already indicated, after having been arrested the applicant pleaded guilty to the offence and was given an 18 percent discount for that plea of guilty by the sentencing judge. The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was remorseful and had accepted responsibility for what he had done.

14The sentencing judge made the following observations concerning the standard non-parole period:

""This is a very serious criminal offence as is apparent when one looks at the maximum penalty applicable. Obviously in any offence there will be a range of offending against a particular section from the low end of criminality through to the high or worse case category. The standard non-parole period of ten years does not strictly apply because this is not a midrange offence after trial. Nevertheless it remains a not insignificant guide post to this court and in conjunction with the maximum penalty provides a clear indication of the community's attitude to offences of this type. The level of criminality is an important factor which this court must determine and there are a number of matters which are relevant to this court's consideration of the level of criminality in this case."" (ROS 6.9 - 7.3)

His Honour then set out a number of considerations which were relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence.

15The conclusion arrived at by the sentencing judge was:

""It seems to me when one looks at the detail of the offending on the particular night and the immediate and long-term consequences to the victim that this is an offence which, if not in the worst category, is certainly in the high range category of offending against this particular provision. It is probably fair to say that it is always possible to think of a worse case and certainly some of the cases which the court has considered of recent time both in the process of this sentence as well as for another sentence under the same section, provide more heinous examples of this crime than this particular one. Nevertheless, it is certainly a very serious offence and it is in the upper range of criminality and the maximum penalty of twenty-five years should be very much to the fore in this court's consideration in determining the appropriate penalty."" (ROS 9.9 - 10.3)

16Later his Honour said:

""The court generally has taken into account a number of recent decisions by the Court of Criminal Appeal in relation to the application of standard non parole periods all of which ultimately follow the guidelines set out in R v Way and cases such as R v AP.

It is clear that where the standard non parole period does not specifically apply, there must still be some relationship to it. Here, had this been a finding of guilt after trial, the standard non parole period would still not have specifically applied because of the court's finding that this is not a mid range offence but rather an upper range offence. It is not appropriate to deal with these things mathematically but interestingly if the normal statutory ratio is applied to a non parole period of ten years that produces a head sentence of thirteen years and four months. So leaving aside discounts for plea of guilty, it would seem to suggest that a sentence of thirteen years and four months would be an appropriate guide for mid range offences. The starting point for this sentence is significantly higher than that given the fact that the criminality is higher than mid range."" (ROS 10.7 - 11.3)

17His Honour then took into account the applicant's subjective case, in particular his brutal upbringing and the reports of Dr Allnutt, psychiatrist. The applicant's brother gave evidence as to the applicant's difficult and problematic upbringing. There had been a number of placements in different homes and much violence during his youth. The reports of Dr Allnutt made it clear that at the time of the offending, the applicant was not only intoxicated but had been taking ice over the preceding days. Dr Allnutt said:

""Overall it would be fair to say that his developmental course was likely characterised by neglect and abuse and then he manifested juvenile delinquency in childhood and would be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder in adulthood.""

18Dr Allnutt identified psychiatric issues which were operating at the time of the offending. Dr Allnutt said that if the applicant's self-report were reliable, it could be stated that at the time of the offending he was experiencing symptoms consistent with a disease of the mind, however:

""I do not believe, however, that at the material time of the alleged offence your client suffered a defect of reason to the extent that he was significantly impaired in his capacity to know the nature and quality of his actions or the wrongfulness of his actions, so as to have a defence of mental illness available to him.""

19Dr Allnutt recorded a history of ""auditory phenomena"" (voices egging him on). Dr Allnutt thought that from his presentation in prison after his arrest, it was possible that he was psychotic at the material time, even though Dr Allnutt was not able to reach that conclusion. Dr Allnutt did say:

""However, the underlying feature probably active to some degree at the material time that the alleged offence occurred was his chronic schizophrenia.""

Dr Allnutt was not able to apportion a relative weighting to any of the factors which he identified, i.e. the applicant's feelings of resentment and anger against the victim, his intoxication with alcohol and ice and his chronic schizophrenia.

20His Honour's conclusion on this issue was:

""The court accepts that the background of this offender was extremely abusive and deprived and that he was a witness to violence from an early age and that he does have an underlying mental health issue and has consequently had issues in relation to substance abuse."" (ROS 15.5)

""The court is unable to conclude that he is unlikely to re-offend and unable to conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation. The court would need to be prescient to determine what his prospects of rehabilitation are. The court acknowledges that he has shown remorse. The court acknowledges that he may not have been fully aware of the consequences of his actions by reason of his mental health condition as previously noted ..."" (ROS 16.9)

21Having reviewed the evidence, his Honour expressed his overall conclusion as follows:

""Having looked at the cases the court is of the view that it is likely that a case which is found to be a worse case category offence is likely to produce a sentence in the range of 20 to 25 years, given that theoretically the 25 year maximum is reserved for the worst case. In the court's view it is likely that offences found to be in the upper range will fall within the range of 16 years to 20 years and in the court's view the appropriate commencement point for this particular offence, having regard to what I consider to be a very high level of criminality and notwithstanding those mental health issues to which I have referred, is a starting point of 18 years and 6 months. ..."" (ROS 17.7)

Background to this application

22After having been sentenced on 1 September 2009 the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in respect of his sentence on 20 October 2009. On 17 May 2010 the applicant was refused legal aid because Legal Aid NSW did not consider that the appeal had reasonable prospects of success in accordance with the Legal Aid merit test.

23On 14 June 2012 the applicant again submitted a Notice of Intention to Appeal and an Application for Extension of Time. On 22 June 2012 the Registrar wrote to the applicant advising that his application to file a fresh Notice of Intention to Appeal had been refused.

24Between 28 August 2012 and 20 September 2012 the applicant's legal aid file was reviewed to determine whether the sentence might be susceptible to review due to ""Muldrock error"". On 27 June 2013 an appeal was prepared for filing in the Court of Criminal Appeal which has resulted in the matter coming before the Court.

25For a general background to applications of this kind and ""Muldrock error"", this judgment should be read with Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.

Delay

26The sentence was imposed on 1 September 2009. The Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed within time but was not pursued and lapsed. Accordingly, an extension of time of over 3½ years is sought for this application for leave to appeal against sentence.

27The competing submissions in relation to delay and finality, and the Court's consideration of those submissions, are set out in Abdul v R at [31] - [53]. Those submissions and the Court's conclusions in relation thereto are incorporated into this judgment.

28The extent of the delay is substantial and the explanation for it is not compelling. Having considered the circumstances relating to the applicant's sentence, Legal Aid NSW rejected his application as having insufficient prospects of success. The only change to those circumstances is the decision in Muldrock. The principle of finality stands against an extension of time as does the potential for further psychological suffering by the victim. 

29In those circumstances, the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion to determine whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted is determinative in this matter. None of the other factors identified in the decided cases favour the granting of an extension of time.

30If ""Muldrock error"" is not made out, there is no explanation for delay and no basis for a submission that had s54B(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 been correctly applied, a lesser sentence would have been imposed. In the absence of any other grounds of appeal, that would be the end of the matter.

Was there Muldrock error?

31The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge erred by:

(a) Adopting a two stage approach to sentencing.

(b) Approaching the sentencing exercise on the basis that the standard non-parole period was effectively a starting point.

(c) Giving determinative significance to the standard non-parole period.

(d) Failing to make proper allowance for the applicant's subjective case on sentence contrary to Muldrock.

32The applicant accepted that in his initial reference to the standard non-parole period, his Honour had correctly described it as a guidepost. The applicant does not take issue with the observations of the sentencing judge at [14] hereof. The applicant submitted, however, that the observations by the sentencing judge at [16] hereof demonstrated error. The error was that he used the standard non-parole period as a springboard or as a starting point and as a result, the standard non-parole period drove the sentence to be imposed on the applicant in the sense of it having determinative significance.

33The applicant submitted that the over emphasis on the standard non-parole period prevented the sentencing judge giving adequate weight to his very strong subjective case with particular reference to his chronic schizophrenia and that this condition was operating at the time of the offence and was causally related to it. The applicant submitted that notwithstanding that the mental condition was referred to and discussed, the consideration of it was overwhelmed by the significance given to the standard non-parole period which drove the sentence. The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed did not adequately reflect the significant matters in his subjective case, i.e. his mental health condition, his appalling upbringing and his remorse.

34I am not satisfied that ""Muldrock error"" has occurred. When considering that question, it is necessary to consider the reasoning of the sentencing judge as a whole: Essex v R [2013] NSWCCA 11 at [30]; Aldous v R [2012] NSWCCA 153 at [2] and Zreika v R [2012] NSWCCA 44 at [43].

35The totality of his Honour's comments in relation to the standard non-parole period has been set out at [14], [15], [16] and [21]. As the applicant accepted, the first observation is unexceptionable and is consistent with the guidance provided by Muldrock. It gives the standard non-parole period no greater emphasis than the maximum penalty so that both operate as guideposts.

36It is the observation at [16] which is criticised. With respect, that criticism is unmerited. There is no error in the statement that where the standard non-parole period does not specifically apply ""there must still be some relationship to it"". That does no more than indicate that the standard non-parole period is to be regarded as a guidepost. Similarly, the comment ""It is not appropriate to deal with these things mathematically ..."" is also unexceptionable and fully consistent with Muldrock.

37The balance of that observation by the sentencing judge ""... but interestingly if the normal statutory ratio is applied to a non parole period of ten years that produces a head sentence of thirteen years and four months"" might have revealed error if it formed part of his Honour's reasoning leading up to the sentence ultimately passed. It did not. It comprises nothing more than some musing on the part of the sentencing judge. As the balance of the quotation makes clear, his Honour effectively disregarded the standard non-parole period because he assessed the objective seriousness of the offence as ""significantly higher than mid-range"".

38As can be seen from the quotation from his Honour's reasons at [21], what his Honour gave significant weight to was the maximum penalty for the offence. The standard non-parole period played no part in his Honour's reasoning towards the start point of the sentence ultimately imposed. His Honour only reached that start point after taking into account those factors which impacted on the objective seriousness of the offence and the results of his comprehensive review of the applicant's subjective case. This is very much in line with the ""instinctive synthesis"" approach described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 which was expressly approved in Muldrock.

39It is not an error for a sentencing judge to make a finding of objective seriousness (Zrieka v R at [45] - [46]). On the contrary, Muldrock emphasised the importance of an assessment of ""objective seriousness"" in the sentencing process (at [27]). There are a number of decisions of this Court that postdate the decision in Muldrock to the effect that it is not an inappropriate exercise for a sentencing judge to make an evaluation of the objective seriousness of an offence (Zarakas v R [2013] NSWCCA 144 at [35]).

40A proper reading of the sentencing remarks does not demonstrate the errors identified in Muldrock. As already indicated, the sentencing judge applied an instinctive synthesis approach consistent with Markarian, whereby he determined the appropriate sentence after identifying all relevant factors and their significance. His consideration of the objective gravity of the applicant's offence was part of that process of instinctive synthesis leading to the formulation of the sentence which was imposed. 

41It is not correct to say that his Honour's consideration of the applicant's mental condition was overwhelmed by the significance given to the standard non-parole period. His Honour devoted a substantial portion of his remarks to a consideration of the applicant's background and in particular, the evidence of Dr Allnutt relating to his mental condition. On the contrary, if the applicant's mental health issues and his brutal childhood had not been taken into account, the applicant would properly have been facing a sentence which was much closer to the maximum available, given the objective seriousness of the offending.

42This ground of appeal has not been made out.

43If I am wrong in my assessment of whether Muldrock error has occurred, I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted in law and should be passed.

44A consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence makes this clear. There was a significant level of determination to achieve the intended outcome of murder. The extent of the injuries and the pain associated with them was substantial. The long term impact of these injuries on the victim has been devastating and involves the destruction of her quality of life. There was no provocation or contributory conduct by the victim. In the position in which she found herself, the victim was vulnerable to an execution style killing which was the intended outcome.

45While the applicant's deprived and brutal upbringing has to be given full weight, the evidence as to the influence of his mental illness at the time is somewhat equivocal. The applicant was clearly aware of what he was doing and that it was wrong. His intoxication by alcohol and drugs complicated an assessment of his mental illness. While his Honour accepted that his chronic schizophrenia was active to some degree at the time, its extent was unknown. Those significant mental health considerations, of course, had to be looked at against the nature of the offence and the need to protect the public.

46The applicant's reliance upon statistics is not decisive on the s6(3) issue. In MA and Pham v R [2007] NSWCCA 240, RA Hulme J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreed) said at [91]:

""91 Subliminal in the reference to the statistics and the observation that the sentences here fall into the highest end of the range is the proposition that that is indicative of error. The proposition must be rejected. As this Court has said on many occasions, the range extends to the maximum penalty set by Parliament and it is against that that an offender's conduct must primarily be judged. Certainly, the statistics may at times inspire further reflection on the sentence in a particular case and perhaps give some limited guidance but, of themselves, they do not demonstrate error. Particularly is this so because, within each category, they provide no details of the cases reflected in them.""

47That observation has particular relevance to this case where the factual circumstances are so complex. There is nothing in the post sentence events which would support the proposition that a lesser sentence is warranted in law.

48The order which I propose is that the application for extension of time by the applicant be dismissed.

49JOHNSON J: I agree with the reasons of Hoeben CJ at CL and the order proposed by his Honour. Further, I agree with the additional comments of Latham J.

50LATHAM J: I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL. I would only add that the applicant's submission that his Honour used the standard non parole period as a ""springboard"" from which he determined the ultimate sentence is not supported by the judge's suggestion that "" a sentence of thirteen years and four months would be an appropriate guide for mid range offences"". It is critical to bear in mind that the error identified in Muldrock is to commence with an assessment of an offence as one relative to mid range objective gravity and then to ask whether other factors justify a longer or shorter period than the standard non parole period. The detection of Muldrock error is not assisted by calling in aid metaphors such as ""springboard"", any more than the use of metaphors such as ""benchmark"" or ""guidepost"" definitively determines the absence of Muldrock error. As Allsop P said in Williams v R [2012] NSWCCA 172 at [4], ""metaphors are apt to conceal as much as illuminate.""

2705870,Tan v R [2013] NSWCCA 262,"Judgment
1HOEBEN CJ at CL:Offence and sentenceOn 8 October 2008 the applicant was found guilty by a jury of an offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, contrary to s33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 25 years and there is a standard non-parole period of 7 years.  The offence occurred on 30 September 2007.  The applicant was also found guilty of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm committed between 1 and 30 September 2007 upon the same victim, contrary to s59(1) Crimes Act 1900.  The maximum penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 5 years.
2On 23 December 2008 the applicant was sentenced by Finnane DCJ as follows:
(a) For the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a fixed term of imprisonment of 3 years commencing 30 September 2007 and expiring 29 September 2010.
(b) For the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing 30 September 2008 and expiring 29 September 2014, with a balance of term of 4 years expiring 29 September 2018.
3The total effective term of imprisonment was therefore imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years and a balance of term of 4 years.  The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 29 September 2014.
4The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed in respect of the offence contrary to s33(1)(b) of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.  That application for extension of time is opposed by the Crown.
5The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal:
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in the way the applicable standard non-parole period was taken into account.
Ground 2:  In his assessment of objective seriousness, his Honour took into account irrelevant and inaccurate considerations.
6It was common ground between the applicant and the Crown that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred in the sentencing process in that the sentencing judge had adopted a two-stage approach and gave primary significance to the standard non-parole period by focusing on whether there were reasons for not imposing it.  On that issue generally, this judgment should be read with Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247.
Factual background to the offence
7The victim came to Australia from Malaysia on a student visa but with the intention of working at the Wild Orchid brothel in Sydney, run by a woman referred to in the proceedings as ""Mummy"".  The applicant met the victim while she was working in this capacity and they formed a relationship.  They had been living together for about six months in an apartment in the city when these offences occurred.  The applicant is a strongly built man and the victim is a relatively slightly built woman.
8On an occasion during September 2007 the applicant commenced interrogating the victim because of his belief that she was involved in a scam marriage with the son of ""Mummy"".  She denied this.  The applicant assaulted her in the context of trying to get information from her.
9The victim's evidence was that he kicked her once in the back.  He kept questioning her and she was hit again.  He used his closed fist.  She was hit to the middle of the forehead and both eyes.  It affected her eyes and both eyes were bleeding.  He punched her three or four times.  He punched her fairly hard with his full force.  She was then kicked somewhere in the lower or middle of her back and just below the right shoulder blade.  The assault lasted about half an hour.  
10Another element of this offence was that the applicant kept asking her questions and said ""If you don't tell me the truth I will kill you"".  He was holding a cleaver for cutting pork when he said that.  He hit her on the head with the blunt side of the cleaver.  
11The victim did not go to the hospital.  She took Panadol and some Chinese medicine because he told her to take medication otherwise he would kill her.  After she took that medication, she felt dizzy and had a headache but the applicant took his belt, put it round her neck and pulled her.  He was laughing.  The belt was very tight and she tried to resist with her hand and kicked him.  He held it around her neck for about five minutes.  The applicant then put a small wet towel on her face and continued to laugh.  He kicked her in the back again.  These were the matters which formed the basis of the applicant's conviction for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
12The victim's evidence was that on the evening of 30 September 2007 the applicant again assaulted her, following further argument about the same issue.  She said that when he hit her it was painful and blood was coming out of her eyes.  She fell to the ground.  He lifted a clothes-stand made of steel and hit her with that on her shoulder.  He hit her with the knuckles of a closed fist, first to the left eye which was not very painful, but after that on the right eye.  He punched her once to the left eye and three times to the right eye with his full force.  Her vision was not good, it was blurred, there was bruising and her eyes were swollen so it was very hard to see.
13She was taken to hospital that night.  She had an operation on her right eye on 8 October 2007.  She could not see well because of the bleeding and bruising and her eyes were half closed.  After the operation, she attended for a regular check-up every month and at the time of trial, her eyes had recovered.  
14The victim was cross-examined about a statement which she gave to a police officer on the night of 30 September 2007 at the hospital.  That statement, which was confirmed by her in cross-examination, was to the effect that the applicant hit her many times to the face, kicked her and hit her with a belt, beat her earlier that night for an hour, had been beating her for two weeks and that she was in a lot of pain.
15Evidence was given by Dr Tybell from the Emergency Department of Sydney Hospital as follows:
""Allegedly struck by fist to face, chest and neck.  Patient stated previous assault by assailant approximately one week ago.  On examination a very swollen right cheek and pre-ocular region with some old discolouration.  Moderately swollen left cheek with some old discolouration ""bruising"".  Abrasions linear and bruising to neck.  Abrasions ""linear"" and contusions to anterior chest wall.""
16A CT scan showed bilateral orbital floor fractures with soft tissue in right fracture.  The doctor explained what this meant in lay terms:
""Basically the orbital floor is the rim on which your eyeball and muscles and the fat that surround it sort of sit more or less.  When you get breakage of that it can be called blow-out, which means some of the tissue can go through the crack or the piece that's in the bottom of the floor ...  if you could imagine there's a hole in the roof, that actually drops down because of a compressive force and you end up with some of the tissue that exists here sliding down into the gap that's created"".
17The doctor said that the injuries to each eye were consistent with each eye being struck separately with a fist.  Each injury would require ""a significant amount of force and quite a heavy blow to break those bones in general and particularly with the right eye where there was the blow-out fracture and the floor was depressed"".  The doctor said that it would take significant force to do that.
18In her Victim Impact Statement, which was before the court, the victim said:""Since the incident I have been in constant pain.  I have not been able to eat or sleep well.  I have nightmares about the applicant constantly.  I feel so scared for my safety that I can't leave home.  Even now I can't sleep some nights from constantly thinking about what [the applicant] had done to me ...""
19These were the matters which formed the basis of the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
20After the incident of 30 September 2007 the applicant walked the victim to her place of work and facilitated the police being contacted.  The applicant was saying, however, that it was one of the bouncers at the Wild Orchid who had caused the injuries, not himself.  When police arrived shortly after 7.50pm and saw the victim they drove her to Sydney Hospital.
Applicant's Subjective Case
21The applicant's subjective case was as follows.  He was born in 1975, being aged 32 at the time of the offences and 33 when sentenced.  He was born in a small village in Malaysia.  His father died when he was aged 3 and he grew up in impoverished circumstances with his mother, stepfather and three brothers.  He was not schooled past primary school level because of lack of money.  He had jobs in restaurants, on construction sites and manufacturing bicycle tyres.  The applicant said he was beaten by his stepfather and left home at age 15.
22The applicant had no previous convictions in Australia.  He said that he was addicted to drugs as a young man and on two occasions in Malaysia was gaoled for 12 months for using ""ice"".  It was not clear whether he had engaged in drug use in Australia.
23The applicant arrived in Australia on 6 April 2006.  Although arriving on a three month tourist visa, he intended to work.  He overstayed his visa because he wanted to earn some money.  He worked in Victoria as a fruit picker and in Sydney in the construction industry.
24The applicant offered to assist police with information about scams connected with the victim and the brother of ""Mummy"", involving false passports and false bank statements.  There was evidence from a police officer that the applicant had provided some information to police, but they were not taking any further action in connection with it.  His Honour took into account as a mitigating factor that he had tried to help the police.
Post-Sentence Events
25In relation to events which had occurred after sentence, the applicant appears to have taken advantage of some educational opportunities while in custody, including taking English language and anger management classes.  He said that he did not receive any visits from family and that this made him feel depressed.  He accepted that he had had a fight with another prisoner in May 2009 and that he had failed urine tests on 11 March 2010 and 12 August 2013.  While in custody, the applicant had indicated a willingness to attend the Getting Smart program and was on the waiting list for the Intensive Drug Treatment Program (IDTP).
26The applicant has not expressed any remorse or contrition nor is there any indication of insight into his responsibility for the offences.  
Background to this application
27After having been sentenced on 23 December 2008, the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in respect of his conviction and sentence on 30 December 2008.  On 21 October 2009 the applicant was advised that Legal Aid NSW had refused to grant him legal aid to pursue those appeals.
28On 17 May 2013 Legal Aid NSW advised the applicant that his case had been reviewed and he was invited to complete a further application for legal aid, based on ""Muldrock error"".  In due course the applicant did so which has resulted in this matter coming before the Court.
29Although the parties accepted that ""Muldrock error"" had occurred, the Crown did not accept that, pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law.
Delay
30The sentence was imposed on 23 December 2008.  The Notice of Intention to Appeal of 30 December 2008 lapsed.  Accordingly, an extension of time of about 4½ years is sought by this application for leave to appeal against sentence.
31The competing submissions in relation to delay, finality and the Court's consideration of those submissions are set out in Abdul v R at [31] - [53].  Those submissions and the Court's conclusions in relation thereto are incorporated into this judgment.
32The extent of the delay is substantial and the explanation for it is not compelling.  Having considered the circumstances relating to the applicant's sentence, Legal Aid NSW rejected his application as having insufficient prospects of success.  The only change to those circumstances is the decision in Muldrock.  The principle of finality stands against an extension of time, as does the potential for further psychological suffering by the victim.
33In those circumstances, the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion to determine whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted, is determinative.  None of the other factors identified in the decided cases favour the granting of an extension of time.
Ground 1:  His Honour erred in the way the applicable standard non-parole period was taken into account.
Ground 2:  In his assessment of objective seriousness, his Honour took into account irrelevant and inaccurate considerations.
Submissions
34The substantial issue in this matter is whether material error having been established, this Court should in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion, impose a lesser sentence because a lesser sentence is warranted in law (s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW)).  In accordance with Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 the Court is to re-exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles.  That is not to say that the findings of the sentencing judge are to be ignored but the applicant does not have to establish that the sentence was manifestly excessive before this Court can consider whether a lesser sentence is warranted.  In re-exercising the sentencing discretion, the Court may have regard to evidence of post-sentence events (Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154).
35The sentencing judge assessed the objective seriousness of the offence at above mid-range.  The applicant submitted that this assessment of objective seriousness was excessive because the injuries sustained by the victim were not particularly serious and because his Honour had made factual errors when recording the circumstances relating to the offence.
36The applicant submitted that while the injuries may have been potentially serious, the victim had fully recovered from them by the time of the trial.  He submitted that the victim had not been kept in hospital after examination and that the operation which she underwent was not urgent.  The applicant submitted that the result of an offender's conduct was a particularly relevant feature in relation to sentences imposed for contraventions of s33.  The applicant relied upon the observation of Howie J in R v Mitchell; R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [27] where his Honour said that the nature of the injury caused to the victim would, to a very significant degree, determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence.
37In relation to factual errors, the applicant submitted that it was incorrect to say that he had kicked the victim for half an hour and that he had used a long brown belt in that offence.  The applicant submitted that it was incorrect to say that the victim's cheekbones were fractured, or that the injury was such as to risk the contents of her eye falling from the eye socket.  He submitted that it was incorrect for his Honour to say that unless the applicant had received medical attention fairly quickly, she could have suffered extremely serious consequences and perhaps even died.
38The applicant asked that the Court take into account that no weapon was used and that the offence was not found to have been planned in any way.  The applicant submitted that the Court should take into account that he was a man of good character insofar as Australia was concerned and that his conditions of custody in Australia were harsh because of lack of visits or support from family.
Consideration
39The factual errors were not as great as submitted by the applicant, although there were some.  The victim's statement to the police on the night of the incident referred to her being beaten for an hour, but did not refer to her being kicked for half an hour.  That statement also referred to her being kicked during the course of the attack and being hit with a belt.  While it was, strictly speaking, incorrect to say that the victim's cheekbones were fractured, the lower part of both orbits were fractured which are contiguous to what is commonly known as the cheekbone. Both cheekbones were swollen. The reference to the ""eye falling from the eye socket"" was a shorthand way of describing what Dr Tybell said at [16] hereof.  It was, however, quite incorrect to say that the injuries were such that they may have caused the victim's death.
40I do not regard these errors to be of particular significance.  It needs to be remembered that the judgment was given ex tempore at the conclusion of the sentence submissions.  As his Honour appreciated, it was not only the injuries themselves which were of significance, but the circumstances in which they were inflicted.  In AM v R [2012] NSWCCA 203 Johnson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Garling J agreed) said:
""73 The absence of planning and premeditation is relevant to objective gravity, although this feature may be diminished (as a factor favouring the offender) given the requisite intention for a s.33 offence: R v Zamagias at [14]. This is expressly so where the attack is sustained and there are opportunities for the offender to desist from the attack but he does not do so: R v Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 161 at [17].  ...""
41The attack was savage and sustained.  Dr Tybell pointed out that a significant amount of force and quite a heavy blow was required to break the orbital bones.  It was incorrect to say that no weapon was used in the course of the beating, because the victim was struck with a clothes-stand made of steel.
42The applicant's submissions focused entirely upon the physical injuries received by the victim, but said nothing about the psychological injuries.  In her Victim Impact Statement of 8 November 2008 the applicant stated that she had been in constant pain since the incident, had not been able to eat or sleep well and had constant nightmares about the applicant.  She said ""I feel so scared for my safety that I can't leave home.  Even now I can't sleep some nights from constantly thinking about what [the applicant] had done to me. ...""
43The applicant's submissions in relation to the objective seriousness of the offence, made no mention of the maximum penalty for this offence which is imprisonment for 25 years.  In that regard, there is some incongruity in the legislature providing that the standard non-parole period for a ""mid-range offence"" is imprisonment for 7 years when compared with the maximum penalty.  In any event, as a result of Muldrock, a sentencing court is not to focus upon the standard non-parole period but is to treat it as a guidepost just like the maximum sentence for the relevant offence. 
44In that regard, the observations by Johnson J in AM v R are of assistance:
""67 The maximum sentence of 25 years' imprisonment indicates the seriousness with which an offence under s.33 is regarded: R v Zhang at [28]. As Howie J observed in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [11], the offence carries the highest maximum penalty prescribed by the legislature short of life imprisonment.
68 The seriousness of s.33 offences is emphasised, as well, by the intention required to commit an offence under the section. Intention to cause grievous bodily harm is the mental element for murder, in the event that the victim died: R v Zoef [2005] NSWCCA 268 at [113]; R v Mitchell at 101 [27]. It is this mental element that makes an individual offender liable to a maximum penalty of 25 years, as opposed to 10 years for a s.35(2) offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm: R v Mitchell at 101 [27].""
45Finally, an assessment of the objective seriousness of an offence has always been regarded as a discretionary exercise by the sentencing judge.  There have been a number of statements by this Court to the effect that the Court should be slow to depart from a sentencing judge's conclusion as to objective seriousness of an offence:  (R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430; Perry v R [2006] NSWCCA 351; 166 A Crim R 383; Stanford v R [2007] NSWCCA 73; R v Fisher [2008] NSWCCA 103).
46In Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 Spigelman CJ (Simpson J agreeing) said at [37]:
""37 Characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in performing the task of finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts.  This Court is very slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion.  The question must be whether or not the particular characterisation which her Honour gave to the circumstances of the offence was open to her Honour.  In my opinion it was open, although I have some hesitation in deciding so and find it to be at the lower end of the range which could reasonably be held to be so characterised.""
An observation to similar effect was made by Simpson J at [46].
47I have concluded that his Honour's finding that the offence was greater than mid-range was open to him, even allowing for the inaccuracies in his recitation of the facts.  There is no error in that finding.  In his assessment of relevant considerations, his Honour entirely omitted the use of the steel clothes-stand to hit the victim during the incident and omitted reference to the abrasions and bruising occasioned to her neck and chest.  He made no reference to the importance of the intention element in s33 offences and had little regard to the significance of the maximum penalty.
48In those circumstances, Ground of Appeal 2 has not been made out.
49That does not end the matter.  There still remains the application of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. Since Ground of Appeal 1 has been made out, should this Court in the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion impose a lesser sentence because a lesser sentence is warranted in law?
50In the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion the matters referred to at [12] - [18] remain relevant and have to be taken into account.  Both the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period have to be taken into account as guideposts.  The victim's recovery from the physical effects of her injuries favours a lesser sentence.  On the other hand, the manner of their infliction, the continuing psychological effects and the intent element of the s33(1)(b) offence point the other way.  
51There are some additional considerations.  The fact of the earlier assault occasioning actual bodily harm cannot be ignored.  It also involved a savage attack on the victim in very similar circumstances to count 2.  The sentence imposed for that offence was unaffected by any ""Muldrock error"".  This meant that the s33 offence was not to be considered as an isolated incident, but as part of a course of conduct.  This reinforces the need for specific deterrence and general deterrence to be given particular effect in any sentence passed.  The s33 offence involves a significant escalation in offending which occurred within the space of a week.
52This Court has said on a number of occasions that domestic violence offences should be treated seriously so as to give effect to considerations of specific and general deterrence (Martin v R [2011] NSWCCA 188 at [13] per Fullerton J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreed) and the cases therein cited; Hamid v R [2006] NSWCCA 303; 164 A Crim R 179 at [86] per Johnson J (with whom Hunt AJA and Latham J agreed)).  The sentence to be imposed for this offence has to also take into account that the offending took place over a substantial period of time.  This was not some reflex reaction on the part of the applicant, but rather a methodical beating inflicted on the victim with the intention of extracting information from her.
53As already observed, no challenge is made to the sentence imposed for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, nor the level of accumulation between that sentence and the sentence currently under consideration.  The sentence imposed for the s33(1)(b) offence is not to be looked at in isolation.  The applicant's subjective case is not greatly assisted by events which have occurred following sentence.  His major complaint is his isolation from his family because of his incarceration.  That, of course, is an inevitable consequence of a foreign national being imprisoned in Australia for offences committed in Australia.
54Taking the above matters into consideration, I am not persuaded that any sentence other than that which was imposed by his Honour is required in law.  This is so because of the particular facts of this case which have been reviewed above.
55It follows that to allow the application for leave to appeal against sentence to proceed would have insufficient prospects of success, so as to justify the considerable extension of time which has been sought.  No ""substantial injustice"" would arise if an extension of time were not granted.   The order which I propose is that the application for extension of time be dismissed.
56JOHNSON J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.
57BELLEW J:  I agree with Hoeben CJ at CL.

2705871,"RATCLIFF, Lillian v R [2013] NSWCCA 259","Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Ms Lillian Ratcliff (the appellant) was charged with two counts of supply of a prohibited drug under s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (Drug Act). Along with Ms Kerry Ann Buckman, whose appeal was heard simultaneously with this appeal, the appellant argued that s 25(1) of the Drug Act was invalid as being inconsistent with Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).

2Freeman DCJ dismissed the appellant's motion to quash the indictment on this ground but granted the appellant a certificate under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 to appeal to this Court.

3The appeal was heard at the same time as the appeal of Ms Buckman and each of the appellant and Ms Buckman adopted the other's submissions. I have set out the legislative framework and summarised the submissions in my judgment in respect of the appeal of Ms Buckman. It is unnecessary to repeat what I have said there.

4For the reasons I have given in my judgment in respect of Ms Buckman's appeal, I am of the view there is no inconsistency between s 25(1) of the Drug Act and Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth). It follows that the appeal should be dismissed.

2705873,McMullen v Regina [2013] NSWCCA 261,"Judgment

1LATHAM J: I agree with Schmidt J. 

2SCHMIDT J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him by Quirk DCJ on 29 November 2012 for three offences committed in December 2010 and January 2011, to which he entered pleas of guilty at the commencement of the trial, before the jury was empanelled. 

3After certain discounts for his pleas, the total term of imprisonment imposed on the applicant was 6 years, with a minimum non-parole period of 4 years commencing from 28 July 2011 and expiring on 27 July 2014 and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 27 July 2017. The individual sentences imposed were:

Count 1 - accessory before the fact to robbery armed with a dangerous weapon - s 97(2) and s 346 of the Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty 25 years - sentenced to:

Total term of 4 years, with a minimum non-parole period of 2 years, 6 months commencing from 28 July 2011 to expire on 27 January 2014 and a balance of term of 1 year, 6 months expiring on 27 July 2015.

Count 2 - conspiracy to commit robbery armed with a dangerous weapon - common law - penalty at large - maximum penalty for statutory offence 25 years under s 97(2) - sentenced to:

Total term of 5 years, 6 months, with a minimum non-parole period of 3 years, 6 months commencing from 28 January 2012 to expire on 27 July 2015 and a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 27 July 2017.

Count 3 - possess unauthorised pistol - s 7(1) Firearms Act 1996 - maximum penalty 14 years - 3 year standard non-parole period - sentenced to:

Total term of 3 years, 5 months, with a minimum non-parole period of 2 years, 3 months commencing from 28 January 2012 to expire on 27 April 2014 and a balance of term of 1 year, 2 months expiring on 27 June 2015.


4Two further offences were taken into account in the sentences imposed for counts 2 and 3 under a Form 1:

Count 2 - steal motor vehicle - s 154F of the Crimes Act 1900 - maximum penalty 10 years.

Count 3 - possess a firearm, a Gap self-loading pistol - s 7(1) of the Firearms Act 1996 - maximum penalty 14 years.


5While the grounds of appeal as originally pleaded raised a complaint of manifestly excessive penalty for count 1, the amended grounds of appeal finally pressed were:

1. In relation to Count 1, the court has erred in not giving effect to the principles of parity. The disparity between the sentences should have been substantially greater.

2. The applicant's participation was found to be equal to that of his co-conspirator Jamie Oatley, but the sentence imposed on the applicant was significantly greater. The court has erred in not giving effect to the principle of parity.


6The facts were agreed. The applicant gave evidence, as did his uncle and a psychiatrist's report was tendered, as well as letters from his uncle and girlfriend, a reference from a former employer, who described him as a hard and enthusiastic worker, recordings of telephone conversations between the applicant and a co-offender and the applicant's case notes and records.

The sentencing judgment

7At trial there was a dispute as to the appropriate discount for the pleas which the applicant had entered. The applicant had been arraigned on an indictment which charged him with 14 counts. The trial was estimated to take about six weeks. After legal argument, one count was amended and pleas were then entered to the three counts pressed. The Crown conceded that in the circumstances the applicant was entitled to a reasonably significant discount, which her Honour determined should be 20% for count 1 and 15% for counts 2 and 3.

8Her Honour explained that count 1 related to a robbery at the West Pennant Hills Sports Club, during which two co-offenders, Justin Bourke and an unidentified male, who were armed with pistols, stole some $87,064 after staff members were threatened with a Glock pistol. The applicant provided the motor vehicle used in that robbery, a stolen Mitsubishi Lancer, which he knew was to be used in the robbery.

9The conspiracy the subject of count 2 involved the stealing of a Mitsubishi Evolution, the purchase of various items, such as balaclavas, hooded jumpers and track pants and a high speed chase, when police sought to arrest the applicant and a co-offender.

10Her Honour noted the applicant's evidence as to his role in this conspiracy to be that he had agreed with the co-offender, Oatley, while in Wellington jail, that he would help him on release. They had become very close whilst in the same pod, which her Honour considered understandable, given the applicant's youth and his lack of contact or family support during his five years in custody.

11Her Honour noted the applicant's evidence that because of his known expertise with stealing motor vehicles, which she observed was evident from the applicant's criminal history, he agreed to steal a car for the purposes of a robbery to be conducted by Oatley and some of his friends. He also agreed to buy various pieces of clothing and other items found on his arrest, because they had no money. That was consistent with the transcripts of the recordings of conversations between the applicant and Oatley.

12The firearms offence the subject of count 3 related to a bag found on the applicant's arrest to contain a Glock pistol, with an attached magazine containing 17 (9mm) Luger rounds and a Gapkal 8 military pistol, with an attached magazine which contained no ammunition. The bag also contained balaclavas, packets of washing up gloves, hooded jumpers, track suit pants, one litre of turpentine, one litre of kerosene, three pairs of shoes, bolt cutters, mobile phones and $5,080 cash. The Crown accepted that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it was the applicant or his co-offender who had brought the firearms found in the joint possession of both offenders, to the scene.

13Her Honour noted that the applicant was cross-examined vigorously about his assertion that he did not intend to participate in the actual robbery and accepted that misplaced loyalty to his friend was the motivation for participating in this conspiracy. Her Honour considered that the applicant's evidence was for the most part straightforward and unembellished, but could not accept his evidence that he had no intention of participating in the actual robbery.

14Her Honour did accept the applicant's evidence, which was consistent with other evidence, that Oatley collected the firearms in a bag from his home and placed them on his lap and although he did not see the firearms, Oatley had informed him that there were firearms in the bag. Her Honour thus accepted that while the firearms belonged to Oatley, contrary to the applicant's case, the participation of each of the co-conspirators was equal, as the Crown submitted.

15Her Honour observed that the applicant was aged 26 at the time of the offences and 28 on sentencing. His parents had separated when he was young and he had not known his father, who he knew had perpetrated domestic abuse and violence against his mother in his early years, forcing them to relocate and change telephone numbers over a period of several years, in order to escape from his harassment and violent actions. His mother entered a new relationship when he was aged about 8 or 9, from which three younger half siblings resulted. He had enjoyed going to work with his stepfather, who worked in the excavation industry, but this relationship broke up when he was in his late teens. The applicant had since fallen out with his mother over his re-imprisonment and other issues. He had no contact with his brother and sisters.

16In 1999 the applicant was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and conduct disorder and was placed on medication. He was referred to the St Vincent's adolescent care program, a residential program for young males with serious behavioural difficulties. He resided there for approximately 12 months prior to his arrest on earlier matters. He responded to that highly structured program and successfully completed year 10. He had employment in the past as a roof tiler for 12 months, which he enjoyed, as a labourer and an electrician's assistant. He had no post-high school education or trade qualifications.

17At the age of 18 he was imprisoned in June 2005 for an offence of robbery in company while armed with a dangerous weapon, for which he received a total term of 7 years, 6 months. He was released in June 2010 after serving his non-parole period of 5 years. He had spent all but 10 months of his adult life in custody. He lived with his mother after she collected him from jail, but after a few days she left him and moved away to northern New South Wales. His primary supporter since then was his maternal uncle, who gave evidence.

18The applicant was exposed to a criminal subculture when growing up and had been desensitised to crime, given his involvement from age 15. In the past he had found it easier to cope in custody without emotional ties and had discouraged any visits. He considered his fellow inmates as his family.

19In September 2010, while at liberty, he formed a relationship with his partner, the sister of an old friend. She is three years older than him and has a daughter, then aged 7. He had known her for over 10 years and they had been living together. He had formed a strong emotional attachment to her and her daughter, which he believed to be reciprocal. He reported that she was a stable person with a healthy lifestyle. In hindsight he was very self-critical for his failure to recognise and respond appropriately to the relationship she had offered him. The letter she wrote was strongly supportive of the applicant, but he was uncertain of his future relationship with her, believing that it would depend on the length of his sentence.

20Her Honour noted that the applicant told the psychologist, Ms Robilliard, that in committing the offences he was helping out mates, one of whom he had known since childhood. The psychologist noted that the applicant bore the hallmarks of institutionalisation, describing a set of maladaptive behaviours invoked by the pressures of living in an institutional setting. 

21Her Honour observed that the applicant had spent critical years in custody, when most young people in the community were acquiring vocational and other skills, training and experiences which enabled them to become independent and self sufficient. He had minimal family support post-release, except for the relationship he was developing with his uncle and his family prior to his arrest. The psychologist noted that the most positive, yet confusing experience of his period in the community was the formation of his relationship. His primary motivation for changing his behaviour was the possibility of preserving and re-negotiating a relationship with his partner. The psychologist also considered that the applicant showed some signs of reconsidering his current attitudes and values in relation to the offers of professional assistance.

22The psychologist found the applicant to be cognitively intact and of sound average intelligence. He was a tall, athletically built young man of good appearance, who she considered could benefit from vocational training and further education, as well as individual psychotherapy, to isolate causative factors of his criminal lifestyle. Her Honour also noted that the applicant had expressed some doubts as to whether the counsellors and psychologists employed by the Department of Corrective Services were ""really on his side"".

23The applicant had told the psychologist that since his return to remand in January 2011 he had gained some insight into his antisocial thinking, attitudes and behaviour and was distressed and disturbed by his circumstances. The psychologist considered that his attitudes, values and behaviour were indicative of thoroughgoing institutionalisation and an antisocial personality disorder. 

24Her Honour considered that he was at a crossroads situation. She referred to Mr Wisnewski's pre-sentence report, which observed that the applicant had expressed no remorse for his offending and said that he could steal any car. There were no financial motivations or drug or alcohol issues and the applicant considered that rehabilitation is a personal choice, but did not see the benefit in programs. Mr Wisnewski considered him to have little insight and that the applicant did not equate his actions as being directly linked to a victim. Her Honour observed that that accorded with his evidence at the sentencing hearing, that he did not think of the consequences of his actions, when committing the offences.

25In the pre-sentence report the applicant was described by Mr Wisnewski as arrogant, something which her Honour observed was not noted by the psychologist and an impression that she did not form of him. Her Honour considered that the applicant was not arrogant, but rather someone who had adapted and been forced to adopt protective mechanisms during his long periods of incarceration at an impressionable and vulnerable age.

26The applicant did tell Mr Wisnewski that he would like to change his behaviour for the purpose of his relationship. Her Honour also noted that he told the psychologist that he found it easier to acquire money through illegal means, but that he was making a concerted effort to behave in prison, unlike his behaviour during earlier periods of incarceration. Her Honour considered that his desire to rehabilitate himself and redirect his future had been borne out by corrective service records, which demonstrated that during earlier periods of incarceration he was punished for numerous breaches, for a variety of matters, one of them being a failed urine test. 

27The psychologist assessed the applicant to be at high to moderate risk of re-offending. Her Honour noted the applicant's evidence that his attitude to offending had completely changed because of his relationship; that he did not like custody; that he was now standoffish with other prisoners, trying to work and play sport to keep himself occupied, as well as working at the metal shop and developing a number of skills. The applicant also said he now liked working and that he would participate in programs, if asked.

28Her Honour also noted his explanation for the failed urine test to be an inability to produce urine in front of other prisoners and efforts to address that issue via letters sent to the Attorney General. There was no suggestion that the applicant is a drug user or that this failure had anything to do with illicit drug taking.

29Her Honour noted the close relationship developed with his uncle after his release from custody in 2010 and the support and accommodation which his uncle offered him on release. Her Honour found the applicant's uncle to be an impressive witness, whose evidence she accepted as truthful and objective. He described the applicant's mother as having a number of significant problems and attracting a lowlife crowd to her house, which he described as always being a place of conflict, whether it be over drugs, money or relationship issues and not the best place for a young mind to be nurtured. She noted the good relationship which the applicant had developed with his uncle, who considered that he had matured quite a lot and was becoming more family oriented, as a result of his relationship. His uncle also gave evidence that the applicant had expressed remorse to him and had been in tears as to how his offences had affected others, not just himself. 

30His uncle had encouraged the applicant to be positive in custody and to plan for his future. He had offered him work and accommodation on release and hoped that he would become involved with his football club, where he would have an opportunity to meet and interact with a different group of associates and friends.

31Her Honour also noted the applicant's acknowledgement that his offences were very serious, but that he did not think they were serious at the time he had committed them, not then thinking of the consequences. She concluded that there was a marked difference in the applicant's behaviour; that he had expressed remorse; and had prospects of rehabilitation, although that conclusion had to be approached cautiously, given the psychologist's opinion. Nevertheless, her Honour accepted that the applicant intended to redirect his life and not to re-offend, but considered that rehabilitation would require the applicant receiving considerable assistance in custody, as well as in the community.

32Her Honour also considered the question of parity, referring to Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540. After referring to the Crown's case that parity with the co-offender Oatley was relevant to the sentence for counts 2 and 3, but with reservations, given the different charges and maximum penalties involved; the lesser discount which the applicant ought to receive for his plea; and the offenders' different subjective circumstances, her Honour concluded:

""Although, of course, it is not impossible that strict parity may arise with co-offenders charged with different offences, I do not think Jimmy is authority for the proposition that it must follow, as seems clear from [203] of Campbell JA's judgment. What is sought to be achieved in parity, or proportionality principles, is justice before the law.""


33Her Honour accepted that the question of rehabilitation had to be approached with caution, but that there had been remorse expressed; insight gained; a measure of maturity achieved in custody; relationships developed with his uncle and partner and their families; and a demonstrated change in attitude. Oatley, her Honour observed, had only very recently demonstrated any change in attitude.

34Her Honour also noted that both Oatley and the applicant had breached their parole by the commission of the subject offences. The balance of parole which was revoked for Oakley was a period of 8 months and 14 days and for the applicant, a period of 2 years, 3 months and 15 days. She also considered a significant difference between Oatley and the applicant to be that Oatley was convicted at Port Macquarie Local Court on 15 April 2012 of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company. This offence was committed in custody and he received a sentence of 12 months for that matter, with no parole period. 

35Oatley was sentenced on 24 April 2012 for two offences: count 1 - possession of an offensive weapon whilst in company with intent to commit an armed robbery, which had a maximum penalty of 15 years, with no standard non-parole period. A charge of larceny of a motor vehicle was taken into account on a Form 1, the same matter to be taken into account on count 2 in the applicant's case. Count 2 in Oatley's case was possession of a Glock pistol without authorisation by licence or permit, the same charge as the applicant's count 3. Oatley pleaded guilty four months before the trial and was given a discount of approximately 15% for his plea.

36Her Honour noted that Oatley was approximately two years younger than the applicant, but that he had a somewhat more extensive criminal history and that in his case the sentencing judge was satisfied that there was a pattern of disobedience to the law involving offences of violence and dishonesty, that had commenced shortly after he turned 17. She considered that the applicant had more serious offences on his record, the most serious of which was robbery in company while armed with a dangerous weapon. She noted however that in Oatley's case a pattern of violence had continued even while in custody. 

37She also noted that in Oatley's case, as to totality and the balance of parole, the sentencing judge concluded it to be appropriate to accumulate the sentences for the subject offences by 12 months. In the result Oatley was sentenced to:

Count 1 - a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months and a total term of 5 years, to commence on 28 January 2012, one year after he was arrested for the offence and taken into custody.

Count 2 - a non-parole period of 33 months in a total term of 51 months to commence from the same date, 28 January 2012.


38As to the co-offender in relation to count 1, Justin Bourke, her Honour noted that he had been charged with two offences - robbery being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a firearm, contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act and possession of an unregistered firearm, and a pistol, contrary to s 36(1) Firearms Act, which has a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. In addition, Bourke admitted his guilt in respect of four further offences, namely three offences of break, enter and steal contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act and one offence of cultivate prohibited plant contrary to s 23(1)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Those offences were committed in breach of a s 9 bond.

39Bourke's criminal history was described by the sentencing judge as 'not a significant record', which included possession of prohibited drugs, larceny, enter vehicle without consent of the owner, break, enter and steal, assault and robbery in company. Her Honour noted that Bourke had a long history of substance abuse, adjustment disorder and ADHD. He had good continuing support in the community including that of his sister, mother, stepfather and fiancée. It was concluded that he had reasonable prospects of rehabilitation.

40Bourke received a 25% discount for his plea, entered at the earliest opportunity. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months to date from 11 May 2011, with a total term of 5 years and 3 months on count 1, taking into account the 4 offences of a Form 1. The starting point before discount was therefore 7 years.

41Her Honour noted the applicant's case that this offence fell within the lower category of offences of this kind, because the applicant was not involved in the actual planning; that his role was minor and not integral to the commission of the offence; that he provided the vehicle to use in the robbery; that while the situation was threatening, no actual violence was used; and that there were no bullets in a gun used by Bourke and no evidence of ammunition in the other weapon.

42Her Honour noted the Crown's concession that the applicant had a relatively minor role in this offence, although it submitted that his subjective features, including his more extensive criminal history and his breach of parole, pointed in the opposite direction. The Crown also relied on his prospects of rehabilitation. Its case was that given that Bourke was also being sentenced taking into account other significant offences, albeit they were old and given the applicant's relatively minor role, the sentence should be somewhat less than that of Bourke, despite the differences in their subjective features.

43Her Honour noted as to counts 2 and 3 that alcohol or drugs affected neither Oatley nor the applicant at the time of other offences. Her Honour considered that although the conspiracy offence may have been partly committed to help a mate, on the applicant's own admissions to the psychologist, it was also committed out of greed. The planned robbery could not be carried out because of the intervention of police. Her Honour accepted that the fact that no armed robbery actually occurred, no money was taken and no one was threatened or injured had some impact on reducing the level of the applicant's criminality, but she considered that impact to be quite minimal.

44The Crown conceded that because Oatley had received concurrent sentences, in the applicant's case the sentences for counts 2 and 3 should also be concurrent. As to count 1 her Honour accepted that some accumulation was necessary, given that there was considerable potential danger, given the rounds in the Glock pistol. As to count 3 she accepted that the applicant's criminality was somewhat less than that of Oatley, who owned the firearms and brought them from his home.

45Her Honour considered that the sentences had to reflect both personal and general deterrence, but because of the applicant's immaturity, somewhat greater weight had to be given to rehabilitation, as had been the case with Oatley. As to totality, the breach of parole was accepted to be an aggravating feature. The sentence was backdated 6 months after the date of arrest to reflect what was said in Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58; (2006) 160 A Crim R 145.

46Special circumstances were found given the accumulation of sentences, the risk of institutionalisation and the need for greater than usual supervision and assistance on release to the community.

Parity

47Both grounds of appeal finally pressed raised parity arguments. In my view neither ground was made out. 

48The reason for the abandonment of the complaint that the penalty imposed was manifestly excessive, was well explained by the overall sentence imposed on the applicant and the date that sentence commenced - 6 months after his arrest. The evidence established that both general and specific deterrence had to feature in the sentences imposed. Given the nature of his offences and that they were committed while the applicant was on parole for another serious offence, a head sentence of 6 years and a non-parole period of 4, (not the 7 years and 4 and a half years advanced in the applicant's written submissions), was not a heavy sentence for these offences. 

49A complaint as to parity accepts that the sentence imposed was otherwise appropriate (see England v R; Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [22]; Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [251]). It is for the applicant to demonstrate that the sentence imposed on him has left him with a justifiable sense of grievance. 

50In Green v R; Quinn v R [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 it was explained at [31]:

""Because appeals are creatures of statute, the parity principle in appeals against sentence arises in a statutory context. The jurisdictions to entertain such appeals, conferred by statutes on courts of criminal appeal in Australia, are supported by powers to increase or reduce sentences affected by appealable error. In the exercise of those powers in appeals by convicted persons, and subject to the applicable sentencing statutes, a court may ""reduce a sentence not in itself manifestly excessive in order to avoid a marked disparity with a sentence imposed on a co-offender.""[Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609-610 per Gibbs CJ] The exercise of the statutory discretion is informed by the common law norm. Gibbs CJ said in Lowe v The Queen [(1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610]: 

""the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers that the disparity is such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done."" 

The sense of grievance necessary to attract appellate intervention with respect to disparate sentences is to be assessed by objective criteria. The application of the parity principle does not involve a judgment about the feelings of the person complaining of disparity [Postiglione v R (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 323 per Gummow J, 338 per Kirby J]. The court will refuse to intervene where disparity is justified by differences between co-offenders such as age, background, criminal history, general character and the part each has played in the relevant criminal conduct or enterprise [Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 per Gibbs CJ].""


51As discussed in Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at [65]:

""Equal justice requires identity of outcome in cases that are relevantly identical. It requires different outcomes in cases that are different in some relevant respect [original emphasis]."" 


52In this case, the applicant has not established an objective basis for his sense of grievance with the sentences imposed upon him. There is no 'marked disparity' in those sentences and the differences in the charges to which the respective pleas were entered, as well his circumstances, when compared to those of his co-offenders, all provide a proper basis for the differences in the sentences respectively imposed upon them.

Discounts

53The applicant and one of his co-offenders received different discounts for their pleas, reflective of the time and circumstances in which the pleas were entered and the utilitarian savings which resulted. It is well settled that the earlier a plea is entered, the greater the discount, given the utilitarian savings which flow. The principles by which a discount is to be determined were discussed in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; (2009) 195 A Crim R 1 at [32]:

""1. The discount for the utilitarian value of the pleas will be determined largely by the timing of the plea so that the earlier the plea the greater discount: Thomson at [154]; Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377 at [116].

2. Some allowance may be made in determining the discount where the trial would be particularly complicated or lengthy: Thomson at [154]. 

3. The utilitarian discount does not reflect any other consideration arising from the plea, such as saving witnesses from giving evidence but this is relevant to remorse: Thomson at [119] to [123]; nor is it affected by post-offending conduct: Perry [2006] NSWCCA 351.

4. The utilitarian discount does not take into account the strength of the prosecution case: Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225. 

5. There is to be no component in the discount for remorse nor is there to be a separate quantified discount for remorse: MAK and MSK [2006] NSWCCA 381; Kite [2009] NSWCCA 12 or for the ""Ellis discount""; Lewins [2007] NSWCCA 189; S [2008] NSWCCA 186.

6. Where there are multiple offences and pleas at different times, the utilitarian value of the plea should be separately considered for each offence: SY [2003] NSWCCA 291. 

7. There may be offences that are so serious that no discount should be given: Thomson at [158]; Kalache [2000] NSWCCA 2; where the protection of the public requires a longer sentence: El-Andouri [2004] NSWCCA 178. 

8. Generally the reason for the delay in the plea is irrelevant because, if it is not forthcoming, the utilitarian value is reduced: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Giac [2008] NSWCCA 280. 

9. The utilitarian value of a delayed plea is less and consequently the discount is reduced even where there has been a plea bargain: Dib [2003] NSWCCA 117; Ahmad [2006] NSWCCA 177; or where the offender is waiting to see what charges are ultimately brought by the Crown: Sullivan and Skillin [2008] NSWCCA 296; or the offender has delayed the plea to obtain some forensic advantage: Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; Saad [2007] NSWCCA 98, such as having matters put on a Form 1: Chiekh and Hoete [2004] NSWCCA 448. 
10. An offer of a plea that is rejected by the Crown but is consistent with a jury verdict after trial can result in a discount even though there is no utilitarian value: Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 310; Johnson [2003] NSWCCA 129 

11. The discount can result in a different type of sentence but the resulting sentence should not again be reduced by reason of the discount: Lo [2003] NSWCCA 313. 

12. The amount of the discount does not depend upon the administrative arrangements or any practice in a particular court or by a particular judge for the management of trials or otherwise.""


54Contrary to the case advanced for the applicant, here there was no error established in the discounts he received for either count 1 or counts 2 and 3. His pleas were not entered until after legal argument at the commencement of the trial, which led to an amendment which resulted in him being charged as an accessory before the fact, the entry of his plea to that offence and a 20% discount. That properly reflected the utilitarian saving flowing from entry of that plea and also had proper regard to the circumstances in which the charge was laid and the plea entered. 

55The applicant was not entitled in those circumstances to a discount of 25%, as was argued for the applicant.

56There was no suggestion that beforehand, the applicant had indicated any preparedness to enter a plea to such a lesser charge, or indeed any charge. He always knew the nature of his criminality. Had he offered earlier to enter a plea he would have been entitled to a greater discount than those which he received. 

57It follows that there was also plainly no error in the 15% discount which he received for his other two offences, having regard to the time and circumstances in which those pleas were entered and the utilitarian savings which resulted. Nothing prevented these pleas having been entered earlier. 

Ground 1 - parity with the offender Bourke

58The applicant's case was pressed on the basis that one of the most important considerations was that the applicant and Bourke had been charged with different offences, reflecting that the applicant's involvement had been confined to providing Bourke with a stolen vehicle used in the robbery. That reflected the Crown's concession that his role had been relatively minor. In the result he was entitled to greater leniency than he was afforded.

59The starting point for his co-offender's sentence for armed robbery with a dangerous weapon was 7 years. Bourke also had four other offences taken into account in that sentencing exercise, three of break, enter and steal and one of cultivate cannabis. After a discount of 25% he received a head sentence of 5 years, 3 months, having entered his plea in the Local Court. 

60Bourke's offence was plainly serious, given the use of a weapon to threaten staff, the use of a stolen car and the theft of some $81,000, $30,000 of which he received, which had not been recovered. Here the sentence also had to be increased to take account of the other offences dealt with on the Form 1, as discussed in Attorney General's Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146, where Spigelman CJ observed at [42]: 

""The position, in my opinion, is that, although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt has been admitted, with a view to increasing the penalty that would otherwise be appropriate for the particular offence. The Court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community's entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which there are offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. There are matters which limit the extent to which this is so. The express provision in s33(3) referring to the maximum penalty for the primary offence is one. The principle of totality is another.""


61Bourke was then on a good behaviour bond and had a significant criminal history. The sentence imposed upon him also reflected his subjective circumstances, which were different to those of the applicant, given his history of depression, anxiety and significant drug abuse, as well as a diagnosed adjustment disorder, found to have resulted in seriously impaired judgment a the time of this offence, committed in order to pay his drug debts. Strong feelings of remorse had been demonstrated, steps taken to cease drug use and reasonable prospects of rehabilitation were found.

62The applicant received a lesser sentence for his offence, reflective of his lesser role. It also had regard, however, to the maximum penalty applying to his offence, 25 years, the same as that applying to Bourke, and his plea. He was thus sentenced to a total term of 4 years, after a 20% discount.

63In written submissions the applicant's case was that his sentence was so severe, that it arguably represented a penalty that should have been associated with a participant at the scene of the robbery, such as a driver or lookout. In the result the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. That was finally not pressed, given the amended grounds of appeal relied on, which were confined to a parity argument, which, as I have explained, proceeds on the basis of an acceptance that the sentence imposed was otherwise appropriate. Given the nature and seriousness of this offence and the maximum penalty of 25 years, that concession plainly had a proper basis. That the applicant was entitled to greater leniency than he was afforded by her Honour, is not apparent on the evidence.

64The applicant's offence was serious, albeit not as serious as that of Bourke. He was then on parole for a robbery in company, committed in 2006 while he was armed with a dangerous weapon. That was a matter of aggravation (see s 21A(2)(j) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [15]). He also had a more serious, violent criminal record than his co-offender. His subjective circumstances were also very different to those of Bourke, having no financial motivation to explain his offending, nor any drug or alcohol issues. While her Honour had proper regard to his circumstances and the problems resulting from his institutionalisation and family background, and accepted that he had shown genuine remorse, she had to conclude that his prospects of rehabilitation were not so clear and had to take into account that he was found to have a high to moderate risk of future offending.

65The applicant's sentence was some 15 months less than that imposed on Bourke. In the circumstances, that was not a marked disparity. In part it reflected a proper difference in the discount which the two offenders received. Otherwise it reflected the proper account which her Honour took of the question of parity, as her judgment revealed, given the distinguishing features of the offences and the offenders, which had to be taken into account in applying that principle. The differences in the outcome in the two sentencing exercises properly reflected the differences to which her Honour pointed. The resulting disparity is justified by the discount and the differences between these co-offenders, given their background, criminal history, general character and the part each played in the criminal conduct which led to the respective charges to which they entered their pleas.

66In the result this ground of appeal must be dismissed.

Ground 2 - parity with the co-offender Oatley

67The applicant's case was that despite the different offences with which the co-offenders had been charged and the differences in the applicable penalties, it was unfair and artificial to characterise Oatley's charge and his offence as less serious than that of the applicant. Her Honour had found that they were equal conspirators and that had not been reflected in the sentences imposed on the applicant, with the result that the parity principle had been offended. There was no basis upon which he ought justly to have received a higher penalty than Oatley. It was Oatley who should have received a heavier penalty.

68In this case it may not be overlooked that the applicant and his co-offenders were not charged with the same offences. In Jimmy v R [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540, Campbell JA explained at [203]:

""There are significant limitations, however, on reducing a sentence on the basis of that of a co-offender who has committed a different crime. At least some of the limits on the use of the parity principle in such a case are: 

1. It cannot overcome those differences in sentence that arise from a prosecutorial decision about whether to charge a person at all, or with what crime to charge them: R v Howard; Wurramarbra; R v Formosa

2. If it is used to compare the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes, there can be significant practical difficulties. Those practical difficulties become greater the greater the difference between the crimes charged becomes, and can become so great that in the circumstances of a particular case a judge cannot apply it, or cannot see that there is any justifiable sense of grievance arising from the discrepancy: R v Gibson; R v Howard; R v Formosa

3. It cannot overcome differences in sentence that arise from one of the co-offenders having been given a sentence that is unjustifiably low: R v Armstrong; R v Diamond; R v Rexhaj; R v Isamundar

4. There are particular difficulties in an applicant succeeding in a disparity argument where the disparity is said to arise by comparison with the sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the applicant: Krakouer; Pham; Woodgate. See also R v Stanbouli [2003] NSWCCA 355; 141 A Crim R 531 at [127]-[134]. However R v Nguyen stands as one example where that result arose."" 


69This was such a case. 

70Oatley was charged with an offence under s 33B(2) of the Crimes Act of possess offensive weapon whilst in company with intent to commit armed robbery, which had a maximum penalty of 15 years and a possess firearm offence. The applicant was also charged with a firearms offence, but also with a more serious offence of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. It had no maximum penalty, but it was accepted for the accused that the maximum penalty imposed for the statutory offence under s 97 of the Crimes Act of 25 years, was relevant to be taken into account. There were several associated Form 1 matters also taken into account in both cases.

71It follows that in the sentencing exercise, the fact that the applicant was charged with a more serious offence than Oatley had to be taken into account in the sentencing exercise, as did her Honour's view of the evidence led in the applicant's case and what that showed as to the respective circumstances of the two offenders.

72The starting point for the applicant's sentence was 6 years and 6 months, while that of Oatley was 5 years and 10 months. They both received a 15% discount, with the result a head sentence in Oatley's case of only 5 years and in the applicant's case, 5 years and 6 months. In her sentencing remarks her Honour also explained that she had taken the starting point of the sentence into account in considering the question of parity, explaining:

""You have been given a discount on the balance of parole that you are to serve, by which I was attempting to achieve a less crushing sentence.""

73This was a reference to the start date of the applicant's sentence, which was backdated to 6 months after his arrest and revocation of his parole, he having on arrest still over 2 years, 3 months till his sentence expired, while Bourke, who was also on parole on arrest had only some 8 months still to serve. The sentences for counts 2 and 3 were accumulated by only 6 months. On the evidence, that was a favourable approach to the accumulation of the sentence for his further serious offending.

74Her Honour's judgment reveals the care which she took in considering the difficult question of parity as between these co-offenders. She reached the conclusion that the applicant must have a heavier sentence than that imposed on Oatley. There was in the result certainly a disparity between them, but that it was a marked disparity which objectively left the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance, was not shown.

75Her Honour found that the applicant's involvement in the conspiracy was equivalent to that of Oatley and that he had been motivated by misplaced loyalty to Oatley. It was also relevant that while the co-offenders had acted together in obtaining items needed for the armed robbery, it was the applicant who had funded their purchase, Oatley having no funds. It was also the applicant who broke into the car and stole it, in Oatley's presence, having promised to do so when Oatley got out of prison. They had what had been so procured in their joint possession, as well as the firearms which belonged to Oatley, when they were arrested. . 

76Her Honour did not accept the applicant's evidence that he had not intended to participate in the robbery which the arrest precluded. That conclusion was relevant to this sentencing exercise, as was the fact that at the time of this offence both offenders were on parole, the applicant in respect of the 2006 armed robbery. As discussed in Chaplin v R [2006] NSWCCA 40; (2006) 160 A Crim R 85 at [27], given that this was a similar offence, that was even a more severe aggravation than in respect of the offence the subject of count 1. 

77There were again also relevant differences in the offenders' subjective circumstances. Oatley had been the victim of physical abuse by his parents and had suffered substance abuse problems since age 13. He, too, had a violent criminal record, including an offence in custody in 2012 of recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company. He had been on parole for 17 days before the commission of this offence, his motivation being greed. There was pessimism about his risk of reoffending, despite signs of a desire to address his addiction.

78In the result in my view it cannot be concluded that there is a marked disparity in these sentences, not properly justified by differences between the co-offenders' backgrounds, criminal history, general character, the part each played in this criminal conduct and the offences to which they each entered their pleas.

79It follows that this ground of appeal must also be dismissed.

2705875,"BUCKMAN, Kerry Ann v R [2013] NSWCCA 258","Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Ms Kerry Ann Buckman (the appellant) has been charged with the offence of supply of a prohibited drug, namely Dexamphetamine, contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (Drug Act). The appellant was alleged to have been in possession of 10 grams of the substance. The appellant was charged with supply in reliance on the deeming provisions in s 29 of the Drug Act.

2The appellant contended that the provision under which she was charged was inconsistent with Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Criminal Code) which relates to serious drug offences and thus were invalid. The trial judge, Freeman DCJ, heard argument on this issue before empanelling a jury. He rejected the argument but granted a certificate under s 5F(3)(b) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 permitting the appellant to appeal to this Court.

3The appeal was heard at the same time as an appeal brought under s 5F(3)(b) by Ms Lillian Ratcliff. That appeal raised issues which were identical to those which were raised in this appeal. Further, each appellant adopted the other's respective written and oral submissions. It is thus necessary to deal with both sets of submissions in this appeal.

The legislative background

4Prior to dealing with the parties' submissions it is convenient to set out the relevant State and Commonwealth legislation.

5Section 25 of the Drug Act created the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. At the time of the alleged offence it was in the following terms:

""25(1) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

(1A) A person of or above the age of 18 years who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug (other than cannabis leaf) to a person under the age of 16 years is guilty of an offence.

(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

(2A) A person of or above the age of 18 years who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug (other than cannabis leaf) which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug to a person under the age of 16 years is guilty of an offence.

(2B) Where, on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (1A) or (2A), the jury are satisfied that the person charged had, at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the person to whom the prohibited drug was supplied was of or above the age of 16 years, they may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2), respectively, and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.

(2C) A person of or above the age of 18 years who procures a person under the age of 16 years to supply, or take part in the supply of, a prohibited drug (other than cannabis leaf) to another person is guilty of an offence.

(2D) A person of or above the age of 18 years who procures a person under the age of 16 years to supply, or take part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug (other than cannabis leaf) which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

(2E) It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence under subsection (2C) or (2D) if the defendant establishes that the defendant had, at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the person who was procured to supply, or take part in the supply of, the prohibited drug was of or above the age of 16 years.

(3) Where, on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (2) or (2D), the jury are not satisfied that the amount of prohibited drug involved is equal to or more than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug, they may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2C), respectively, and the person shall be liable to punishment accordingly.

(4) Nothing in this section renders unlawful the supply of a prohibited drug by: 

(a) a person licensed or authorised to do so under the Poisons Act 1996, or

(b) a person acting in accordance with an authority granted by the Secretary of the Department of Health where the Secretary is satisfied that the supply of the prohibited drug is for the purpose of scientific research, instruction, analysis or study, or

(c) a person acting in accordance with a direction given by the Commissioner of Police under section 39RA,

or renders unlawful the taking part by any other person in the supply of a prohibited drug by a person to whom paragraph (a), (b) or (c) applies.

(5) Nothing in this section renders unlawful the administration of a prohibited drug to a person being cared for by another person in the circumstances described in section 10 (2) (d).""

6Section 29 of the Drug Act sets out circumstances where possession is taken to be possession for supply. It provides as follows:

""29 A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply, unless: 

(a) the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply, or

(b) except where the prohibited drug is prepared opium, cannabis leaf, cannabis oil, cannabis resin, heroin or 6-monoacetylmorphine or any other acetylated derivatives of morphine, the person proves that he or she obtained possession of the prohibited drug on and in accordance with the prescription of a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner, midwife practitioner, dentist or veterinary practitioner.""

7It should be noted that a traffickable quantity for the drug in question is 3 grams.

8""Supply"" is defined in s 3 of the Drug Act as follows:

""supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.""

9Section 4 of the Drug Act deals with admixtures. It provides as follows:

""4 In this Act, a reference to a prohibited drug includes a reference to any preparation, admixture, extract or other substance containing any proportion of the prohibited drug.""

10It was not disputed that the effect of s 4 of the Drug Act was that it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove the precise amount of the particular prohibited drug contained in any substance which is the subject of the charge, including for the purpose of the deeming provision in s 29: R v R2 (1990) 19 NSWLR 513 at 514-515.

11Section 32 of the Drug Act provides that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 25(1) is a fine of 2,000 penalty units or imprisonment for a term of 15 years, or both.

12The offence of possession of a prohibited drug is dealt with in s 10 of the Drug Act. It provides as follows:

""10(1) A person who has a prohibited drug in his or her possession is guilty of an offence.

(2) Nothing in this section renders unlawful the possession of a prohibited drug by:

(a) a person licensed or authorised to have possession of the prohibited drug under the Poisons Act 1966,

(b) a person acting in accordance with an authority granted by the Secretary of the Department of Health where the Secretary is satisfied that the possession of the prohibited drug is for the purpose of scientific research, instruction, analysis or study,

(b1) a person acting in accordance with a direction given by the Commissioner of Police under section 39RA,

(c) a person for or to whom the prohibited drug has been lawfully prescribed or supplied, or

(d) a person who:

(i) has the care of, or is assisting in the care of, another person for or to whom the prohibited drug has been lawfully prescribed or supplied, and

(ii) has the prohibited drug in his or her possession for the sole purpose of administering, or assisting in the self-administration of, the prohibited drug to the other person in accordance with the prescription or supply.""

13Section 9 of the Drug Act provides that prosecutions for offences of possession shall be dealt with summarily in the Local Court. Section 21 provides that the penalty for an offence under the Division that includes s 10 is a fine of 20 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both. 

14The relevant Commonwealth legislation is Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code entitled ""Serious Drug Offence"". At the relevant time, s 300.1 of the Criminal Code set out the purposes of the Part as follows:

""300.1(1) The purpose of this Part is to create offences relating to drug trafficking and to give effect to the United Nations Contravention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, done at Vienna on 20 December 1988.

(2) Subsection (1) does not limit the legislative powers of the Parliament in relation to this Part.""

15Section 300.4 deals with the concurrent operation of State and Territory laws. It provides as follows:

""300.4(1) This Part is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law of a State or Territory.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), this part is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of a law of a State or Territory that makes:

(a) an act or omission that is an offence against a provision of this Part; or

(b) a similar act or omission;

an offence against the law of the State or Territory.

(3) Subsection (2) applies even if the law of the State or Territory does any one or more of the following:

(a) provides for a penalty for the offence that differs from the penalty provided for in this Part;

(b) provides for a fault element in relation to the offence that differs from the fault elements applicable to the offence under this Part;

(c) provides for a defence in relation to the offence that differs from the defences applicable to the offence under this Part.""

16Section 300.2 provides that a trafficable quantity of a controlled drug is a quantity not less than the quantity specified as a trafficable quantity in Division 314, under regulations or in a determination. At the time, the relevant quantities of controlled drugs were set out in s 314.1. Section 314.1(2) stated that a substance is a controlled drug if the substance is a stereoisomer. The affidavit supporting the notice of motion before Freeman DCJ stated that Dexamphetamine is a stereoisomer of Amphetamine. Amphetamine is listed as a controlled drug under s 314.1, the trafficable quantity being 2 grams. 

17Division 302 of Pt 9.1 deals with trafficking in controlled drugs. Section 302.1 defines ""traffics"" as follows:

""302.1(1) For the purposes of this Part, a person traffics in a substance if:

(a) the person sells the substance; or

(b) the person prepares the substance for supply with the intention of selling any of it or believing that another person intends to sell any of it; or

(c) the person transports the substance with the intention of selling any of it or believing that another person intends to sell any of it; or

(d) the person guards or conceals the substance with the intention of selling any of it or assisting another person to sell any of it; or

(e) the person possesses the substance with the intention of selling any of it.

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1)(b), preparing a substance for supply includes packaging the substance or separating the substance into discrete units.""

18The word ""sell"" is defined in s 300.2 to include barter or exchange, or agree to sell. As such, it should be noted that the definition of ""traffics"" does not include gratuitous supply.

19Section 302.4 creates the offence of trafficking controlled drugs. It provides as follows:

""302.4(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person traffics in a substance; and

(b) the substance is a controlled drug.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years or 2,000 penalty units, or both.

(2) The fault element for paragraph (1)(b) is recklessness.""

20Section 302.5 creates a presumption in respect of trafficking where a person has the controlled drug in his or her possession. It provides as follows:

""302.5(1) For the purposes of proving an offence against this Division, if a person has:

(a) prepared a trafficable quantity of a substance for supply; or

(b) transported a trafficable quantity of a substance; or

(c) guarded or concealed a trafficable quantity of a substance; or

(d) possessed a trafficable quantity of a substance;

the person is taken to have had the necessary intention or belief concerning the sale of the substance to have been trafficking in the substance.

(2) Subsection (1) does not apply if the person proves that he or she had neither that intention not belief.""

21Section 308.1 deals with the offence of possessing controlled drugs. It provides as follows:

""308.1(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person possesses a substance; and

(b) the substance is a controlled drug.

Penalty: Imprisonment for 2 years or 400 penalty units, or both.

(2) The fault element for paragraph (1)(b) is recklessness.

(3) If:

(a) a person is charged with, or convicted of, an offence against subsection (1); and

(b) the offence is alleged to have been, or was, committed in a State or Territory;

the person may be tried, punished or otherwise dealt with as if the offence were an offence against the law of the State or Territory that involved the possession or use of a controlled drug (however described).

Note: Subsection (3) allows for drug users to be diverted from the criminal justice system to receive the same education, treatment and support that is available in relation to drug offences under State and Territory laws.

(4) However, a person punished under subsection (3) must not be:

(a) sentenced to a period of imprisonment that exceeds the period set out in subsection (1); or

(b) fined an amount that exceeds the amount set out in subsection (1).

(5) Subsection (3) does not limit:

(a) Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914; or

(b) section 68 or 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903; or

(c) any other law that provides for a law of a State or Territory to apply in relation to the exercise of federal jurisdiction.""

22In considering the issues raised in the appeal the provisions of s 4C of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) are also relevant. This section provides as follows:

""4C(1) Where an act or omission constitutes an offence:

(a) under 2 or more laws of the Commonwealth; or

(b) both under a law of the Commonwealth and at common law;

the offender shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be liable to be prosecuted and punished under either or any of those laws of the Commonwealth or at common law, but shall not be liable to be punished twice for the same act or omission.

(2) Where an act or omission constitutes an offence under both:

(a) a law of the Commonwealth and a law of the State; or

(b) a law of the Commonwealth and a law of a Territory;

and the offender has been punished for that offence under the law of the State or the law of the Territory, as the case may be, the offender shall not be liable to be punished for the offence under the law of the Commonwealth.

(3) Where an act or omission constitutes an offence against a law of a Territory, the validity of that law is not affected merely because the act or omission also constitutes an offence against a law of the Commonwealth.""

23As I indicated, Pt 9.1 was passed to give effect to the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Convention). Article 3 of the Convention so far as is relevant provides as follows:

""1. Each Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences under its domestic law, when committed intentionally:

(a)(i) The production, manufacture, extraction, preparation, offering, offering for sale, distribution, sale, delivery on any terms whatsoever, brokerage, dispatch, dispatch in transit, transport, importation or exportation of any narcotic drug or any psychotropic substance contrary to the provisions of the 1961 Convention, the 1961 Convention as amended or the 1971 Convention.""

24It should be noted that the Convention did not preclude legislating in respect of gratuitous supply.

25The introduction of Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code was preceded by a Report of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee (Committee) dated October 1998. Chapter 6 of the Report dealt with serious drug offences. It should be noted that the Report made it clear that the views expressed did not necessarily represent the views of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.

26The introduction to Ch 6 of the Report contained the following statement:

""The central theme of this chapter is that the serious offences should focus on individuals who make a business out of drug trafficking. The report proposes three levels of liability, according to whether the offender traffics a large commercial quantity, a commercial quantity or in any quantity at all. Whilst quantitative measures of liability and presumptions of guilt bases on possession of trafficable quantities are common to many jurisdictions, they are remarkable for their absence of any semblance or uniformity. The Committee proposes a more unified approach. It is a primary object of the report to stimulate debate on the appropriateness of existing quantitative measures of liability. This issue has been largely ignored in previous reviews, yet it is a major determinant of an offenders level of criminality and subsequent punishment. The report investigates the rationale for the existing table of drug quantities and seeks to develop a more appropriate model suitable for all State, Territories and the Commonwealth.""

27The Report emphasised the desirability of uniform State and Territory legislation on this issue:

""There is a defensible case for a considerable degree of variation among States in some aspects of health and regulatory legislation. It is obvious, however, that uniformity is essential in those elements of health and regulatory legislation which deal with matters of interstate or international concern. The controls over wholesale and retail distribution and the essential vocabulary of control - the schedules, standards and nomenclature of drug law - all fall within the realm where the need for uniformity is undeniable. The same considerations mandate uniformity in legislation directed against the illicit commercial traffic in psychoactive drugs.

The illicit drug distribution system operates Australia wide and internationally. Australia has undertaken international obligations requiring severe criminal measures against individuals who play a significant commercial role in the organised traffic in drugs. Though there is room for variation in legislative measures directed to the control of use and minimisation of harm to users, the arguments for uniformity in measures directed against commercial exploitation in the illicit market are clear and compelling.""

28The Report stated that as the object of the offences proposed by the Chapter was to strike out illicit traders rather than users, gratuitous transfers were excluded. The Committee made the following comments:

""... In this respect the draft is different from legislation in most Australian jurisdictions, which prohibit sale or supply. The draft follows instead the Victorian Drugs Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981, which excludes gratuitous transfers from the scope of trafficking. For the same reason, Chapter 6 does not include gratuitous administration of controlled drugs to another in the trafficking offence.

Though the general principle is clear, there is an obvious need for exceptions when particular circumstances make gratuitous transfers equivalent in the scale of wrongdoing to trafficking. Gifts or administration of controlled drugs to children are singled out as especially serious offences in some jurisdictions. Chapter 6 accordingly makes supply to a child an offence equivalent to trafficking in some circumstances. Offences involving children are distinguished from trafficking however. Corruption of the young belongs to a different order of wrongdoing from illicit trading and the offences involving supply to minors are the subject of a separate set of provisions in the Code. Whilst they are extremely serious, discretion and humanity are essential in their administration. A significant proportion of those who supply minors will be friends and associates of similar age, who are not engaged in commercial trafficking.""(Citation omitted)

29The Report highlighted the difficulty with the concept of supply in the following terms:

""The complexity of the law on the meaning of supply is a cogent reason for avoiding reliance on the concept if an alternative can be found. There is an additional consideration. Since 'supply' does not include the return or delivery of drugs to their owner, a prohibition against supply is likely to obscure the obvious possibility that the individual who returned the drugs is guilty as an accomplice who provided storage or other facilities: see Carey (1990) 50 A Crim R 163 at 168-169.

It is unnecessary to include prohibitions against supply in trafficking legislation. There are two sets of circumstances in which a prohibition against supply might be thought to have a role in a scheme of prohibitions aimed at commercial trafficking or other major drug crime. The first of these involves commercially motivated gifts to minors. These are the subject of specific prohibition in section 6.4.4 - Supply of drugs to a child. The second area of possible application arises when a person provides storage facilities, transport or other services which involve a transfer of possession of controlled drugs to that person without sale. Such cases are covered, however, by the general provisions on accomplices in Division 11 of Chapter 2 of the Model Criminal Code or in specific prohibitions in this Chapter.""

30Notwithstanding the statement by the Committee of the desirability of uniform legislation, the Explanatory Memorandum accompanying the introduction of the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2005 stated that State legislation would continue to operate alongside the Commonwealth legislation:

""... Existing State and Territory regulatory schemes will continue to operate, and it will be a defence to the offences in the Bill if the relevant conduct is justified or excused under a law of the Commonwealth or a State or Territory.

Overlapping State and Territory drug offences will also continue to operate alongside the offences in Part 9.1 of the Criminal Code. This approach is consistent with the approach taken in other areas of criminal law, such as terrorism, fraud, computer crime, money laundering and sexual servitude. It is intended that drug offences will continue to be investigated in accordance with the established division of responsibility between federal and State and Territory law enforcement agencies. The Bill preserves the existing powers of law enforcement officers, including Customs officials and the Australian Federal Police, in relation to serious drugs offences.""

31However, the Explanatory Memorandum did emphasise that it was intended that gratuitous transfers be excluded. In explaining the effect of s 302.1 the Explanatory Memorandum stated:

""Where trafficking is by possession, the person themselves must be shown to have the intention to sell: the more restrictive fault element in this kind of trafficking reflects the more passible and preliminary nature of the conduct of the accused who merely possesses a controlled drug.""

32This was again emphasised in dealing with the manner in which the presumption contained in s 302.5 could be rebutted:

""If the prosecution shows that there is a trafficable quantity of controlled drug involved in the offence and engages the trafficable quantity presumption, proposed subsection 302.5(2) makes available to the defendant a defence of absence of commercial purposes. If the defendant can prove on the balance of probabilities that he or she did not have both the relevant intention and belief, the defendant would then only be guilty of a base possession offence under proposed section 308.1, rather than any of the commercially motivated trafficking offences in proposed Division 302.""

33The Second Reading Speech also stated that it was intended that the legislation would operate alongside State and Territory legislation, although the Attorney-General emphasised the desirability for uniform legislation in this area. The relevant remarks were as follow:

""Our existing offences are mainly focused on preventing illicit drugs from crossing Australia's border. The new offences will also apply to drug dealings within Australia.

To that extent, they will operate alongside state and territory offences to give more flexibility to law enforcement agencies. This approach will ensure there are no gaps between federal and state laws that can be exploited by drug cartels.

...

One of the main objectives of this bill is to increase the uniformity of drug laws throughout Australia by implementing model drug offences. The next important step will be to achieve nationally consistent lists of drugs that the model offences can apply, and the quantities that trigger the different penalty tiers under the model offences.""

(a) The appellant's submissions

34The appellant emphasised there were three principal relevant differences between the Drug Act and Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code. First, in contrast to the provisions of the Drug Act, supply other than by sale is not an offence under the Criminal Code. Second, the maximum penalty for supply under the Drug Act is 15 years' imprisonment whilst for trafficking in contravention of the Criminal Code the maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment. Third, the quantity of the drug for the purpose of the Criminal Code is the amount of the pure drug. For the purpose of the Drug Act it is the amount of the admixture as defined by s 4 of that Act.

35The appellant also pointed to the fact that in New South Wales it was open to the appellant to be convicted by a majority verdict. She submitted it was not open for that to occur in relation to a prosecution under the Criminal Code. 

36The appellant submitted that the position in the present case is analogous to that considered by the High Court in Dickson v The Queen [2010] HCA 30; (2010) 241 CLR 491 (Dickson). She submitted that as in Dickson the two Acts in issue are directed at controlling the same activities, drug possession and supply. She submitted that the provisions of the Drug Act, in particular the extended definition of supply, render unlawful many acts not covered by the Criminal Code. She submitted that these were the circumstances which formed the basis for the conclusion of the High Court in Dickson. The appellant also pointed to the admixture provision, stating that it was inconsistent with the Criminal Code.

37The appellant also relied on the fact of differing modes of trial, in particular majority verdicts and differences in penalties, whilst noting that those matters had been rejected as indices of inconsistency in Momcilovic v The Queen [2011] HCA 34; (2011) 245 CLR 1 (Momcilovic) by Crennan and Kiefel JJ in their joint judgment and by Heydon J.

38The appellant submitted that s 300.4 of the Criminal Code has no effect because it could only operate in the case of indirect inconsistency, referring to what was said by Mason J in R v Credit Tribunal; Ex parte General Motors Acceptance Corporation, Australia [1977] HCA 34; (1977) 137 CLR 545 at 563-564.

39The appellant, however, also sought to rely on indirect inconsistency. She submitted that it could arise irrespective of provisions such as s 300.4 of the Criminal Code where as a matter of construction of the Commonwealth legislation it could be shown that there was an intention to cover the field. It was submitted that this intention was shown in the present case.

40The appellant acknowledged that the effect of s 109 of the Constitution is to invalidate State legislation only to the extent of inconsistency. However, she submitted that in extending to conduct which falls outside s 302.4 of the Criminal Code, the Drug Act alters, impairs or detracts from the operation of the federal legislation and so ""directly collides with it"". It was submitted that in those circumstances s 25 of the Drug Act was wholly inconsistent with s 302.4 of the Criminal Code and thus was wholly invalid.

41The appellant submitted that the decision of this Court in R v El Helou [2010] NSWCCA 111; (2010) 267 ALR 734, was inconsistent with what was said in Dickson and should not be followed. She also submitted that El Helou only dealt with inconsistency in penalties rather than the substantive differences upon which she relied.

42Finally on this issue the appellant submitted that El Helou was referred to in Dickson as being incorrectly decided. She also submitted that R v Stevens (1991) 23 NSWLR 75 was concerned with different legislation (the Customs Act 1901 (Cth)) and was irrelevant to the present case.

43The appellant also submitted that the decision in Momcilovic was not inconsistent with her submissions. She submitted that the judgment of Gummow J on this issue, with which French CJ and Bell J agreed, was based on the provisions of the Drugs, Poisons and Controlled Substances Act 1981 (Vic) not being as stringent as those in the Criminal Code. She submitted that in the present case the position was to the contrary.

44The appellant also submitted that her arguments were not affected by the comments of Heydon J to the effect that it is the substantive criminal law which determines what area of liberty are left and not procedural law. She submitted this was because reliance in the present case was placed on differences in substantive law, in particular the differences in the definition of trafficking in the Criminal Code, supply in the Drug Act and on the admixture rule contained in s 4 of the Drug Act. She also submitted that her argument was not affected by the conclusion of Crennan and Kiefel JJ that differences in penalty and mode of trial do not result in inconsistency.

45In submissions filed in reply the appellant accepted that the intention of federal Parliament is disclosed by the conventional process of statutory construction, although an expression of intention by the Commonwealth not to cover the field does not of itself avoid any direct inconsistency. She submitted that what was to be divined through a process of construction was whether s 25 of the Drug Act alters, impairs or detracts from the operation of s 302.4 of the Criminal Code, notwithstanding the expression of intention in s 300.4.

46The appellant submitted that the proper construction of s 302.4 should take account of context in the traditional sense including legislative history, the context of the provision in the statutory scheme, its language and its scope and purpose. She submitted that the provision was introduced for two purposes, first, to implement model drug offences which had been developed in conjunction with the State and Territories as part of a model code and, second, to give effect to the Convention.

47The appellant referred to the Second Reading Speech in which the Attorney-General said the introduction of the Bill was to honour the commitment by leaders of all Australian jurisdictions to implement model drug offences and to increase the uniformity of drug laws throughout Australia by implementing such model offences. She referred also to those portions of the Report of the Committee to which I have referred above. She submitted that this material indicated a deliberate intent to exclude gratuitous supply and have it dealt with as possession, deliberately assigning that conduct to a less serious area of criminality.

48At the hearing senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the Commonwealth Parliament deliberately excluded gratuitous supply from the offence of trafficking and thus left open an area of liberty which could not be closed by the State legislation. She submitted that there was a deliberate choice to limit the offence to commercial trafficking, something which was undermined by the Drug Act.

(b) The submissions of Ms Ratcliff

49Ms Ratcliff submitted that s 25(1) encompassed a range of conduct not captured by the operation of s 302.4 and was therefore invalid in the same manner as invalidity arose in Dickson. As with the appellant, Ms Ratcliff emphasised the different treatment of gratuitous supply, pointing out that a person charged with the offence of trafficking under s 302.4 could be convicted of possession of the substance by reason of s 313.3 if the jury was not satisfied of an intention to sell. She submitted that in those circumstances there was direct inconsistency, stating that this Court should not follow Stevens supra and El Helou supra.

50In supplementary submissions filed after the decision of the High Court in Momcilovic, Ms Ratcliff sought to distinguish that case. She submitted that the Drug Act, unlike the Victorian legislation considered in Momcilovic, did in fact alter and detract from the Commonwealth Act by excluding what she described as a defence of gratuitous supply which she said was available under the Criminal Code, and further, by relying on the admixture provision. She submitted that these differences made it impossible for the sections to operate together, notwithstanding s 300.4 of the Criminal Code.

51In further supplementary submissions Ms Ratcliff submitted that s 25 of the Drug Act was entirely inoperative on account of inconsistency as she said to reach a conclusion of inconsistency requires no analysis of the factual matters in each case. In her attempt to support this submission she pointed to the fact that in Dickson the conspiracy provision in the State legislation was entirely void in its application to Commonwealth property even where the additional requirement of the Criminal Code would be made out. She also submitted that the Drug Act encompassed the offence of agreeing to supply which she described as tantamount at law to the offence of conspiracy, yet ""not requiring proof of an overt act"". She referred to the Explanatory Memorandum to Pt 9.1 as demonstrating a deliberate decision not to include in the definition of trafficking, mere supply without commercial purpose.

52Ms Ratcliff submitted there were a number of areas caught by the Drug Act which were not caught by the Criminal Code. First, she submitted the Drug Act creates the offence of agreement to supply, whereas the Criminal Code does not. Second, she submitted that a mere offer to supply is caught by s 25(1) but not by the Criminal Code. Third, the concept of ""suffering any of the relevant conduct involved in the extended definition of supply"" constitutes an offence unlike the provisions of the Criminal Code. Fourth, she submitted that authorising supply was an offence under the Drug Act but not under the Criminal Code. Fifth, where a person is deemed to be in possession of drugs pursuant to s 7 of the Drug Act, the person deemed to be in such possession is deemed to have possession for the purpose of supply if the amount is trafficable. She submitted that such deeming provisions did not exist under the Criminal Code. Sixth, she submitted that accessorial liability extended to the extended definition of supply in the Drug Act. She submitted that in these respects the Drug Act altered, impaired or detracted from the object or purpose sought to be achieved by the Commonwealth, relying on what was said in New South Wales v The Commonwealth (1983) 151 CLR 302 at 330.

53Ms Ratcliff submitted that the decision in Dickson was not founded on any notion of a special interest that the Commonwealth has in its own property. She submitted instead that inconsistency arose because the State law interfered with policy choices made by the Commonwealth as to the extent of the offence. 

54At the hearing counsel for Ms Ratcliff pointed to the fact that an area of conduct characterised as possession under the Criminal Code included a person who possessed a trafficable amount for gratuitous supply. She pointed to the fact that in these circumstances the maximum penalty under the Criminal Code was two years' imprisonment, whereas under the Drug Act the maximum penalty was 15 years' imprisonment.

55Counsel for Ms Ratcliff also emphasised that whilst an agreement to supply could constitute an offence under the Drug Act, an overt act (actual supply) was necessary under the Criminal Code. She stated that in those circumstances the situation was identical to the position in Dickson.

56Subject to these matters Ms Ratcliff's submissions were identical to those of the appellant.

(c) The Attorney General's submissions

57The Attorney General intervened in the proceedings pursuant to s 78A of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The Attorney General's submissions were adopted by the Crown.

58The Attorney submitted that central to the existence of inconsistency, whether direct or indirect, is the intention of the Commonwealth Parliament properly construed. He submitted that the concurrent operation provision in s 300.4 of the Criminal Code was of significance. 

59The Attorney also noted that inconsistency can result from the inconsistent operation of Commonwealth and State legislation which confer overlapping powers on both federal and State authorities. He submitted that in those circumstances operational inconsistency arises only when each of the State and federal powers are sought to be exercised. He again submitted that legislative intention is a central consideration in determining if there is operational inconsistency.

60The Attorney submitted that the operation of s 300.4 of the Criminal Code in conjunction with s 4C(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth) demonstrated that, contrary to the appellant's contention, there was no indirect inconsistency on the basis that the Criminal Code covers the field. He submitted that this proposition was consistent with El Helou supra and Momcilovic.

61So far as direct inconsistency was concerned, the Attorney pointed to what he described as important differences between the provisions in Dickson and the present case. He submitted that both the federal and Victorian laws in Dickson dealt with the same offence. He submitted that unlike Dickson, in the present case the provisions in question dealt with different offences, supply in the case of the Drug Act and trafficking in respect of the Criminal Code. He accepted that there may be some cases where the offences overlap, but that did not alter the fact that the subject matter of the two laws was different.

62Second, the Attorney noted that in Dickson it was held that in enacting s 11.5 of the Criminal Code the Commonwealth made a deliberate choice to alter the common law by substantially narrowing the offence of conspiracy. The Attorney submitted that no such choice had been made to narrow the criteria of guilt provided for by s 25 of the Drug Act.

63Third, the Attorney submitted that the conspiracy provision in s 321 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic) picked up the common law offence of conspiracy without alteration. He submitted that greater obligations were imposed under the Victorian legislation than under the Commonwealth law. By contrast, he submitted that there was no difference in the mode of conduct prohibited by the respective pieces of legislation in the present case. He submitted that both prohibited possession with the intention of supply. He submitted the fact that the State law covered additional conduct did not give rise to any constitutional inconsistency. The Federal law, he submitted, did not deliberately exclude significant aspects of conduct to which the State offence attached.

64Fourth, the Attorney submitted that the High Court in Dickson held that the Commonwealth legislature had deliberately preserved areas of liberty which the State legislature could not close up. He submitted that s 302.4 was concerned solely with trafficking involving a commercial purpose. He said that by contrast the Drug Act had the purpose of controlling the use and supply of prohibited drugs in New South Wales. He submitted this approach was consistent with Stevens supra and there was nothing said in Dickson or Momcilovic to suggest that Stevens was wrongly decided.

65Fifth, in relation to the ""deliberate legislative choice"" referred to in Dickson, the Attorney pointed to the fact that there was no equivalent provision to s 300.4 under consideration in that case.

66Sixth, the Attorney submitted it was relevant that unlike the present case, what was involved in Dickson was the theft of Commonwealth property.

67The Attorney submitted that the appellant was incorrect in stating that the effect of what Gummow J said in Momcilovic was that if the State law was more stringent than that of the Commonwealth there was inconsistency. He pointed to McWaters v Day (1989) 168 CLR 289 as an example of a case where different rules of conduct were insufficient to establish inconsistency. In this respect he also referred to the remarks of Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Momcilovic at [650] that the purposes of Pt 9.1 of the Criminal Code ""are distinguishable from, and both overlap with and supplement, the purpose of State laws in respect of drug trafficking.""

68The Attorney also submitted that since Momcilovic the argument that inconsistent penalties were capable of giving rise to inconsistency could not succeed. He submitted that the effect of the judgment of Gummow J in Momcilovic was that such provisions could only give rise to operational inconsistency if both State and federal authorities commenced prosecutions and that s 4C(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth) removed the occasion for any direct inconsistency. He submitted that Crennan and Kiefel JJ made it clear that different penalties could give rise to inconsistency but only in the case of covering the field inconsistency.

69The Attorney submitted that the argument that differing modes of trial could give rise to inconsistency was rejected in Momcilovic.

70The Attorney submitted that the admixture rule did not detract from the operation of the Criminal Code so as to attract s 109 of the Constitution. Further, he submitted that having regard to the different thresholds in quantities, it was far from clear that the Drug Act was more stringent than its Commonwealth counterpart.

71At the hearing the Solicitor General emphasised that the fact that the issue of gratuitous supply had not been covered in the Commonwealth legislation did not mean that it had been deliberately left open. He pointed again in that context to s 300.4 of the Criminal Code.

72The Solicitor General said that it was not necessary to look at the extrinsic material because the provisions of s 300.4 indicated the two statutes were intended to operate together. He said that the extrinsic material did not in any event provide a clear indication. He submitted that all that was stated was that the issue of gratuitous supply was not going to be addressed in the Criminal Code. He submitted in any event that the extrinsic material could not replace the words of the section.

Consideration

73In this case the two laws in question are capable of simultaneous obedience. However, the appellant submitted that there is direct inconsistency in the sense that the Drug Act alters, impairs or detracts from the Criminal Code.

74As I indicated in the judgment delivered today, Gedeon v R [2013] NSWCCA 257 (Gedeon), a consideration of the application of s 109 of the Constitution requires an analysis of the laws in question by way of statutory construction to determine the legislative intent. The question whether the Drug Act alters, impairs or detracts from the Criminal Code can only be considered after establishing the legislative intent in accordance with the ordinary rules of construction: Gedeon at [54]-[55]. 

75Section 300.1(1) of the Criminal Code makes it clear that one of the principal purposes of Pt 9.1 is to give effect to the Commonwealth Government's international treaty obligations. Unlike the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) which were considered in Gedeon, the provisions of Pt 9.1 are not limited to imported or exported drugs, but rather, extend to the possession and trafficking of controlled drugs in Australia generally.

76There are a number of matters which should be noted. First, Pt 9.1 does not decriminalise the possession of drugs for gratuitous supply. Rather, it treats such an offence as equivalent to possession with a more limited penalty. Further, even under the Criminal Code, the offence of trafficking could extend to non-commercial supply having regard to the definition in s 300.2 which extends sale to include barter or exchange or agree to sell.

77In that context the submissions of Ms Ratcliff to the effect that the Criminal Code does not make an agreement to supply controlled drugs an offence is incorrect. Further, her submission, as set out at par [52] above, to the effect that the definition of supply in the Drug Act includes a number of matters not caught by the Criminal Code fails to take account of the accessorial liability provisions in s 11.2 of the Criminal Code. Further, the deeming provision in s 302.5 is broadly similar to that contained in s 29 of the Drug Act.

78Of particular importance is the provision in s 300.4 of the Criminal Code which explicitly seeks to preserve concurrent operation even when the same act or omission is an offence under the Criminal Code and a State law and the penalty and fault element in the State law is different. Whilst it is correct that the section will not avoid the consequence of direct inconsistency, R v Credit Tribunal supra at 563, it does make clear that it was not intended by the Commonwealth legislature to cover the field in the relevant area. Its effect in the particular context of the present case was explained by Crennan and Kiefel JJ in Momcilovic in the following terms:

""[654] Following R v Credit Tribunal; Ex parte General Motors Acceptance Corporation (dealing with a provision similar to s 300.4 of the Commonwealth Code), whilst the expression of intention in s 300.4 will not avoid direct inconsistency if such inconsistency exists, taken in its entirety it is a very clear indication that Pt 9.1 is not exhaustive or exclusive in respect of drug trafficking and is not intended to exclude the operation of the Drugs Act where the Drugs Act deals with the same subject matter but contains different penalties. Although not determinative of relevant inconsistency for the purposes of s 109, such an expression of intention assists in resolving, as a matter of statutory construction, whether the Commonwealth law covers the subject matter exhaustively or exclusively. In the present case the statements of intention found in s 300.4 accord with the intention of Pt 9.1 ascertained by a process of construction. There is no reason why effect should not be given to these statements.""(Citations omitted)

79In that case their Honours without reliance on s 300.4 concluded that the context in which Pt 9.1 was created did not support an inference of intended exclusivity:

""[652] The context in which the Commonwealth offence was created does not support an inference of intended exclusivity; rather it supports the contrary inference. The aim of prosecuting drug trafficking offences in Australia can only be aided by concurrent and parallel Commonwealth and State laws for that purpose. The Commonwealth law enabling the prosecution of a drug trafficking offence is not detracted from, or impaired by, the concurrent State law which permits the same.""

See also R v El Helou supra at [31].

80I do not think that reliance on the extrinsic materials referred to by the appellant and Ms Ratcliff alters the position. Whatever the Committee said about the desirability of uniform laws, the difference between gratuitous supply and supply for reward, and the difficulty of the concept of supply, the Explanatory Memorandum and the Second Reading Speech relating to Pt 9.1 make it clear as provided in the Criminal Code itself that it was intended to operate concurrently with State laws. 

81I have summarised the relevant provisions of the Drug Act and its scope in my judgment in Gedeon and it is unnecessary to repeat what I have said in that case.

82The question is whether in that context the inclusion of gratuitous supply in the offence of supply in the Drug Act alters, impairs or detracts from the Criminal Code by preventing conduct left untouched by the federal law: Victoria v The Commonwealth (1937) 58 CLR 618 at 630; Telstra Corporation Ltd v Worthing [1999] HCA 12; (1999) 197 CLR 61 at [27]-[28]; Dickson supra at [13], [22].

83There are two matters which should be noted. First, this is not a case where conduct untouched by the federal criminal law was prosecuted by the Drug Act. Each piece of legislation criminalises possession, the difference being that the federal legislation does not treat possession with an intention to supply gratuitously to a third person as a more serious offence. In this sense this case is different to Dickson. Second, unlike Dickson s 300.4 expressly provides for the concurrent operation of the legislation.

84In these circumstances, I do not think the State legislation alters, impairs or detracts from the operation of the federal law. It does not criminalise conduct which the federal law deliberately excluded. Rather, it has classified gratuitous supply as a different, albeit more serious offence.

85Nor does the State law undermine and negate the criteria for the existence and adjudication of criminal liability adopted by the federal law. The criteria adopted by the federal legislature expressly leaves open by virtue of s 300.4 concurrent operation of a State statute even in circumstances where the fault element is different. Thus it accommodates State legislation creating the offence of supply where the fault element is intention to supply, as distinct from trafficking where the fault element is intention to sell. In that sense there is no direct collision between the two pieces of legislation: Dickson supra at [22]; Blackley v Devondale Cream (Vic) Pty Ltd (1968) 117 CLR 253 at 258.

86This is not to give s 300.4 of the Criminal Code an operation purporting to validate a State law that is otherwise inconsistent with the federal law contrary to what was said by Mason J in R v Credit Tribunal supra. It does not operate to eliminate direct inconsistency of the kind which arises when a Commonwealth and State law make contradictory provisions on the same topic. Nor does it seek to validate a State law which alters, impairs or detracts from a federal law by taking away a right or privilege conferred by the federal law, or impose a restriction on that right and privilege: Momcilovic supra at [240]. Its effect was summarised by Gummow J in Momcilovic supra:

""[272] The result is that a provision such as s 300.4 of the Code requires the federal law in question to be read and construed in a particular fashion, namely as not disclosing a subject matter or purpose with which it deals exhaustively and exclusively, and as not immunising the rule of conduct it creates from qualification by State law. To the federal law so read and construed, s 109 then applies and operates to render inoperative any State law inconsistent with it. But by reason of the construction to be given to the federal law, there will be greater likelihood of a concurrent operation of the two laws in question.""

87In this case for the reasons I have given, there is no collision between the two laws and they can operate concurrently.

88I should add a number of matters. First, it does not seem to me that the decision of Gummow J in Momcilovic on this issue (with whom French CJ and Bell J agreed) was dependant on the penalties in the Victorian legislation being less stringent than those contained for the equivalent offences in the Criminal Code. In the passage immediately preceding the reference to the penalties being less stringent, his Honour referred to the fact that the difference between that case and Dickson was the fact that the State law in Dickson rendered criminal conduct that was deliberately excluded from the federal law. In the present case as in Momcilovic the State law does not have that effect.

89Second, once it is demonstrated that the State law in its substantial operation did not alter, impair or detract from the federal law and the federal law was not intended to cover the field, the fact that the particular mode of trial and penalties contained in the Drug Act are different to those in the Criminal Code will not give rise to inconsistency under s 109: Momcilovic supra at [277], [480], [645], [655]-[656].

90Third, the appellant's submission that there was indirect inconsistency is directly contrary to the decision of the majority in Momcilovic. El Helou supra, to the extent it decided that there was no indirect inconsistency between the Drug Act and the Criminal Code, was correctly decided. Contrary to the appellant's submission, the High Court in Dickson did not state that El Helou was incorrect: Dickson supra at fn (39).

91Fourth, the admixture rule in s 4 of the Drug Act does not affect the position. A different mode of calculating the quantity of a prohibited drug, which might or might not work unfavourably to the accused having regard to the different amounts of drugs in question said to constitute a trafficable quantity, does not in my opinion alter, impair or detract from the provisions of the Criminal Code to give rise to a s 109 inconsistency in circumstances where the intention of the Commonwealth legislature as indicated by s 300.4 was that the Acts were intended to have concurrent operation.

92Finally, I do not think that the provisions of ss 308.1(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code affects the position. Section 308.1(3) allows for a contravention of the Commonwealth legislation to be tried, punished or otherwise dealt with as if it were an offence against the law of the State. The purpose of the provision which is made clear in the Note to s 308.1(3) and in the Explanatory Memorandum, is to enable an offender charged with this offence to take advantage of the alternative methods to conviction and punishment which have been devised to deal with such offences. Thus, the restriction on punishment in s 308.1(4) recognises the fact that notwithstanding s 308.1(3) it is the Commonwealth offence and not an equivalent State offence which is being dealt with.

Conclusion

93It follows that the appeal should be dismissed.

94BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons and with the orders proposed by Bathurst CJ.

95HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

96BLANCH J: I agree that for the reasons given by the Chief Justice the appeal should be dismissed.

97PRICE J: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

2705880,R v Pound [2013] NSWDC 336,"SENTENCE


	
	HIS HONOUR: Andrew John Pound appears today for sentence in relation to two offences, to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and continued his pleas of guilty in this Court.
	
	
	The offences to which he pleaded guilty at the Local Court and in this Court are, firstly, that he, on 20 October 2012 at Newtown did recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm upon Daniel Marino. That offence is referred to in the Court Attendance Notice as a Sequence 1 offence and will be shortly referred to from time to time as the “recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm” offence.
	
	
	The second offence to which he pleaded guilty is an offence of carrying a firearm, to wit a small calibre handgun, with disregard for the safety of himself and Daniel Marino at 79/1-17 Alice Street, Newtown. This offence is Sequence 2 of the Court Attendance Notices.
	
	
	The offence of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(2) Crimes Act 1900 carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. It has a standard non-parole period of four years imprisonment.
	
	
	The offence of carrying a firearm with disregard for safety contrary to s 93G(1)(c) Crimes Act carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. I am informed by the Crown it has no standard non-parole period.
	
	
	I am also required to take into account the offence on a Form 1 of cultivating a prohibited plant on 20 October 2012 at Newtown, the prohibited plant being cannabis. That matter on the Form 1 involves an offence brought contrary to s 23(1)(a) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. I will refer to that in the Facts and in the context of dealing with the treatment of matters on a Form 1.
	
	
	The offences, as revealed in the particulars in the Court Attendance Notices, were committed on 20 October 2012 in the early hours of the morning. The offender was arrested on 26 October 2012 and has been in custody since that date. Obviously the time spent in custody will be taken into account.
	
	
	There was a statement of facts tendered to the Court and other material annexed to it which I will briefly summarise. As it transpired in the context of the evidence given by the offender it would appear to be in effect, if not so stated, an agreed statement of facts.
	
	
	On 19 and 20 October 2012 the offender lived alone in a flat at Alice Street, Newtown. He was at the time not the holder of a New South Wales firearms licence in any capacity. The father of the victim of the offence of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm, Daniel Marino, lived in the same block of flats but on a lower level. On Friday night, 19 October 2012, the victim and three associates of him, named in the facts as Jason Galea, Ben McCarthy and Adam Goncalves, went to Kings Cross where they consumed alcohol.
	
	
	It is said in the facts that Goncalves and Galea each digested an ecstasy tablet, that is an MDMA tablet, at around 10pm. At about 3am Mr Marino, the victim of the principal offence and his group left Kings Cross and returned, intending to reside that night at the father’s address at Newtown. It was expected that he would not be home.
	
	
	As it transpired the victim’s father was home and the group decided to leave. The offender was awake. He had met the victim before in the context of seeing him around the apartments visiting his father and the offender invited the victim and his friends up to his unit.
	
	
	They all sat down in lounge seats and when Mr McCarthy was in the toilet the offender produced a .22 calibre Harrington & Richardson seven shot revolver. He began to spin the handgun around in his finger, using what is suspected to be the trigger guard. This appears not to have been done to threaten the group.
	
	
	After a brief period the offender stopped spinning the firearm and he put the gun in his pants. The group, including the accused, sat down in various lounge chairs. Mr Marino at some point sat on the lounge occupied by the accused. Mr Pound told him to move.
	
	
	The two began to taunt one another in a jovial fashion. At this point Mr Pound produced the gun and held it with his finger on the trigger. The victim said, “Don’t point that thing at me” and he tapped the barrel with his two fingers.
	
	
	At this point the firearm discharged with the projectile striking the victim in the left eye and continuing its path until it stopped behind the right eye.
	
	
	The facts state:
	


“…. It is not alleged that the accused deliberately shot the victim. Panicking, the entire group, along with the offender, left the address and made their way outside the main building entrance. Outside the unit complex the accused, using his own mobile phone, contacted triple-0 at 3.44am and requested an ambulance indicating, “I’ve shot my friend in the eye with a gun.”

Awoken by the commotion, the father of the victim left his unit and joined the group. The victim’s friends identified the offender as having shot the victim.”


	
	The victim was walked eventually downstairs by the group, who had obviously returned, and taken to the waiting ambulance. He was later conveyed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. The facts state that his injuries reveal a loss of sight in his left eye and partial blindness in his right eye. The firearm’s projectile entered Mr Marino slightly above his left eye, leaving parts of the projectile behind both eyes as it fragmented.
	
	
	A police search of the crime scene revealed blood spatter on the far side of the lounge room on the coffee table, lounge, floor and window. Other blood spatter was located on items of clothing. No firearm or firearm related items were located inside or in the vicinity of the flat.
	
	
	Also located during this search were the six cannabis plants which were being cultivated by the prisoner in a spare bedroom, and are concerned with the matter on the Form 1. There was fluorescent lighting, potting, watering, concealment and other aids to cultivation.
	
	
	The offender resided in the address alone and his possession of the cannabis is not in dispute. Police continued to investigate the location of the weapon. The offender told them that Goncalves had the gun, although he initially denied knowing where the gun was.
	
	
	Goncalves subsequently informed the police that he had possession of the pistol which he produced to them. He provided an additional statement that day alleging that after the shooting, Pound dropped the gun, Goncalves then picked up the gun, ran down the stairs and out of the unit complex. He buried the firearm underneath a pile of leaves, obviously in a panic.
	
	
	The prisoner presented himself to Newtown Police on 26 October 2012, I would take from that that his identity at that point had been well established. In fact, I take from the facts that he had already spoken to the police in relation to the matter.
	
	
	The offender was placed under arrest and taken into custody, he declined to participate in an electronic interview and he was charged with the matters before the Court.
	
	
	I have two expert certificates relating to the injuries suffered by the victim including details of operative treatment, noting the victim was operated on by medical staff on 20 October 2012 and discharged from hospital on 26 October 2012.
	
	
	The permanent injuries suffered by the victim are, according to the medical report, a permanently blind left eye with related physical impairment of the eyelid and deformation of the eye with restricted eye movements. There are other comments made in relation to the extent of the impairment which probably are more relevant to a claim for civil damages.
	
	
	At the time of the commission of the offence the offender, who was born on 11 November 1980, would have been, in my calculation, 31 years of age, about to turn 32. He is now 33 years of age.
	
	
	His criminal history shows a number of appearances in the Children’s Court for crimes of dishonesty and other related matters, as well as other findings of guilt over a period of time between 1993 and 1999.
	
	
	In 1998 and 1999 he was also found guilty in the Children’s Court of offences of intimidation, resisting a police officer, possessing an unauthorised firearm and possessing ammunition. For those offences he was dealt with in accordance with the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act, usually with probation.
	
	
	His appearances as an adult in the Local Court include a number of convictions which include possession or custody of a knife in a public place, for which he was placed on a bond in 1999, intimidation of a police officer in 2000 for which he was fined, breaking, entering and stealing and damaging property for which he was variously fined or placed on bonds, a common assault conviction in 2005 for which he was placed on a two year good behaviour bond with conditions requiring supervision to suppress or address anger management and alcohol rehabilitation and a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2006 for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of three months.
	
	
	He has a conviction for driving with high range prescribed concentration of alcohol in 2007, for which he was fined and disqualified, an offence of goods in custody and possession of drugs in 2008 for which he was fined and a conviction in 2010 for being found on, entering or leaving drug premises for which he was also fined.
	
	
	According to the Probation and Parole Service he also has a conviction for which he was placed on a recognisance for breaches of Commonwealth law relating to matters of dishonesty.
	
	
	All of his prior convictions, as I said, were either in the Children’s Court or the Local Court. The character of the offending, however, and the period of time over which it was committed reveals, as I must conclude, that his criminal history does not entitle him to any particular leniency.
	
	
	I will deal with the issue of aggravating factors under s 21A shortly.
	
	
	There is a Probation and Parole Service report which deals with the previous supervision of the offender by bonds, a Commonwealth recognisance and a parole order.
	
	
	When subject to supervision after a breach of Commonwealth law, making some allowance for his medical condition to which I will refer in a moment, he was found to be in that supervision inconsistent in his reporting, he continued to have drug and alcohol issues that he failed to address, and suffered fluctuating periods of depression.
	
	
	It was found that he was inconsistent in his medical and mental health compliance. Whilst in custody I note he has failed three prescribed urine tests relating to the presence of prohibited drugs in his system. The Probation and Parole Service report notes that he completed his parole without any significant issues.
	
	
	In relation to his background it notes that he has had a very poor education, having left school at about the age of 12 and having completed only to Year 6.
	
	
	He has an employment history of short term casual positions, largely in the areas of gardening and bar work. He worked, as I understand it, in more recent years as a casual but full-time worker with the local council doing landscaping and lawn mowing work, which is work he held for about two years.
	
	
	It was in these circumstances, as I understand his evidence, that he found the firearm the subject of the particular charge Sequence 2 and the firearm used in the wounding of the victim.
	
	
	He has been receiving a disability support pension from about 2010 for apparently mental health issues including some delusions and in respect of a serious illness which is addressed in a report that I will refer to in a moment.
	
	
	The Probation and Parole Service reflected upon issues in relation to his background including his father’s sexual abuse of his half sister, his treatment over a period of time for mood disorders, particularly anxiety and depression and his more recent prescription of antidepressants and mood stabiliser drugs which have made him feel better, as I understand it, whilst in custody.
	
	
	He conceded to the Probation and Parole Service Officer that whilst at large, prior to the commission of this offence, although it is not in one sense directly connected to the offence of the recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm, that he was “totally out of control” with heavy drinking and use of cannabis prior to his arrest.
	
	
	He has a long history of alcohol and cannabis abuse, and in recent years he has used crystal methamphetamine and was doing so up until a month before his arrest. Apart from detoxifying in custody he has had no rehabilitation assistance or direction.
	
	
	According to the Probation and Parole Service and in his evidence before me he accepted full responsibility for the offending behaviour and agreed with the police facts, stating amongst other things the cannabis plants were for his personal use.
	
	
	It is quoted in the report that he felt “terrible” that he had caused such serious injury to the victim. The summary of the Probation and Parole Service report is that being a single male with a history of violence, alcohol and poly drug abuse, with mental health issues and anxiety, the offender is a person who, “if he is to have any chance of leading a normal, lawful life, will need to address his addictions.”
	
	
	The report says he will benefit from completing a residential rehabilitation facility programme upon his release to the community. He will also benefit from a mental health assessment in the community and if necessary appropriate therapy.
	
	
	He is suitable for a medium level of intervention, requiring a case plan that will address alcohol and drug abuse issues, anger management and will require random urine analysis for drug and alcohol testing. He also requires direction and assessment and counselling in relation to mental health issues.
	
	
	All of these matters are of course for the Parole Authority in due course.
	
	
	I have a report from an organisation known as ACON which has provided a great deal of background information in relation to a condition from which the offender suffers that I do not propose to detail publicly.
	
	
	The offender has tested positive to a particular illness or condition with which ACON is very familiar in its work. This condition makes the offender susceptible to opportunistic infections such as pneumonia and cancers.
	
	
	According to the report that was tendered in this matter, people with the offender’s condition can suffer a variety of health problems associated with the condition.
	
	
	The author of the report notes that in the experience of ACON it believes the offender will have difficulty in accessing relevant experienced doctors and only those persons hospitalised within the Sydney metropolitan area, under the supervision of the Corrective Services, can have regular access to a relatively experienced practitioner and appropriate medication.
	
	
	It is said in the report that there is success with treatment of this condition with what is described as “combination therapy” which includes medication regimes including timely and correct ingestion of medication, appropriate diet and the like.
	
	
	The report notes limitations in access to medications within the prison system. It is also noted that people in custody cannot participate in clinical trial programmes for new medications and there are difficulties in custody from ACON’s experience in obtaining a carefully managed and specially balanced diet and related matters.
	
	
	It is noted from the report that US studies have shown that whilst in custody psychological stress may impair the body’s immune system and psychological factors of depression, anger and fatigue often experienced in prison life have a link to the development of related illnesses.
	
	
	The report also refers to cases of discrimination against prisoners by other prisoners within the confines of prison where people have the offender’s condition and there are a number of serious threats to continued health likely to exist amongst other prisoners.
	
	
	The report also refers to what it describes as the offender’s “mental health issues”. The report asks the Court to consider the “humanitarian consequences” of discharging the offender into the correction system, noting the “very real likelihood that his health may deteriorate quickly with little opportunity for early intervention”.
	
	
	In relation to the matters arising out of that evidence, obviously there are many ways in which the physical health of an offender may have an impact on the sentencing process.
	
	
	It may have a relevance to the assessment of the objective facts, it may be a matter considered as relevant subjective circumstance, either as a mitigating factor or a matter relevant to the assessment of the appropriate non parole period.
	
	
	It has long been the practice of courts to take into account circumstances that make imprisonment more burdensome for offenders, including considerations relating to the offender’s health and many of those cases to which I have impliedly referred are concerned with the same condition suffered by the offender.
	
	
	One need only cite the decision of The Queen v Bailey, from the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in 1988, The Queen v Smith [1987] 44 SASR 587 and of course the decision of Bailey in the High Court on a special leave application.
	
	
	It is also to be borne in mind what has been said about the relevance of the health of a prisoner to be committed to custody discussed in decisions such as Vachalec (1981) 1 NSWLR 351-353 and Badanjak [2004] NSWCCA 395, particularly at [11].
	
	
	Relevant factors will include the need for medical treatment in custody, particular hardships in prison, the likelihood of the offender’s reasonable needs being met whilst imprisoned.
	
	
	I have had full regard to what has been said in the ACON report. The condition the offender suffers from existed at the time of the offending.
	
	
	I have received no material from Justice Health to say that the offender’s condition cannot be treated to the extent that Justice Health is capable of doing so and whilst I have full regard to some of the reservations ACON has concerning the limitations of treatment within the prison I have no direct evidence from the offender, or from an independent source intimately connected with the treatment of the offender, that there are particular hardships beyond what, as I said earlier, may be reasonably considered from the ACON report.
	
	
	Of course, ill health cannot be allowed to become a “licence to commit crime”, to quote from the Sentencing Bench Book, nor can offenders expect to escape punishment because of the condition of their health. It is in fact the responsibility of the Correctional Services and particularly Justice Health, under the auspices of the Department of Corrections, to provide appropriate care and treatment, a process with which the Court cannot interfere.
	
	
	I am mindful that there will be some additional burden on the offender by reason of his state of health but the evidence in relation to that matter in the specific case is, to be fairly said, quite incomplete.
	
	
	In relation to the material that has been presented on behalf of the offender I also have a report from Dr John Jacmon, a psychologist retained by the offender’s legal representatives. This is a very lengthy report but in summary, that report concludes, based on the psychometric testing conducted by the psychologist and other tests, and I am pleased to report it is one psychologist’s report where the psychologist actually conducted appropriate testing within his expertise, that the offender has symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder type II, which consists of successive episodes of depression and hypermania, interspersed with periods of normality.
	
	
	This is a lifetime condition for which there is no effective treatment or management according to the psychologist. It is stated that at the time surrounding the incident with which I am concerned, the offender was undergoing what could be described as a depressive episode, his functioning at the time of the incident was markedly impaired by alcohol use consistent with an assessment that he had a longstanding alcohol and cannabis dependence disorder.
	
	
	The symptoms of his disorders include during the hypermanic phase restlessness, increased energy, active euphoria, poor judgment, self destructive behaviour, impulsive behaviour. In the depressive stage there is a prominent downturn in mood, loss of confidence, confused thinking and difficulties in concentration.
	
	
	It was noted that alcohol abuse dependency leads to poor attention and concentration, poor abstract problem solving skills, deficiencies in memory, deficiencies in executive function and motor deficits.
	
	
	Marijuana dependency impairs learning and memory cognitive functions such as judgment, coordination, ability to regulate movement, capacity to recall events and ability to shift attention from one item or issue to another. These impairments can affect a person’s judgments and reasoning.
	
	
	The psychologist opines that the offending indicated markedly diminished capacity for judgment with little thought to the consequences. The psychologist said that the offender was remorseful and took full responsibility for his offending actions, deeply regretted the permanent harm he had caused.
	
	
	A treatment plan is proposed in the report to try and strengthen drug and alcohol use relapse prevention skills to apply anger management skills based upon the concept of cognitive behaviour therapy, or CBT. He recommended that the offender be referred to a psychologist by his general practitioner on his release.
	
	
	I need not go into the details of the treatment plan contained within the report. Those matters of course will be a matter of record and are a matter for consideration by the Parole Authority and those that will supervise him on parole.
	
	
	In relation to the defence case, the offender gave evidence that he was intoxicated on the night and that the other people who came to his flat also appeared to be intoxicated.
	
	
	He said that he was just at home having a few drinks. He heard people downstairs and invited them up to his place. He gave evidence that the firearm that he discharged was, as he described it, “quite rusty”.
	
	
	He told me that he had found the firearm in 2007 when working down on the Cooks River near Tempe, when he was mowing lawns for the local Council. He said that he had put it away in storage and to use his words, “lost it for a while” but refound it in June 2012. He said that he had no reason for keeping the firearm. It just stayed in a toolbox until a couple of days before he brought it out to show a few friends. I take it people other than the people present on the morning of 20 October 2012.
	
	
	He said to me that he did not know that it was loaded when he found it, but he did remember putting a bullet in it, maybe two days before the incident, or “something like that” but did not realise that it was still in there when he had taken it out on the night of the shooting.
	
	
	He said that he had some .22 calibre bullets from about 10 years before. He could not recall having pointed the gun at people before and had only put the bullet in the gun to see whether the firearm worked. I will analysis this evidence, of course, in due course.
	
	
	He said that he had consumed three to four longneck beers that night, starting at 11 o'clock, admitted to being a heavy drinker and noted his propensity for getting into trouble when in an intoxicated state and he noted also his positive test for the use of marijuana whilst in custody.
	
	
	He said that when he was first locked up he was very depressed. He was not receiving treatment for his mental health programmes and had smoked pot to relieve these symptoms, but he had not smoked “pot” for about eight months.
	
	
	Before going into custody he had been being treated for the condition that is the subject of comment by ACON and is receiving the same medication as was prescribed to him by Dr Rimington at RPA Hospital.
	
	
	He noted and conceded that his previous attempts at rehabilitation of drug and alcohol issues had been half-hearted but then when he was released from custody on this occasion he hoped to receive counselling and do his “absolute best” to stop drinking.
	
	
	He told me he was currently in the general prison population, not remanded in segregation. Although he was in an area with other “medical holds”.
	
	
	His mother gave evidence of her concern for the family of the victim, the victim himself and, of course, what she described as “the heartbreak” for her son to be in this situation. She had been receiving some treatment and medication for anxiety and she would hope that the offender would reside with her on his release from custody, she lives at Constitution Hill, to the west of Sydney.
	
	
	I accept that the offender’s mother supports him and will continue to support him on his release, which will be of assistance to him. She noted in cross-examination that his response to any psychiatric assistance in the past, particularly in his youth, had been “sporadic”.
	
	
	In relation to his background there are a number of histories available which were adopted by the offender in the psychological report and in the Probation and Parole Service report.
	
	
	The offender has variously lived in New South Wales and Queensland, as I have pointed out his father had sexually assaulted his half sister and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, as I would understand it.
	
	
	The father was described as a “violent alcoholic”. He had had no contact with his father since the revelations concerning the sexual assault but as was apparent from the evidence from his mother he had a close relationship with his mother.
	
	
	As I mentioned earlier he had only completed Year 6. He did not attend high school and freely admitted, as I understand from the history, that his juvenile years were spent largely associating with what were described as criminal associates, the use of alcohol and drugs.
	
	
	I note a matter that was raised by the victim’s mother in the reading of the victim impact statement. It is a matter that is reflected in the Probation and Parole Service report. It requires addressing at this point just briefly.
	
	
	I am informed from source material in the reports that the offender has previously been charged with murder. This is a matter in respect of which he spent a year in custody. The matter was no-billed.
	
	
	There is reference in, I believe, the psychologist’s report, that he was subsequently either re-arrested in relation to this charge or the same type of charge but was acquitted by a jury.
	
	
	I cannot determine from this, for the purposes of reasonable fact finding, that the offender has a proclivity for violence, which was the suggestion, I would have understood, from the mother.
	
	
	Obviously she is very distressed about the injuries suffered by her son. But for professional judges determining the facts of the cases, based upon proven events, these past events are, it is to be fairly said, irrelevant to this sentencing exercise.
	
	
	It should be fairly said as far as this Court is concerned, apart from the hearsay material I have been provided, I have been provided with no other direct information about those matters.
	
	
	His times in custody in relation to these other matters however, have a relevance to this case because it is said that these have exacerbated his depressive symptoms, on his release from custody and return to drugs and alcohol on each occasion.
	
	
	He was in a relationship with a woman after his release from gaol in 2006 who was a heavy drinker. That was a relationship that broke up after three years and the offender continued to abuse alcohol and drugs and had been drinking heavily, as he admitted, up until the time of the commission of the offence.
	
	
	In the personality assessment inventory, conducted by the psychologist, he noted a number of aspects of the offender’s functioning which showed substantial impairment, particularly impairment in his personality function, both by reason of elevated anxiety, by reason of depressive symptoms, which reflected in a loss of interest in normal activities and related matters which exhibited themselves in his frustration in his relationship with other people and him being socially isolated with few interpersonal relationships.
	
	
	He was also assessed through this testing to be likely to be impulsive and emotionally labile, to feel misunderstood by others, tending to be angry and suspicious, while also being anxious and needy. He is also said to be ambivalent about his interactions with others.
	
	
	His antisocial behavioural testing revealed a score that was consistent with individuals who “are likely to manifest behaviour that is reckless and potentially dangerous to themselves and all those around them”. That assessment is of course quite prescient in the context of the facts of this case.
	
	
	It was noted by the psychologist that a person with his scores and a history of antisocial acts often manifest these matters in a conduct disorder during adolescence which is, as I said, reflected in the offender’s criminal history and illegal activities by him. There were high scores in relation to alcohol and drug dependency, as I have earlier pointed out.
	
	
	The psychologist concluded:
	


“The areas of elevated scores and associated results in the personality assessment inventory suggest anxiety, depression and drug and alcohol problems. Some symptoms in the background suggest bipolar disorder and the likelihood that Mr Pound is currently in a depressive cycle.”

 


	
	The defence counsel provided written submissions which I will briefly summarise. It was submitted that the case was analogous to a decision of Channells, an unreported decision from 1997. It was submitted that the victim’s actions were to some extent a causal nexus leading to the injuries, although in this case the social milieu was different as the accused was relaxed amongst friends and showing off.
	
	
	It was submitted that the facts in Channells were more serious, given the prior conduct of the offender and also reference was made to another authority where it was submitted that the category of offending was more serious. It was submitted that this was not worse case offending and it was the case that in the submissions that the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Westerman [2004] NSWCCA 161, at [17], were to be considered. This I have taken into account.
	
	
	It was submitted that the evidence from the psychologist’s report and the ACON report reveal that the offender has conditions which affect his daily life, such as his chronic problems with alcohol and marijuana, to regulate his mood swings.
	
	
	Reference was made to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of De La Rosa [2010] NSWCCA 194 to which I will refer in a moment and that because of what was described as the offender’s mental disorder, less weight should be given to general deterrence because the offender was said to be “not an appropriate medium for making an example to others”. What was said to be his mental “incapacity” is to be weighed and evaluated in light of the particular facts and circumstances of this particular case.
	
	
	It was submitted also, or alternatively, that his physical and mental conditions create special circumstances warranting an adjustment of the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of the sentence, given that he would have difficulty in custody with his conditions.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the offender that the Court might consider a suspended sentence, or a longer period of parole supervision. It must be pointed out, of course, that in order to suspend a term of imprisonment pursuant to s 12 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act the term of imprisonment needs to be two years or less. A sentence of two years or less for the totality of criminality with which I am concerned would be quite clearly ‘manifestly inadequate’.
	
	
	Reference was made to the pre-sentence report and the support of the mother and the attitude of the offender to the need for supervision. Reliance was also placed on the opinions expressed by Dr Jacmon and the need for treatment in the treatment plan that he advised.
	
	
	It was submitted, in the combination of oral and written submissions, that the Court should take into account that the offence was not planned, there was a degree of pre-trial disclosure and assistance provided by the offender in locating the firearm, that the offender was remorseful and took responsibility for his actions and that he was entitled to a discount to reflect his plea of guilty at the first reasonable opportunity.
	
	
	It was submitted that the objective facts did not reveal any malice or cruelty or motivation of hatred by the offender, which is correct.
	
	
	It is submitted that the Court should consider the humanitarian consequences of the offender’s medical condition and that whilst it was acknowledged that certain aggravating factors such as the use of the gun, acting without regard to public safety were relevant matters, it was submitted also that he was unlikely to re-offend and he had the support of his family, particularly his mother.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the Court would need to have regard to the standard non-parole period, the objective seriousness of the offending in the context of the use of the weapon, in this case a dangerous weapon, the serious extent of the injury and the fact that the recklessness was of a very high order.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the recklessness and dangerousness of the offender’s conduct can be seen in the context of a fundamental understanding of firearms, as the Crown put it very succinctly, “you should never point a firearm in the direction of another.”
	
	
	Further, the offender had put a bullet in the firearm and forgotten about it, on his version, and was handling a firearm when he was intoxicated, which was an extremely dangerous situation. That is clearly correct in this case.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the objective seriousness of offending fell at the higher end of the scale, that general deterrence was important and it was submitted on behalf of the Crown also that as the injury, or damage, to the victim was substantial that was a particular aggravating factor under s 21A(2).
	
	
	The Crown pointed to the significance of the additional offence as an ongoing offence and the need to take the matter on the Form 1 into account with the principal offence.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the Crown that the report of the psychologist and the contents of the ACON report were, as I understood her submission, “of no relevance”.
	
	
	It was submitted there was no significant hardship rendered to the offender in custody and there was no causal connection between the conditions with which he suffered and the offending behaviour. The offences were more connected to his alcohol intake on the night.
	
	
	It was also conceded in the course of submissions that the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty was such that a 25% discount was to be given. I was also invoked to consider the decision of the High Court in Muldrock in relation to the standard non-parole period, which of course I will do.
	
	
	I turn now to an assessment of the criminality in the context of the many legal issues I have to consider. It is to be borne in mind in this sentencing exercise that I am sentencing the offender for two offences which are related and overlap, but which are also separate in material respects.
	
	
	The offender would not have inflicted grievous bodily harm upon the victim if he had not had in his possession firearm which was capable of discharging a lethal projectile and carried that firearm with him on the morning in question without regard for the safety of himself and the victim.
	
	
	Thus in sentencing the offender I am required to sentence the offender in accordance with the principles encapsulated in the decision of the majority of the High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly at [45].
	
	
	I am required to consider the totality of the criminality of the offender and reflect that totality of criminality, bearing in mind of course I have to take into account the matter on the Form 1, by appropriate degrees of concurrency and accumulation if appropriate. It is appropriate in this case to approach the matter in that way.
	
	
	There is also, as I said earlier, the consideration of the matter on the Form 1 to be taken into account in relation to the principal offence, that is the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm. The consideration of Form 1 matters has been undertaken in a number of decisions but the starting point of consideration of this matter is the ‘Guideline judgment’ of 2002 in respect of Form 1 matters, at (2002) 56 NSWLR 146.
	
	
	In that decision it was held the fact of a matter or matters to be taken into account on a Form 1 means that greater weight would ordinarily be given for the need for personal deterrence and the community’s entitlement to extract retribution. I appreciate of course these are all matters of degree, having regard to the relationship of the Form 1 matter to the principal offence and the character of the offending on the Form 1 matter.
	
	
	The Court said that “The entire point of the process is usually to impose a longer sentence or to alter the nature of a sentence that would have been imposed if the principal offence has stood alone”.
	
	
	It is wrong to suggest, the Court said, that the additional penalty should be small, sometimes it will be substantial. In this particular case the additional penalty, if it may be described as that given the character of the offending, does not need to be substantial.
	
	
	However, the Court also noted that the sentencing process is only concerned with the principal offence, not to determine appropriate sentences for matters listed on a Form 1 or to determine an overall sentence that would be appropriate for all the offences and apply a discount giving appropriate weight to the matters referred to in the judgment.
	
	
	The Court stated that “deterrence and retribution are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence”.
	
	
	Of course there are limitations in this regard including, as the Court pointed out, the maximum penalty for the principal offence and also the principle of totality. Rarely is it appropriate for the judge to signify the extent of any particular increase.
	
	
	In the context of the submissions that have been made and of course the evidence in this case, including importantly the statement of facts prepared by the prosecution and accepted by the accused, it is clear that the offence of reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm is a very serious offence of this type.
	
	
	Firstly, in dealing with the recklessness revealed in the facts and the offender’s own evidence, that was a high degree. The offender, of course, did not intend to cause harm to the victim, nor wish harm to him. However, at the time he acted oblivious to the presence of a projectile in the firearm that he had placed there, the handling of the gun in circumstances where he was intoxicated, reveals a high degree of recklessness.
	
	
	The prior loading of the firearm, obviously, for no understandable reason, and then forgetting that the firearm was loaded also represents a high degree of recklessness on the part of the offender.
	
	
	This was not a case of inadvertence or negligence or mere oversight. He produced the firearm, he had loaded the firearm, albeit some period of time before, it was pointed at the victim and it was obviously inappropriately handled, with his hand in the vicinity of the trigger mechanism.
	
	
	The material available to me of course is somewhat deficient in that I have not been given access to the firearm to conduct an inspection or any particular relevant expert opinion that would assist me in understanding how the firearm could be discharged in the manner revealed in the facts.
	
	
	But clearly when the firearm either was touched by the victim or by some involuntary or other motion of the offender, the trigger was engaged and the bullet was discharged from the firearm.
	
	
	I have no information available to me in the facts or any other source as to whether the firearm had a safety mechanism that could be engaged or disengaged. It is quite clear though that the recklessness, as I have said, was a very high degree.
	
	
	Obviously the grievous bodily harm is also of a very high degree. The victim has been permanently disfigured. He has lost the sight of one eye with the risk of potential further damage to his other eye, in the circumstances outlined in the facts.
	
	
	Of course the future risk to his right eye is not the subject of any expert opinion. Grievous bodily harm can cover a range of really serious bodily harm. It might include a broken arm, it could include paraplegia or quadriplegia.
	
	
	One could always think of cases that might be regarded as more serious. This was very much the discussion of the High Court in Veen (No 2) when asked to consider worst case scenarios where the majority observed that one could always conjure up a worst case scenario than the case at bar.
	
	
	The objective facts of this matter are that the victim however, has been permanently disfigured and permanently disabled in a significant way that will affect him all of his life by reason of the conduct of the offender.
	
	
	In this regard I note the victim impact statement, read by the victim’s mother. The impact upon the victim is, I fully understand, shared by his family. That statement reflects upon the harm done to the victim and the family and the physical and emotional toll that the victim has suffered, even allowing for the fact that the offender did not intend this particular harm.
	
	
	His possession of the firearm, his production of it, his handling of it, his prior loading of it and his use of it, all contributed to the harm suffered by the victim.
	
	
	I have taken into account, of course, the victim impact statement in accordance with the requirements of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act but it must be fairly said, even if it could be noted that the contents of the victim impact statement are not an oath and not subject to the test of cross-examination, they reveal much that could be reasonably expected to be found from the events as reflected in the facts.
	
	
	The victim impact statement introduces a very human and personal dimension to consideration of the harm done to the victim and the family, which is obviously an important matter to be taken into account for sentencing for such offences.
	
	
	With regard to the offence concerning the carrying of a firearm with disregard for the safety of himself and others it may be noted that the offender did not have the firearm in his possession for sinister purposes.
	
	
	I could have my suspicions about that but there is no suggestion in the evidence that he kept the firearm for a lengthy period of time with a plan, for example, to commit a particular crime.
	
	
	I accept that that is the case, notwithstanding his background of antisocial behaviour. But the facts are that the offender had the firearm in his possession illegally for about five years on his version and he also had in his possession ammunition that could be used in the firearm and which ultimately caused the serious harm to the victim I have described.
	
	
	It could be said this was not a transient offence, nor an opportunistic offence, but was an offence that was a culmination of what might be described as continuing illegal conduct.
	
	
	Even accepting the offender’s version of events, which I ultimately must in the absence of other evidence, that he found the firearm, put it away and forgot about it for a period of time, he had absolutely no right to have it in the first place, no right to continue to possess it, no right once he had rediscovered it to take it out, to show it to people, to arm it and to produce it in such dangerous circumstances as arose in this particular case.
	
	
	Ultimately, I have concluded that the principal offence is not the worst case committed by the worst offender but it is a very serious offence of its type given the character of the recklessness and the catastrophic effects and consequences of that recklessness.
	
	
	Further, the firearm offence, if I might call it that, the Sequence 2 offence, is a very serious offence of its type, being one that reflects not momentary criminality but, as I said earlier, the culmination of continuing criminality.
	
	
	The legislature has made it very clear that the possession and use of firearms is to be seriously regarded and this has been reflected by increased maximum penalties over recent years.
	
	
	The reasons for this are reflected very much in the facts of this case and the consequences of the continuing actions of the offender. If the firearm had been handed in by the offender, he having no right to possess it, these tragic events would not have occurred.
	
	
	In this context are to be considered, of course, the purposes of sentencing pursuant to s 3A and in that regard I am required to consider some matters that arise from the medical evidence and particularly the psychological evidence in the presentence report.
	
	
	The purposes of sentencing that obviously have relevance to this matter are the need to adequately punish the offender, to prevent him and others from committing similar offences, to protect the community from the offender, to promote his rehabilitation, to make him accountable for his actions, to denounce his conduct and to recognise the harm he had done to the victim.
	
	
	All those matters, to varying extents, have relevance in this matter, being matters identified as to be taken into account pursuant to s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
	
	
	It was submitted on behalf of the offender that less weight might be given to general deterrence by having regard to the “diagnosis” of Dr Jacmon. Whilst I have no doubt of Dr Jacmon’s considerable skills as a psychologist, his report is extensive and thorough, ultimately there are two features of that report.
	
	
	I accept that he has assessed certain symptoms consistent with particular conditions, but he is not a medical practitioner. I have no psychiatric evidence.
	
	
	Secondly, whilst the offender has had treatment in relation to supposed psychiatric matters and is being given medication consistent with the existence of certain conditions whilst in custody, which have a positive effect, there is no other evidence of the offender’s treatment outside of custody, nor is there any evidence of the offender’s willingness whilst at large to engage in treatment when the opportunities have arisen.
	
	
	The submissions were made to the Court that I should have regard to what were described as principles enunciated in the decision of De La Rosa.
	
	
	In that decision the learned Chief Judge at Common Law of the Supreme Court, Justice McClellan, as Justice Sperling had done earlier in the decision of Hemsley in 2004, sought to summarise many authorities that deal with the treatment of a prisoner where mental illness or disability is present in a particular case to a particular extent, whether causally connected to the offending or relevant only as a subjective matter, or both.
	
	
	He summarised one aspect of the matter, and this is what is relied upon by the accused and I am prepared to accept it, in the following terms; where the state of a person’s mental health contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Consequently the need to denounce the crime may be reduced.
	
	
	Further, it may also have the consequence that the offender is an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, resulting in a reduction in the sentence which would otherwise have been imposed.
	
	
	It may also mean that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on the person because the sentence will be more onerous for that person, the length of the prison term or the conditions under which it is served may be reduced.
	
	
	It may further reduce or eliminate the significance of specific deterrence, conversely, it may be that because of a person’s mental illness they may present more of a danger to the community. In those circumstances considerations of specific deterrence may result in an increased sentence.
	
	
	Of course his Honour stressed that a mental illness or mental health problems may not necessarily amount to a “serious psychiatric illness” before they will be relevant to the sentencing process.
	
	
	Even accepting Dr Jacmon’s findings, not seeing them so much as a diagnosis but a finding of the presence of particular symptoms particularly consistent with bipolar disorder and other related conditions to which he has referred, and even accepting that his bipolar condition may have, if it existed, contributed to his determination to possess the firearm over a period of time, it is also be borne in mind that he has what I have already referred to as ‘antisocial personality’ traits, which are reflected in his criminal history. That might also explain this conduct.
	
	
	There is, however, nothing in the evidence to suggest that his production of the firearm at risk to the victim and others including himself was in the course of an act of self destruction or a manic state or related in any way to a depressive condition.
	
	
	It may be that his excessive drinking was related to these matters and it may be that thus there is an indirect connection with the events in question but there is no direct causal connection.
	
	
	Even if such a casual connection could be found on the evidence reflected in the statement of facts and the psychologist’s opinion and the offender’s evidence in the context of the offender’s criminal history, and even accepting that he may have been undiagnosed or untreated at the relevant time, it does give rise to the consideration of the matter adverted to by Justice McClellan and also referred to by Chief Justice Gleeson in Engert where, to paraphrase their Honours’ more eloquent expression of it, where there is a proven causal connection between a mental illness and disability and offending, whilst it may require less weight to be given to general deterrence, it may require greater weight being given to personal deterrence or specific deterrence and consideration of the protection of the community.
	
	
	This in fact was the very essence of the sentencing exercise involved on the second occasion where Robert Vincent Veen was convicted of manslaughter and his matter was determined by the High Court in 1988.
	
	
	There is also nothing in the evidence so far as the mental state of the offender at the present time which suggests that there are any specific hardships in custody by reason of that fact. In fact, as I understand it, the offender is compliant with his medication and it has been positive for him.
	
	
	Of course the assessment of Dr Jacmon is relevant in this matter, but not so much in the context of the assessment of principles enunciated in De La Rosa relating to the assessment of the purposes of sentencing reflecting upon the moral culpability of the prisoner or the objective criminality, but more relevant to the assessment of the issue of “special circumstances” pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and thus the determination of the non-parole period.
	
	
	With regard to the Form 1 matter, I appreciate that the cultivation of Indian hemp plants was, on the offender’s account, for personal use. There was some professionalism in the cultivation, as I have noted from the facts, but that is not necessarily inconsistent with the personal use of the plants.
	
	
	I note his cannabis dependence has been a factor in his offending over a period of time, as has his alcohol dependence but he has not sought really to seriously address these matters before these calamitous events.
	
	
	There is also little evidence in this matter that the cannabis played any role in the commission of the principal offence and when the offender did give evidence he referred more to the ingestion of beer rather than the use of cannabis as affecting him.
	
	
	Obviously the Form 1 matter has a diminished salience of the sentencing proceedings for the reasons I have outlined from the guideline judgment.
	
	
	I am required, of course, to have regard to the standard non-parole period for the offence of recklessly inflicting grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The proper approach to this matter as summarised, from the decision of Muldrock v The Queen (2011) 244 CLR 120, is that it is essential to recognise that the fixing of the non-parole period is only one part of the larger task of passing sentence. Fixing the appropriate non parole period is not to be treated as if it was a necessary starting point or the only important end point in framing a sentence to which Division 1A of Pt 4 applies.
	
	
	The legislation requires an approach to sentencing where standard non parole periods apply that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by Justice McHugh in Markarian (2005) 228 CLR 537, particularly at [51], where the Judge is required to identify all relevant factors to the sentencing procedure and give them such weight as is appropriate in the case.
	
	
	The Court is obliged to have regard to the full range of factors in relation to the determination of the appropriate sentence. In that regard the Court is mindful of two legislative guide posts, the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period.
	
	
	The latter requires that content be given to its specification as the non parole period for an offence in the middle range of objective seriousness, meaningful content cannot be given to the concept of taking into account characteristics of the offender, the objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or a class of offenders. It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending, then the court is required to assess relevant matters that are subjective matters.
	
	
	The Court is required ultimately to identify all the relevant facts of the matters of the circumstance which the judge concludes bear upon the judgment required. This obligation applies in relation to offences with a standard non-parole period regardless of whether the offender has been committed after trial, or whether the offence might be characterised as low, middle or high range of objective seriousness of such offences (see [17] - [29]).
	
	
	With regard to the relevant consideration of s 21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act in this matter, as I am required to do, noting the terms of (1) of that section and the requirement of consideration of matters under (2) and (3) as additional matters to those otherwise able to be concluded from the facts and the pleadings. It is the case, as was conceded in submissions, that an aggravating additional factor in this matter, in relation to the reckless infliction of grievous bodily harm, was the actual use of a weapon.
	
	
	It might be implied that that would be so, given that grievous bodily harm was inflicted, but the character of the weapon in this matter is to be so regarded as an additional aggravating factor.
	
	
	Of course, it is to be borne in mind that the use of the weapon is in a general sense an element of the related offence for which a sentence must be imposed which will be partly concurrent and accumulative of the principal offence as the pleadings of that matter made clear.
	
	
	A further aggravating factor in relation to the offence of recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm was that it was an offence committed without regard for public safety. Again, that is self-evidently a key characteristic of the related offence, to which I have just referred, given the pleading in it.
	
	
	The Crown submitted that the infliction of substantial bodily harm of the victim was an additional aggravating factor. I cannot accept this submission because the infliction of grievous bodily harm is a relevant element of the offence, as earlier discussed with the learned Crown Prosecutor, whose submissions were, of course, most helpful in the determination of this matter.
	
	
	It is to be borne in mind that s 21A(2) provides that the Court is “not to have additional regard to any such aggravation in sentencing if it is an element of the offence.” The pleading of the infliction of grievous bodily harm would, clearly in my view, include the infliction of substantial bodily harm.
	
	
	Although the criminal history of the offender does not entitle him to any leniency I cannot adopt the submission of his counsel that it is an aggravating factor in this matter.
	
	
	With regard to mitigating factors I accept that the offences were not “planned”. Naturally, having regard to the psychological report and the guarded prognosis of the offender and his past performance as revealed in his criminal history, I could not conclude that the offender is unlikely to re-offend or has good prospects of rehabilitation.
	
	
	I am, however, satisfied that the offender has shown remorse by accepting responsibility for his actions. This is acknowledged in a range of ways, firstly although he fled the scene with the other friends of the victim, by ringing the ambulance, apparently he was close by. He revealed the whereabouts of the firearm as best he understood them, he was not the person who hid the firearm, I have no reason to understand why the victim’s other friend hid the firearm, but that is precisely what he did.
	
	
	The offender gave evidence of accepting responsibility for his actions. He pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity and has expressed his remorse to the Probation and Parole Service and the psychologist.
	
	
	There is no suggestion in the offender’s evidence or the facts of the case that the offender was not fully aware of the consequences of his actions because of his age or any disability.
	
	
	The plea of guilty is of course a mitigating factor, however the offender also receives the discount to which I have referred, following upon the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton, which in fact compels me to give him a 25% discount upon the otherwise appropriate sentence.
	
	
	I am also of the view that the offender has provided assistance to the law enforcement authorities in the investigation of this matter as revealed in the facts. Although he and the others fled the scene after the victim was initially injured, it seems that this was more a reaction of panic than any deliberation.
	
	
	He had the presence of mind to ring triple-0 and assist in other ways. Of course, it would have been better to have remained to assist directly. The facts are somewhat confusing in this regard because it seems as though the victim was assisted down the stairs by someone to be taken to the ambulance at a later time. It must be also said that what did occur for all concerned, including of course the victim, was unforeseen, sudden and shocking.
	
	
	I notice I said earlier that it was not just the offender who fled but the victim’s other friends, who bore no criminal responsibility, as I understand it, for the conduct of the offender.
	
	
	I have already adverted to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have determined that there are special circumstances. The law requires me to take into account first of all the effect of partial accumulation, that is a special circumstance that will require an adjustment of the non-parole period for the accumulative sentence and the accumulative sentence in this matter will be for the more serious offence, the infliction of grievous bodily harm.
	
	
	The other special circumstances in this matter, bearing in mind the previous times the offender has had in custody and other matters that have arisen in the case, are the need for the offender to have professional assistance to adjust to community living, the need for an extended period of supervision to address the matters identified in the Probation and Parole Service report and in Dr Jacmon’s report.
	
	
	Ultimately the non-parole period effectively imposed for the offender represents approximately 66% of the total sentence, if special circumstances other than accumulation were not found the non-parole period would represent 75% of the total sentence.
	
	
	The adjustment is modest but in my view sufficiently reflects the matters that are to be taken into account in making that finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
	
	
	I trust that I have addressed all the matters, as anyone who has sat here to listen to what I have had to say about the matter, including the offender, would now understand, the sentencing of offenders is not a simple exercise undertaken by throwing darts at a dart board or tossing dice on the ground and coming up with a number that first appeals.
	
	
	One is required to weigh up a range of matters, the interests of the victim, the interests of the community, and of course the interests of the offender in the sense of endeavouring in some way to see that on the service of the sentence that when the offender returns to the community, as he must, the offender is in a better position to avoid offending as he did on this occasion and in the past, and as he was on that fateful morning of 20 October 2012 when the victim was so grievously wounded.
	
	
	Could you stand up, thank you very much, Mr Pound. In relation to the Sequence 2 offence, that is the offence I have referred to shortly as carrying a firearm with disregard for the safety of yourself and others you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years six months. That will date from 26 October 2012 and expire, on my calculation, on 25 April 2016.
	
	
	In relation to the Sequence 1 offence, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, you are convicted. You are sentenced to a term of imprisonment by way of non-parole period of three and a half years to date from 26 April 2014. That non-parole period, on my calculation, should expire on 25 October 2017.
	
	
	In relation to that sentence I fix a balance of sentence of two and-a-half years imprisonment, the two and a half years imprisonment will expire on 26 April 2020.
	
	
	The total sentence is a sentence of seven and a half years imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years.
	
	
	You can sit down now, thank you, sir.
	
	
	Your counsel submitted, no doubt optimistically, that I might consider a suspended sentence, but you appreciate the totality of the criminality in this matter could not permit a sentence of two years or less.
	
	
	I have had regard, of course, to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, no other sentence other than a term of imprisonment can be imposed for this matter.
	
	
	Yes, Madam Crown, are there any technical or other matters that need correcting? Apart from my judgment?
	
	
	OWENS: Just to confirm, your Honour, that in imposing that sentence for Sequence 1, the reckless grievous bodily harm, that the Form 1 matter has been taken into account?
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: I said that. I know, in fact I know I specifically said that. Yes. It is and it has been, yes, thank you.
	
	
	WASSEF: Nothing arising, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right. And no issue as to dates, Madam Crown, as far as you can best calculate?
	
	
	OWENS: No, your Honour.
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: Right, thank you very much. And Mr Pound, do you understand the sentence that’s been imposed?
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.  
	
	
	HIS HONOUR: You'll be eligible for release to parole on 25 October 2017.  I can't direct that you'll be released to parole, that'll be a matter for the Parole Authority and that will include a consideration of all your circumstances at that particular time.  
	
	
	OFFENDER: Yes.

		21 April 2015",2013-11-12 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705881,R v Hunter [2013] NSWSC 1713,"Judgment

1JOHNSON J: The Accused, Paul Andrew Hunter, is charged with the murder of Jason Dixon at Dharruk on 23 June 2011. 

The Present Application

2The trial of the Accused was fixed to commence on 4 November 2013. On 28 October 2013, on the application of the Accused, I varied the trial listing by fixing for hearing on 7 and 8 November 2013 a Notice of Motion seeking the exclusion of certain evidence, with the trial to commence before a jury on 11 November 2013. 

3By Notice of Motion filed on 6 November 2013, the Accused applied to vacate the jury trial then fixed for 11 November 2013. The vacation application proceeded to a hearing on 8 November 2013. 

4At the conclusion of that hearing, I made an order vacating the trial and stated that I would give reasons for this decision on 13 November 2013. This judgment contains my reasons for vacating the trial. 

Background to Application

5A chronology of events is required to place this application into context. 

6On 20 October 2011, the Accused was charged with the murder of Jason Dixon. 

7Committal proceedings took place on dates between November 2012 and January 2013, with the Accused being committed from the Parramatta Local Court on 21 January 2013 for trial in this Court. A Public Defender acted for the Accused at the committal proceedings.

8The Accused first appeared before this Court on 1 March 2013. 

9The Court has been informed that Ms Danieli, solicitor, was instructed on 15 March 2013 to act for the Accused on a legally aided basis.

10On 5 April 2013, Ms Danieli appeared before Latham J in the Arraignments List and indicated that counsel had not yet been retained. The matter was adjourned to 3 May 2013. 

11Counsel from the private Bar was briefed to appear at the trial. The Court does not know why a Public Defender was not briefed as trial counsel.

12On 3 May 2013, counsel then appearing for the Accused appeared before Latham J in the Arraignments List, and a trial date of 4 November 2013 was fixed with a two-week estimate. 

13I pause to observe that the present proceedings are governed by the case management provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 as enacted by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Case Management) Act 2009 (""the 2009 Amending Act""): Clause 79(2), Sch 2, Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The case management regime enacted by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Mandatory Pre-Trial Defence Disclosure) Act 2013 (""the 2013 Amending Act"") applies only in respect of proceedings in which the indictment was presented or filed on or after 1 September 2013: Clause 79(1), Sch 2, Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

14Accordingly, Supreme Court Practice Note SC CL 2 (issued on 13 August 2010) (""the 2010 Practice Note"") applies to this case. Supreme Court Practice Note SC CL 2 (issued on 20 September 2013) (""the 2013 Practice Note"") relates to proceedings caught by the 2013 Amending Act.

15The Crown filed a Notice of the Prosecution Case for the purpose of s.137 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 on 23 September 2013. 

16The defence was required to respond to the prosecution notice in compliance with s.138 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, no later than four weeks before the trial date: Clause 10, 2010 Practice Note. 

17Clause 12 of the 2010 Practice Note stated:

""By the date set for the trial, the matter must be ready to proceed. If there is an unavoidable problem or change to the conduct or length of the trial, legal practitioners are to notify the criminal registry or the criminal list judge at the earliest possible stage to avoid inconvenience to jurors and witnesses.

An application to vacate a trial date is to be made by way of Notice of Motion with a supporting affidavit, setting out the grounds for the application.""

18In circumstances revealed in my judgment of 15 October 2013 (refusing an earlier application to vacate the trial date), Ms Danieli was informed on 2 October 2013 that it would be necessary for her to brief other counsel as the selected counsel was not a member of the Legal Aid NSW Specialist Barrister Panel (Complex Criminal Law). 

19On 9 October 2013, Ms Danieli briefed Mr Carroll of counsel who accepted the brief.

20As already mentioned, on 15 October 2013, I refused to vacate the trial, fixing the matter for further mention on 28 October 2013, in advance of the trial fixed for 4 November 2013. That application to vacate was based upon the Accused's concern that there may not be time for new counsel to prepare for trial. It was not submitted on that application that the counsel and solicitor for the Accused did not consider there was time to prepare for trial.

21By 28 October 2013, a Notice of Defence Response had not been provided to the Crown in accordance with s.138 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 

22On 28 October 2013, Mr Carroll appeared on the mention of the trial and indicated that he was required to appear for an accused at a trial at the Parramatta District Court, where the jury had been discharged and where the trial was to commence again that afternoon. 

23On that day, a defence Notice of Motion was filed indicating three areas of evidence which were sought to be excluded. 

24Not without some misgivings, I agreed to defer the commencement of the trial, with the jury panel to attend on 11 November 2013 for the trial proper to commence. To meet the convenience of defence counsel, I listed the pre-trial application in the Notice of Motion for hearing on 7 and 8 November 2013.

25After it had been confirmed that day that no s.138 Defence Notice had been served on the Crown, I made clear that such a notice was to be provided.

26There was no mention on 28 October 2013 (or before then) that any issue of substantial mental impairment may arise in this trial. In an attempt to understand the trial issues, I enquired of counsel whether there would be any expert evidence adduced in the defence case and he replied, ""There may be"" (T6.3, 28 October 2013). 

27Counsel indicated that contact had been made with a neurologist for advice to be provided concerning the possible impact upon the Accused's cognitive function, as a result of a blow to the head which (it was common ground) had occurred on the afternoon that the Accused allegedly murdered the deceased. It was the Crown case that the deceased had struck the Accused to the head earlier that day and that the events giving rise to the murder charge were said to have involved an act of revenge for the earlier incident.

28Defence counsel sought leave to issue a subpoena directed to Justice Health, to obtain records concerning the treatment of the Accused in custody. I abridged time for issue of such a subpoena, made returnable before me on 1 November 2013.

29On 1 November 2013, on the return of subpoena directed to Justice Health, Ms Danieli handed up in Court (and provided to the Crown) a s.138 Notice. The document was singularly uninformative. Apart from identification of Mr Carroll as trial counsel instructed by Ms Danieli, the notice stated:

""The issue as to substantial impairment is currently being investigated. The defence is not in a position to file a notice at this stage.""

30I stood the matter over to 6 November 2013, on which occasion Ms Danieli sought leave to file in Court the Notice of Motion seeking to vacate the trial date, supported by an affidavit sworn by herself on 5 November 2013. Annexed to the affidavit was a short report of Dr Peter Ashkar, psychologist, who suggested various lines of investigation with respect to the Accused.

Substantial Mental Impairment

31I pause at this stage to make a number of observations. 

32If an accused person intends to adduce evidence of substantial mental impairment at a trial for murder, the Accused cannot do so without the leave of the Court, unless notice has been given to the Crown at least 35 days before the commencement date of the trial: s.151(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986; Clause 20 Criminal Procedure Regulation 2010. 

33This Court should be entitled to approach listed murder trials upon the basis that the legal representatives instructed on the trial will have turned their minds to a possible issue of substantial mental impairment before a trial date is fixed. Information of this type is essential for the purpose of identifying the issues at trial, and providing an accurate estimate for the duration of the trial. 

34In any event, if substantial mental impairment is to be raised, there is a statutory requirement for notice. It has been accepted that a flexible approach ought be taken by the Court where leave is sought under s.151, to rely upon the partial defence of substantial mental impairment after the time prescribed by statute: R v Kaewklom (No. 1) [2012] NSWSC 1103 at [29]-[30]. 

35This does not mean, however, that the legal representatives for an accused person may delay such a process, in the expectation that leave will always be granted, or that a trial date will be vacated where a belated suggestion is made that substantial mental impairment is being explored.

Some Factual Matters

36It is appropriate to refer briefly to some factual matters. It has always been part of the Crown case, communicated to the legal representatives for the Accused, that the deceased, on the afternoon of 20 June 2011, hit the Accused on the back of the head with an implement, thereby causing the Accused to make verbal threats to the deceased.

37It is the Crown case that the Accused later that day entered the premises of the deceased, in the company of others, where the deceased was struck to the head with fatal consequences. 

38The Crown case against the Accused is put on two alternative bases, namely, that the Accused is guilty by reason of his own act in striking the deceased in his house, or that he is guilty by reason of having acted in concert with his brother and cousin, Wade Hunter and Gary Hunter (who are said to have been present), to at least intentionally inflict grievous bodily harm on the deceased, in retribution for the deceased's earlier assault on the Accused.

39There is some material in the statements of Crown witnesses that indicate that the Accused had been consuming alcohol and/or drugs on that day. There is material, as well, which indicates that the Accused attended the Mt Druitt Hospital on the evening of 20 June 2011, where he was seen by nursing staff. A lump was observed on the head of the Accused, but no blood was seen. The Accused did not remain to be examined by a medical practitioner.

40The Crown brief contains a statement from Michael Fanous, a pharmacist, who states that at about 5.50 pm that day, the Accused attended his pharmacy and was administered his methadone dose for that day. Mr Fanous observed that the Accused was moving somewhat slowly. On arrival later at Mt Druitt Hospital, the Accused appeared unsteady on his feet and was stumbling.

The Basis of the Application

41The thrust of the application to vacate the trial date was that the legal representatives for the Accused needed an opportunity to explore the possibility of a partial defence of substantial mental impairment, arising from a possible head injury to the Accused sustained on 20 June 2011 in combination with the impact of drug and alcohol consumption that day. 

42Reliance was placed as well upon an entry in the Accused's Justice Health records which indicate that, whilst he was in custody at an earlier time (on 2 May 2001), a booking had been made for him to attend Westmead Hospital for a CT scan which appeared to relate to the Accused's head. The Justice Health records did not disclose the results of this CT scan. 

43In addition, the Justice Health clinical notes record the Accused, on 26 February 2012, complaining of headaches and slightly blurry vision. A nurse noted a lump on the head of the Accused.

44Mr Carroll submitted that the scenario which might present itself in this case may have certain similarities to that referred to by Fullerton J in R v Kennedy [2008] NSWSC 703, in particular at [31]ff. 

45In support of the application, it was submitted that the blow to the head of the Accused and evidence concerning his apparent intoxication by alcohol and/or drugs, would be important issues in the trial. It was submitted that the defence wished to have further investigations carried out of a neurological type, to determine whether there is evidence of any neurological injury which may bear upon the state of the Accused on 20 June 2011.

46The affidavit of Ms Danieli sworn 6 November 2013 reveals that the Accused admits to being present when the deceased was struck to the head, but the Accused says that the blows were delivered by his now deceased brother, Wade Hunter. 

47The legal representatives for the Accused made arrangements for Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, to examine the Accused on 7 November 2013. The Court was informed that Dr Nielssen had provided a report to the legal representatives for the Accused which indicated that substantial mental impairment (on psychiatric grounds) was not available to the Accused. Dr Nielssen's report has not been served on the Crown or provided to the Court.

48The Crown noted that it had prepared for a trial upon a basis different to that now raised for the Accused. If the Accused sought to raise the blow to his head and consumption of alcohol and/or drugs as trial issues, then the Crown may not be in a position to meet them at this time.

Determination of Application

49I was and remain concerned at the way in which this application unfolded. The factual matters relied upon are all contained in the prosecution brief, with the additional reference in the Justice Health records to a proposed CT scan in 2001, and certain matters raised by the Accused on 26 February 2012 (having apparently been in custody on other matters since 21 June 2011). Apart from that, Dr Ashkar (who has not examined the Accused) has raised a number of suggestions for enquiry, from a psychological perspective. As I have said, Dr Nielssen does not support a partial defence of substantial mental impairment.

50I have kept in mind, as well, that this is not a case, such as R v Kennedy, where the Accused admits that he struck the fatal blow to the head of the deceased. This places some distance between the Accused and the normal scenario where substantial mental impairment is raised. Mr Carroll submits that substantial mental impairment may arise, as well, in a scenario such as this. 

51I have significant misgivings as to whether the delay in the trial will furnish any further evidence which may bear upon the guilt of the Accused. However, the Accused is to stand trial for murder. Where application is made to adjourn a trial upon the basis that the defence seeks to explore an issue which may constitute a defence or partial defence at trial, then the Court should adopt a cautious approach before shutting the Accused out from taking those steps. It has been said that an accused should be given a reasonable chance to present his case, which necessarily includes a reasonable opportunity to prepare that case before being called upon to present it: R v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 289.

52At the same time, as also acknowledged in R v Alexandroaia at 291, there is a strong public interest in a criminal trial, once fixed for hearing upon the basis that the parties were ready to proceed, ordinarily proceeding with expedition. The Court of Criminal Appeal has observed that the significance of this consideration (expressed in R v Alexandroaia in 1995) has been reinforced by the case management provisions contained in the 2009 Amending Act: Slotboom v R [2013] NSWCCA 18 at [36].

53I am conscious that a last-minute application to vacate a trial date will have a likely adverse effect upon witnesses in the trial, and persons interested in the trial, including the family of the deceased. I am conscious, as well, of the disruptive effect upon the Court's administrative arrangements where a trial is vacated at the last minute, in the manner in which has occurred in this case. This is not a course to be taken lightly. 

54However, In all the circumstances, I formed the view that the appropriate order was to vacate the trial date and an order to that effect was made on 8 November 2013. 

55Before concluding this judgment, I wish to make two observations. Firstly, as I have noted, this trial is not caught by the recent provisions for mandatory defence disclosure contained in the 2013 Amending Act. Implementation of those provisions should guard against repetition of what has happened in this case. That said, this trial was subject to the case-management provisions enacted by the 2009 Amending Act. Defence compliance with those provisions, and the statutory requirement for notice where substantial mental impairment may be raised, should have seen this issue being explored by the legal representatives for the Accused at a much earlier time. 

56Secondly, the fact that the Court made an order vacating the trial should not be interpreted as the Court desiring or requesting that the further enquiries foreshadowed by the legal representatives for the Accused should be undertaken. All the Court has done is provide time for this issue to be considered, by vacating the trial date. 

57Following the pre-trial hearing which is to proceed today, I will make an order placing the proceedings in the next Arraignments List on 6 December 2013.

		03 September 2014",2013-11-12 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court
2705885,R v Krbavac [2013] NSWSC 1671,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Anthony Vjekoslav Krbavac is charged with the murder of his uncle Ervin Krbavac on 27 March 2012 at Auburn in the State of New South Wales. 

2On 8 April 2013, I found the accused unfit to be tried and referred him to the Mental Health Review Tribunal ('the Tribunal') in accordance with s 14(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (the Act): R v Krbavac [2013] NSWSC 313. 

3On 16 May 2013, the Tribunal formed the opinion that the accused has not become fit to be tried for the offence of murder and determined that he, on the balance of probabilities, will not, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for that offence. 

4The Director of Public Prosecutions in a letter dated 25 July 2013 to the Registrar of this Court advised that he intended to proceed with the charge of murder against the accused and sought a special hearing. 



5A special hearing is defined in s 19(2) of the Act as:

""... a hearing for the purpose of ensuring, despite the unfitness of the person to be tried in accordance with the normal procedures, that the person is acquitted unless it can be proved to the requisite criminal standard of proof that, on the limited evidence available, the person committed the offence charged or any other offence available as an alternative to the offence charged.""

6Section 21(1) of the Act provides that except as provided by the Act, ""a special hearing is to be conducted as nearly as possible as if it were a trial of criminal proceedings."" My determination must include the principles of law applied by me and the findings of fact upon which I rely: s 21B(2) of the Act. 

7During the special hearing, Mr P Lynch appeared for the Crown and Ms J Manuell SC for the accused. There has been no dispute between the parties about the facts established by the evidence and the opinions expressed by the three psychiatrists. Both Mr Crown and Ms Manuell submitted that a special verdict of not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness pursuant to s 38 of the Act was appropriate in all the circumstances of this case. 

Legal principle 

8In deciding whether a special verdict should be entered, I am not required to decide whether the requisite intent for the offence of murder, that is in this case an intention to kill has been proved. That question only arises if I do not find that the defence of mental illness is established: Hawkins v The Queen [1994] HCA 28; (1994) 179 CLR 500 at 517; R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; (2005) 63 NSWLR 490 per Hunt AJA at [32].

9The Crown, however, must prove beyond reasonable doubt that it was a deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased. An act is not deliberate if it was not voluntary that is, not willed by the accused. 

The Crown case 

10The special hearing has proceeded by way of the tender of witness statements, Dr Szentmariay's autopsy report, photographs of the crime scene and the reports of psychiatrists. Detective Sergeant Winch and Dr Nielssen gave oral evidence. The accused's ERISP interview with police on 27 March 2012 was played to the Court. 

11I will refer to some of the witness statements as succinctly as possible. The accused was the nephew of the deceased (the accused's father and the deceased were brothers). The accused lived with his parents at xxxx xxxxx Auburn and the deceased lived nearby with his wife at xxxx xxxxx Street. The two families were very close and saw each other frequently. 

12Shortly after 1pm on Tuesday 27 March 2012, Carolyn Newton who was sitting on the verandah of her home in xxxxxxx Auburn saw a young male and their next door neighbour who she knew as ""Eddie"" standing on the verandah of xxxxxxxxxxxx Street. Mrs Newton saw what appeared to be blood spatter on both the young male's face and Eddie's face. She recounted that there was more blood on Eddie's face than the young males. About a minute later, Mrs Newton saw Eddie collapse to the ground. Mrs Newton's husband then rang police. 

13Constable Polley with Constable Ghoriani arrived at xxxxx Street at about 1:38pm. The accused was covered in blood from the top of his head to his shoes. He had a claw hammer with a wooden handle in his hand with blood all over it. When Detective Sergeant Leis arrived, he cautioned the accused and then asked him a number of questions. The conversation was recorded by a handheld device. 

14During the conversation, the accused admitted hitting his uncle with the hammer a number of times. 

15Police found the deceased near the front porch. He was not moving and there were a number of open wounds to his skull. He was taken by ambulance to Westmead Hospital where he died soon afterwards. 

16The accused was conveyed to Auburn Police Station where he entered into an ERISP interview that was conducted by Detective Sergeant Leis with Detective Sergeant Winch. During the interview, the accused made admissions about the death. 

17Shortly stated, the evidence establishes that some time before 27 March 2012, the accused went to the deceased's residence with a hand written letter addressed to the deceased and his wife Grace, threatening to hit them on the head with a hammer (ex E TB 10). 

18The deceased gave the letter to the accused's mother. The letter was subsequently brought to the attention of the accused's mental health case worker and Dr Cottrell-Dormer, his treating psychiatrist. Dr Cottrell-Dormer's statement discloses that a clinical decision was proposed to attempt to manage the accused in the community. This was to entail close involvement of the case manager, but prompt admission to hospital would follow should the case manager or family feel it was necessary in the case of any further concern. A review date was set for three weeks with the understanding that the accused would be seen earlier if necessary. The accused's medication was changed to 150mg of ""paliperidone"" injection, to be given monthly (ex E TB 21 p 3). 

19Early in the morning of 27 March 2012, the accused took a hammer from his father's car without the knowledge of his parents. The accused's parents left home some time later that morning to visit a relative. After they were gone, the accused armed with the hammer walked to the deceased's home. The deceased was working in the bathroom on the ground floor of his house. He was home alone as his wife had gone to purchase bathroom tiles. The accused walked into the house through a closed (but not locked) screen door and an open glass door. He saw the deceased and immediately began to inflict hammer blows to the deceased's head. The deceased tried to fight off the accused and the ensuing struggle led down the hallway, to the outside of the house. The deceased fell to the ground and the accused continued to inflict hammer blows. As I have previously recounted, the police were called and the accused was arrested. 

20Dr Istvan Szentmariay, a forensic pathologist, conducted an autopsy on the body of the deceased. Post-mortem examination ""showed the presence of extensive blunt force injuries involving the front, top and the back of the head"" (ex E TB 16 p 3). Dr Szentmariay observed that ""[t]he injuries mostly consisted of slightly curved lacerations, many surrounded by varying sizes of abrasions. Underlying some of these injuries, patterned (occasionally) depressed fractures were noted. These injuries were most severe on the back of the head where the brain was exposed due to extensive fracturing of the skull"" (ex E TB 16 p 3). 

21The forensic pathologist concluded that ""[t]he deceased had been struck with a blunt object on the head which left multiple surface marks (on the skull) that seemed to represent the size and shape of a hammer head"" (ex E TB 16 p 3). Multiple blunt injuries, that is blows inflicted by the hammer, not only involved the back of the head and neck area but also the top of the head and the forehead and facial area. Dr Szentmariay found that the overall number of blows was in the vicinity of twenty. He determined that the direct cause of death was multiple blunt force head injuries. 

22Having regard to the evidence, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused deliberately struck the deceased multiple times on the head with the hammer which caused the deceased's death. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that these actions were willed by the accused and were voluntary. 

23I turn to the next question for consideration, which is whether the accused at the time of the stabbing was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law.

The defence of mental illness

24The accused bears the onus of proof, on the balance of probabilities, of establishing mental illness: Hawkins v The Queen. To establish that the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for his actions, the accused must show that as a result of a defect of reason from a disease of the mind he did not appreciate the nature and quality of the physical act of hitting his uncle on the head with the hammer or did not know what he was doing was wrong. 

25What then is meant by a disease of the mind which produces such a defect of reason? The law requires that the accused's state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition which may be temporary or longstanding, whether curable or incurable. A defect of reason, memory or understanding involves a disorder of the capacity to reason such as one that prevented the accused from knowing what he was doing, in that he did not know the physical nature or quality of the act or did not know that the act was wrong but wrong according to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community.

26In King v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182, Dixon J (as his Honour then was) in summing up said at p 189-190: 

""If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people."" 

The evidence of the psychiatrists 

27The accused who is 42 years old has a well documented history of chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia for which he has, over the last 16 years, been receiving treatment. Prior to the commission of the alleged offence, the accused has had admissions to Cumberland Hospital and case management together with treatment for a psychotic illness with antipsychotic medication. 

28In addition to the oral testimony of Dr Nielssen, there are two reports and an expert statement that discuss the defence of mental illness. Dr Furst prepared a report dated 28 April 2012. Dr Nielssen's report is dated 30 October 2012 and the expert statement from Dr Cottrell-Dormer is dated 3 July 2012.

29Dr Nielssen interviewed the accused on 25 October 2012 at the request of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Dr Nielssen diagnosed the accused with chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia, which was made on the basis of the history of constant hallucinations of voices, the corroborative information in the documents provided, including the ERISP, the accused's journal, and other psychiatric reports, and aspects of the accused's presentation, in particular, his disorganised thinking and bizarre explanation for his symptoms. Dr Nielssen opined (at ex E TB 22 p 7):

""Based on the information that was available to me and the findings of the recent interview, it is also my opinion that [the accused] has the defence of mental illness open to him for this charge. He has a well documented chronic schizophrenic illness, which produces a pattern of abnormality of mind that is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. 

Based on the account he gave in the interviews by the police and the medical assessors, and his written material, it is clear that he had a defect of reason in the form of the bizarre delusional belief that the voices that sounded like his father were also from God and the government, and which in an illogical way urged him to kill his uncle and aunt. He was probably aware of the physical nature and quality of his act in concealing the hammer and fatally assaulting his uncle. However, I believe that he was deprived of the ability to recognise that his actions were morally wrong, because of the interpretation of the situation arising from his delusional beliefs and the gross impairment in his capacity for logical thinking arising from his chronic mental illness.""

30During the ERISP interview, the accused made many references to hearing voices. During his oral evidence, Dr Nielssen said (T 12/11/13 p 13 L 45-50, p14 L 1-17):

""A. ...He described hallucinated voices and a very illogical interpretation of that experience in that he interpreted it to be the voice of his father and also the voice of God and that somehow that also included the authority of the government. It was quite a disorganized account on his part as to the origin of the voices he could hear. 

Q. And is it your view that the accused believed these voices had some authority over him? 
A. Yes. 

Q. And that he acted in accordance with the directions given by the voices? 
A. That's correct. 

Q. In this particular case there is evidence that well, you have seen or read the police interview. When he was interviewed by the police he indicated to them that he knew he would be at the police station. He knew he would be in police custody. And indeed, he told the police that he put car keys under the door because he knew that later he would be at the police station. Does that indicate that he had some appreciation of what he had planned was unlawful? 
A. Yes, I think he recognised in the sense that it was legally wrong. But it is my opinion that based on his delusional world view he did not see his actions as being morally wrong because he was being directed by, as a higher authority, the voice of God.""

31Dr Furst interviewed the accused at the request of the Legal Aid Commission on 29 March 2012. He noted the accused's lengthy history of mental illness, with ten previous admissions to Cumberland Hospital. He was admitted on two occasions in 2010, as he was fearful that he was going to die because ""voices"" said, ""Soon you will die"" (ex 1 p 2). The accused recalled that he had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and was treated with Risperidone Consta injections at a dose of 25mg monthly. 

32Dr Furst reported that the accused has been under the care of the Auburn Community Mental Health Team over several years, where his treating psychiatrist was Dr Cottrell-Dormer. There were persistent symptoms of psychosis, despite steady increases in the dose of his Risperidone Consta injections to 50mg every fortnight. In February 2012, his medication was changed to Paliperidone (Invega) injections at a dose of 150mg monthly. A review on 7 March 2012 indicated that the accused was ""suffering from 'painful dreams' and was hearing voices that told him to respect his mother and father, 'who made me'"" (ex 1 p 6). Dr Furst noted that the accused was thought to be suffering from ongoing florid symptoms of psychosis but was not an acute risk. 

33Dr Furst diagnosed the accused with chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The diagnosis was made on the accused's presentation, as he continued to suffer from symptoms of paranoia, auditory hallucinations and prominent thought disorder. Dr Furst was of the opinion that the accused remained acutely psychotic and lacked insight into his illness.

34On the issue of the defence of mental illness, Dr Furst writes (at ex 1 p 8):

""[the accused] presents as a 40-year-old male who has a lengthy history of severe and treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia and treatment through Cumberland Hospital and the Auburn Community Mental Health Service over the last 16 years. He was suffering from a relapse of his psychotic illness at the time in question before the Court, as there were detailed entries indicating a decline in his level of function and more prominent delusions and hallucinations. 

He appears to have developed a number of delusions that involved various family member[s], including his uncle and aunty, who he took to be evil. He also heard voices he believed were instructions from God about what he must do at the time of the killing. There was evidence of mood disturbance, thought disorder, and a lack of insight into his condition. He remained adamant he had done the right thing when I interviewed him on 29/03/12. 

In my opinion, [the accused] was laboring under a defect of reason in the form of paranoid and religiose delusions that involved his uncle and command auditory hallucinations. He suffers from severe treatment resistant schizophrenia, which has been recognised at law as a disease of the mind. He was aware of his actions but was unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense or composure. He appears to have the mental illness defence available to him."" 

35In a statement dated 3 July 2012, Dr Cottrell-Dormer, the accused's treating psychiatrist, states (at ex E TB 21 p 5): 

""With regard to [the accused's] likely state of mind at the time of the offence, my opinion is that it is reasonable to suppose that at the time of his alleged attack [the accused] was motivated by his delusions and hallucinations. These active symptoms of mental illness have remained as part of his daily life for many years, and have not been controlled by the medication or management undertaken with [the accused]; these active signs of [the accused's] mental illness were clearly and continuously evident throughout my experience of [the accused] as my patient from late 2006 until and including when reviewed two and seven weeks prior to the alleged homicide offence.""

And further (at ex E TB 21 p 5):

""If, as in my opinion it is most likely, this sort of abnormal system of thinking were present in [the accused] leading up to the alleged offence, then it would be consistent with my opinion that [the accused] was acting under the influence of a severe mental illness - active delusions and hallucinations - resulting in carrying out that alleged offence.""

36Dr Cottrell-Dormer had earlier in his statement provided a history of the consultations that the accused had with him. The last time Dr Cottrell-Dormer saw the accused he continued to exhibit active signs of mental illness. 

Determination

37Ms Manuell does not submit that the accused did not know the nature and quality of his acts. Ms Manuell contends that although the accused knew the nature and quality of his acts, he did not know what he was doing was wrong. In his closing address, Mr Crown conceded that the accused had established on the balance of probabilities the defence of mental illness. 

38All of the psychiatrists agree that at the time he killed the deceased, the accused was labouring under chronic treatment - resistant schizophrenia which is a disease of the mind. I accept the opinions of the psychiatrists that he did not know what he was doing was wrong. He had developed delusions that involved his uncle and aunty, who he took to be evil. He heard voices he believed were instructions from God about what he must do at the time of the killing. As Dr Nielssen said, he believed these voices had some authority over him and he acted in accordance with the directions given by the voices. I accept that he was unable to reason about the wrongfulness of his actions with a moderate degree of sense and composure. Having regard to the ordinary standards of reasonable people in our community, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that at the time he killed his uncle, the accused as a result of a defect of reason from a disease of the mind, did not know that what he was doing was wrong. The accused has established on the balance of probabilities the defence of mental illness. 

Explanation 

39I consider it is important to explain to the members of the deceased's family and the family of the accused who are present in Court the legal and practical consequences of my findings. 

40A special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness does not mean that the accused did not kill the deceased. I have found beyond reasonable doubt that he did so. The verdict means that, because of the severity of the mental illness from which the accused was suffering at the time he struck the deceased with the hammer, he is not to be held criminally responsible for his acts. Accordingly, I will not impose a sentence upon the accused. This verdict does not mean that the accused will be released. 

41The effect of the special verdict is that the accused will remain in detention and be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. The accused will not be released unless the Tribunal is satisfied that the safety of the accused or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by his release. 

42For the assistance of the Tribunal in its task, I bring to the Tribunal's attention the evidence before me that the accused went to his uncle's home with the intention of killing both his uncle and aunt: see in particular ERISP Q & A 170 ex E TB 8. The threats of violence in the letter (ex E TB 10) were directed not only at the deceased but also at his aunt. 

43Finally, may I acknowledge the grief and distress of Mrs Grace Krbavac and the deceased's family and express on the community's behalf its sympathy and compassion for them. 

Verdict 

44Pursuant to s 38 of the Act, I return a special verdict of not guilty on the ground of mental illness. 

Orders 

45I make the following orders:

1. Pursuant to s 39 of the Act, the accused is to be detained in the 
Forensic Hospital at Long Bay Correctional Centre or at such other place as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law. 

2. The Registrar is to notify the Minister for Health as soon as reasonably practicable of the terms of this judgment and the orders made by this Court. 

3. The Registrar is to notify the Mental Health Review Tribunal, as soon as reasonably practicable, of the terms of this judgment and the orders made by this Court. 

4. I direct the Court Registry to provide copies of the following documentation to the Mental Health Review Tribunal:

(a) this judgment;

(b) the transcript of the proceedings;

(c) the Crown tender bundle (ex E). 

(d) the reports of Dr Furst (ex 1 and 2).

2705895,R v Haines [2013] NSWSC 1609,"Judgment

1HIS HONOUR: Brenda Lee Haines, the accused, is charged with the murder of Haibo Wang on 3 March 2001 at Redfern. 

2It is the Crown case that on 3 March 2001 the accused had a confrontation with the deceased at his grocery shop. The accused was seen to be armed with a knife and standing over the deceased. The accused was observed leaving the scene with what appeared to be blood on her clothing. The deceased was conveyed to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where he was pronounced dead as a result of a stab wound to the chest. The accused was arrested. At the time of her arrest, blood stained clothing and shoes were recovered. A listening device that was placed in the accused's cell recorded her admissions to stabbing the deceased. 

3A question of the accused's fitness to be tried was raised and on 14 February 2003 the accused was found unfit to be tried and was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 

4On 8 June 2004, the accused was subject to a special hearing in which a jury determined that she had murdered the deceased. Miles AJ sentenced the accused to a limiting term of 17 years to commence on 3 March 2001 and to expire on 2 March 2018. 

5On 30 April 2013, the Mental Health Review Tribunal was of the opinion that, pursuant to s 47 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, the accused has become fit to be tried. 

6The Director of Public Prosecutions (the Director) has advised that further proceedings will be taken by the Director in respect of the murder and the court is obliged to hold a further inquiry as to the accused's fitness: 
s 29(1)(b) Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. Accordingly, pursuant to ss 8 and 10 of Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, Latham J has put the question of the accused's fitness to be tried before me. Section 11 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides that the question of a person's fitness to be tried for an offence is to be determined by a judge alone.

7The principles that apply in determining an accused's fitness to stand trial for State offences are well-settled. They are stated in R v Presser [1958] VR 45 by Smith J at [48]:

""[An accused] needs, I think, to be able to understand what it is that he is charged with. He needs to be able to plead to the charge and to exercise his right of challenge. He needs to understand generally the nature of the proceeding, namely, that it is an inquiry as to whether he did what he is charged with. He needs to be able to follow the course of the proceedings so as to understand what is going on in court in a general sense, though he need not, of course, understand the purpose of all the various court formalities. He needs to be able to understand, I think, the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against him; and he needs to be able to make his defence or answer to the charge. Where he has counsel he needs to be able to do this through his counsel by giving any necessary instructions and by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and, if necessary, telling the court what it is. He need not, of course, be conversant with court procedure and he need not have the mental capacity to make an able defence; but he must, I think, have sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence he will rely upon and to make his defence and his version of the facts known to the court and to his counsel, if any.""

8Presser has been approved by the High Court in Ngatayi v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 1 and Kesavarajah v The Queen [1994] HCA 41; (1994) 181 CLR 230. The length of the trial is also a relevant factor.

9The Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act governs the approach to be taken in a fitness inquiry for the offence. The Court is required to approach the inquiry in a non-adversarial manner and to determine the question of fitness on the balance of probabilities: ss 6, 11, and 12 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. Neither party bears the onus of proof. 

10Section 30 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act provides:

""(1) If, following a further inquiry under section 29, an accused person is found fit to be tried for an offence, the proceedings brought against the person in respect of the offence are to recommence or continue in accordance with the appropriate criminal procedures.

(2) If, following a further inquiry under section 29, an accused person is found unfit to be tried for an offence: 

(a) in the case of an accused person who has been detained in custody as an inmate (within the meaning of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999) or in a mental health facility as a forensic patient for a period or continuous periods in the aggregate of not less than 12 months and in respect of whom a special hearing has not been held-the Court must conduct a special hearing, or

(b) in the case of any other accused person-the Court may conduct a special hearing (if a special hearing has not been held) or order that the person be returned to the custody or mental health facility from which the person was taken.

(3) The Court must notify the Tribunal if it determines that a forensic patient detained in a mental health facility is fit to be tried for an offence.""

11Reports from psychiatrists have been tendered. I turn to that material.

12The accused who is 47 years old has been diganosed as suffering from schizoaffective disorder, alcohol abuse, and polysubstance dependence, antisocial, and borderline personality traits and developmental disability. 

13There are five reports that discuss the issue of fitness to stand trial. Dr Michael Giuffrida, a forensic psychiatrist, and Larissa Dodds, a clincial psychologist prepared a psychology report and Dr Giuffrida and Dr Martin Reading, a psychiatry registrar prepared a medical report. Both reports are dated 27 March 2013. Dr Stephen Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist, prepared a report dated 16 July 2013. Dr Giuffrida provided two supplementry reports dated 23 September 2013. 

14Dr Giuffrida and Ms Dodds conducted neuropsychological assessments to determine whether or not the accused was fit to plead. Whilst the accused's cognitive ability was considered to be well below average, they reported that there was no evidence to suggest that this should preclude her from being able to participate in the legal process provided that reasonable considerations be made. They opined: (ex D2 p 10):

"" Regarding the Presser Criteria, [the accused] has on a number of occasions, demonstrated the following: an understanding of the nature of her charge; an understanding of the plea options in relation to the charge, the importance of consulting her lawyer in this matter, as well as an opinion on the nature of her plea; and an ability to generally understand the nature of legal proceedings. With regards to [the accused's] ability to generally follow the proceedings of the court, given that the case related to the Index Event does not appear to be a complicated one, it is likely that she will be able to follow proceedings, again providing that reasonable considerations be made.
...
It is the opinion of the Treating Team that consideration be given to finding [the accused] fit to plead.""

15Dr Giuffrida and Dr Reading opined in their medical report: (ex D2 p 9): 

""It is clear that [the accused] is now in a position where she could effectively participate in a new trial if she were to be given the opportunity. She has made it very clear that she wants to go back to court and she is now very happy to participate. Furthermore, she has been able to demonstrate a sustained ability to discuss and talk about these matters over a period of time and on a number of different occasions.
...
The treating team find on the their assessment that [the accused] is currently fit to plead.

The evidence for this is based on a dramatic improvement in her mental state, that she now successfully meets all the Presser Criteria regarding fitness to plead and lastly, is at a point where it is reasonable to conclude she can effectively participate in the process of a trial were one to be held.""


16Dr Allnutt interviewed the accused on 10 July 2013 at the request of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Dr Allnutt has previously provided opinions on the accused; however, they are not before the me. On the issue of fitness, Dr Allnutt writes (ex F pp 3-4):

"" [The accused] has capacity to understand the nature of the charges - she understands that there is going to be a Court case about the alleged offending...

[The accused] understands the general nature of the proceedings - she understands the role of the lawyer, the prosecution, what evidence is, the role of the jury, the meaning of the terms guilty and not guilty and their consequences; she is capable of understanding the substantial effect of any evidence - she understands that evidence could be used for and against her; she has capacity to plead to the charge - she understands the meaning and consequences of the pleas of guilty and not guilty as well as not guilty by reason of mental illness; she has capacity to make her defence or answer to the charges - in my view with the assistance of counsel, she has capacity to provide a version and would be able to communicate this to counsel and to the Court and as a consequence of this decide on what defence she will rely upon...""

17Dr Allnutt queried the drowsiness that the accused experienced during his interview and formed the view that ""if her drowsiness is enduring secondary to medication... [it] raises the concern about her capacity to follow proceedings"" (ex F p 4). However, aside from his reservations regarding the accused's drowsiness, he believes that ""she has the cognitive capacity to stand trial"" (ex F p 4). 

18In light of Dr Allnutt's findings the Crown obtained an additional report from Dr Giuffrida dated 23 September 2013. Dr Giuffrida states (at ex G p 3):

""[The accused] is on Clozapine in a dose which for her clearly produces significant sedation particularly in the early part of the day and she is also on the mood stabiliser/anticonvulsant medication Sodium Valproate (Epilim) in a dose of 2,000mg a day which is a very substantial dose. Both of those medications therefore are likely to produce significant sedation and inevitably affect her concentration and attention span. For that reason her level of alertness and attention due to the side effects of those medications may be an issue in her capacity to follow proceedings at her trial.

I would suggest that a strategy to deal with this difficulty is that on the day or days of the trial on fitness that [the accused's] dose of Clozapine could be reduced. I expect that would increase her attention span and reduce any risk of sedation, I think that is a fairly safe thing to do for one to three days but not beyond that because of the risk of breakthrough symptoms...

I trust that will overcome the concern that Dr Allnutt has expressed..."" 

19Dr Giuffrida provided an additional report to the accused's solicitors dated 23 September 2013 in which he confirmed his opinion that the accused is fit to be tried and he stood by the reasons expressed in the joint report with Dr Reading dated 27 March 2013.

Conclusion

20The Presser criteria are to be considered in light of the complexity and the length of the accused's trial. The breaks that the accused will require due to any alertness or intelligence issues will need to be taken into account. The Crown and Mr Ierace SC for the accused estimate that the trial will take some two weeks. Both counsel agree that the factual issues in the trial are not complex.

21The Crown submits that the accused is fit to be tried. Mr Ierace does not oppose that submission. 

22It is the opinion of Dr Allnutt, subject to his reservation about the accused's drowsiness, and the opinions of Dr Giuffrida and Dr Reading that the accused is fit to be tried. In my view, Dr Giuffrida's additional report assists in resolving Dr Allnutt's reservation. I accept the opinions of the psychiatrists. 

23I am satisfied that the accused is now in a position to plead to the charge and to make her answer to it. She will be able to understand what is going on in court in a general sense and follow the course of the proceedings. She will understand the substantial effect of any evidence that may be given against her. She has sufficient capacity to be able to decide what defence she will rely upon and to make her defence and her version of the facts known to the Court. 

24Accordingly, I find on the balance of probabilities that the accused is fit to stand trial. 

25I recommend that during the trial the accused's medication be regulated as appropriate and breaks be provided when necessary. I would also suggest that the recommendations made by Dr Giuffrida and Ms Dodds at page 10 of their report (ex D1) be taken into account during the course of the trial. 

26I make the following orders:

(1)I find that the accused Brenda Lee Haines is fit to be tried for the murder of Haibo Wang on 3 March 2001 at Redfern.

(2)In accordance with s 30 Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, the matter is to be placed in the arraignment list of Friday 6 December 2013.

(3)Bail is refused. 

(4)I direct that the accused be returned to the Bunya Unit at Cumberland Hospital and remain under the care of the staff of that unit.

2705900,"GEDEON, Gilbert v R [2013] NSWCCA 257","HEADNOTE
[This headnote is not to be read as part of the judgment]

The appellant was arrested as a result of a New South Wales Crime Commission (Commission) operation. The Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police established a task force in late 2004 to investigate what they believed to be a major syndicate involved in the importation and distribution of cocaine. The operation arose from information supplied by an informer. 

As part of the operation a number of authorities were issued pursuant to the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997, which authorised certain conduct including that the informer possess and supply cocaine to persons including the appellant. This was done in the knowledge the cocaine would not be recovered.

Pursuant to controlled operations authorities, the informer supplied the appellant on two occasions in February and March 2005 with two kilograms and 750 grams of cocaine respectively. On 9 May 2005 the appellant was arrested and charged with two contraventions of s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985.

The appellant and another person challenged the validity of the authorities. The High Court upheld the challenge in Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; (2008) 236 CLR 120. Subsequently the appellant made an application which included that all evidence sought to be relied on by the Crown be excluded pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995.

The appellant also sought leave to cross-examine Mr Mark Standen, who at the relevant time was the Assistant Director of Investigations of the Commission, in relation to charges which had subsequently been brought against Mr Standen. Mr Standen objected on the basis that the evidence might tend to prove that he was guilty of an offence under Australian law or the law of a foreign country. The appellant made several applications to either compel Mr Standen to answer such questions or that his trial be adjourned until Mr Standen's proceedings were completed. The trial judge ruled against the appellant in relation to both matters.
The trial ultimately proceeded before the trial judge sitting alone. The appellant was convicted of both offences and was sentenced to a total term of 15 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment.

The appellant appealed against his conviction and also sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed. The issues for determination on the appeal were:
(i) whether s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (Drug Act) was inconsistent with s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (Customs Act);
and further, whether the trial judge:
(ii) erred by applying the wrong test under s 138 of the Evidence Act by assessing the gravity of the impropriety or contravention by reference to, or comparison with, the offences with which the appellant was charged;
(iii) erred by applying the wrong test under s 138 of the Evidence Act by balancing the overall risk of harm to the public caused by the Commission supplying cocaine against bringing the drug network to an end, and further, by finding that the risk of adverse health consequences to end users was not high;
(iv) erred by failing to exclude certain evidence under s 138 of the Evidence Act by finding that it had not been obtained as a consequence of a breach of s 233B of the Customs Act as the participants had a 'reasonable excuse'; 
(v) in determining that the desirability of admitting evidence of the supplies to the appellant outweighed the undesirability of doing so, erred by failing to give weight to the harm to the public interest, affording too much weight to the beliefs of law enforcement officers that they were acting under a valid authority, and by failing to take into account further improprieties by law enforcement authorities;
(vi) erred in preventing the cross-examination of Mr Standen by concluding his answers would tend to prove that he had committed an offence against a law of a foreign country and, also, that it was not in the interests of justice that he be ordered to answer questions as he would be required to disclose his defence; 
(vii) erred by refusing to adjourn the trial pending the outcome of Mr Standen's proceedings;
and further, in relation to sentence:
(viii) whether the appellant had a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed on a co-offender and a less severe sentence was warranted. 

The Court held, dismissing the appeal:

In relation to (i):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
1. There is no inconsistency between s 25(2) of the Drug Act and s 233B of the Customs Act as the provisions are directed to different offences and there is no area of liability left open by the Customs Act that is closed by the Drug Act: [54]-[63] and [69].
He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984) 157 CLR 523; R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292; State of Victoria v The Commonwealth (The Kakariki) (1937) 58 CLR 618; McWaters v Day (1989) 168 CLR 289; Dickson v The Queen [2010] HCA 30; (2010) 241 CLR 491; R v Stevens (1991) 23 NSWLR 75 considered. Momcilovic v The Queen [2011] HCA 34; (2011) 245 CLR 1 applied.

2. In not providing for a defence of reasonable excuse, the Drug Act does not take away a right or privilege that is available under the Customs Act: [64]-[68]. 
Dickson v The Queen [2010] HCA 30; (2010) 241 CLR 491; R v Stevens (1991) 23 NSWLR 75; R v Daher [1981] 2 NSWLR 669 considered. 

3. It would be immaterial if the effect of the Customs Act was that title to the drugs vested in the Commonwealth at the time of the offence; however, in any event, at the relevant time title had not vested in the Commonwealth: [70]-[71].

In relation to (ii):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
4. The nature of the offence and the gravity of the impropriety are two factors to be taken into account pursuant to s 138(3) of the Evidence Act. The approach of the trial judge did not demonstrate error; the fact that her Honour compared the appellant's conduct to that of the law enforcement officers does not mean that she failed to properly consider the matters in that subsection: [179]-[181].
R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284; (2002) 132 A Crim R 169; Bunning v Cross (1977) 141 CLR 54 applied. 

In relation to (iii):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
5. There was no evidence to justify the conclusion that the risk in releasing a significant amount of cocaine into the community was not high. However, the law enforcement officers' opinions were not irrelevant and the trial judge was entitled to accept their evidence that they believed the risk in distributing the drugs was outweighed by the risk in permitting the syndicate to continue: [182]-[186].
Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; (2008) 236 CLR 120 considered. 

6. The trial judge otherwise considered each of the matters referred to in s 138(3) of the Evidence Act which informed her ultimate conclusion: [187]-[189].

In relation to (iv):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
7. The fact that the law enforcement officers committed the acts with a view to investigating and prosecuting serious drug offences did not constitute a reasonable excuse. The Customs Act creates a scheme for the forfeiture of prohibited imports that leaves no room for goods to be used in an unauthorised operation, while the Crimes Act (Cth) makes limited provision for controlled operations: [190]-[198].
He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984) 157 CLR 523 considered. Dowe v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 44 applied.

8. The evidence obtained on 8 February and 16 March 2005 was produced by offences under the Customs Act: [199]-[202].

9. As a result of the errors found in relation to (iii) and (iv), it was necessary to consider the desirability of admitting the evidence illegally or improperly obtained against its undesirability. Having regard to the matters in s 138(3) of the Evidence Act, the trial judge was correct in admitting the evidence: [216]-[228].

In relation to (v):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
10. If the trial judge properly considered each of the factors under s 138(3) of the Evidence Act and the conclusion she reached was an appropriate exercise of her discretion, the fact she did not refer to the underlying rationale for excluding such evidence would not indicate error: [203]-[206].
R v Latif and Shahzad [1996] 1 All ER 353; (1996) 1 WLR 104; R v Campbell [1999] 1 SCR 565; United States v Santana (1993) 6 F 3d 1 (1993) considered. 

11. The relevant law enforcement officers did not know that their conduct was improper and proceed in reckless disregard of that fact. The officers believed they were acting as part of an authorised operation and their conduct cannot be characterised as reckless: [207]-[213].
R v Helmhout [2001] NSWCCA 372; (2001) 125 A Crim R 257; Director of Public Prosecutions v Marijancevic [2011] VSCA 355; (2011) 33 VR 440 applied.

12. There was no causal link between the further improprieties of the law enforcement officers and the evidence which was produced: [214]-[215].

In relation to (vi):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
13. The trial judge did not err in finding that the interests of justice did not require Mr Standen to give evidence in relation to his pending charges. The trial judge was entitled to doubt whether additional cross-examination would alter the position and also to take account of Mr Standen's position: [284]-[296].
X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; (2013) 87 ALJR 858; Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39 considered.

14. The trial judge was entitled to decline to permit the cross-examination of Mr Standen and to presume that Australian law was unlikely to differ greatly from foreign law as to the import and export of narcotic substances: [297]-[312].
Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd [2005] HCA 54; (2005) 223 CLR 331; BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt [1980] 1 NSWLR 496; Marriage of Atkinson (1997) 136 FLR 347 considered. Damberg v Damberg (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 applied.

In relation to (vii):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
15. The decision of whether to grant an adjournment is discretionary and there was no basis to assess if the appellant's prospects would improve: [313]-[318].

In relation to (viii):
(per Bathurst CJ, Beazley P, Hoeben CJ at CL, Blanch and Price JJ agreeing) 
16. The appellant was not entitled to have a legitimate sense of grievance in relation to the sentence that was imposed on a co-offender: [338]-[345].
Jimmy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540; Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462 considered. 


			Judgment

1BATHURST CJ: Gilbert Gedeon (the appellant) was charged on an indictment for two contraventions of s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (Drug Act). The first count charged that between 5 February 2005 and 9 February 2005 the appellant supplied not less than the large commercial quantity of cocaine, whilst the second count charged that between 15 March 2005 and 18 March 2005 the appellant supplied not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine. 

2Following a trial before a judge sitting alone the appellant was convicted of both offences. He was sentenced on 7 May 2010 to a total term of 15 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment. The appellant appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed.

Background

3The appellant was arrested as a result of a New South Wales Crime Commission (Commission) operation codenamed ""Mocha"". As part of the operation the Commission caused authorities to be issued pursuant to the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997 (Controlled Operations Act) authorising an informer known as ""Tom"" to sell cocaine to other persons. This was done in the knowledge that the cocaine would not be recovered. The appellant was one of the persons to whom the cocaine was sold. The evidence is set out in further detail below.

4The appellant and another person, Mr David Dowe, challenged the validity of the controlled operations authorities, the challenge of which was ultimately successful: Gedeon v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] HCA 43; (2008) 236 CLR 120.

5Following the successful appeal to the High Court the appellant applied for a permanent stay of the proceedings and that ""all the evidence sought to be relied upon by the Crown"" be excluded pursuant to s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995. Following an extensive voir dire the trial judge ruled against the appellant.

6One of the witnesses called by the Crown on the voir dire was a Mr Mark Standen, who at the time of the offences was the Assistant Director of Investigations of the Commission. The appellant sought leave to cross-examine Mr Standen in respect of certain charges that had subsequently been brought against Mr Standen. Mr Standen objected to answering such questions. The appellant sought an order from the trial judge that Mr Standen be compelled to answer such questions or that his trial be adjourned until the proceedings against Mr Standen were completed. Each application was refused by the trial judge. These matters are the subject of Grounds 6 and 7 of the grounds of appeal.

7The trial judge at the conclusion of the voir dire determined that the challenged material, which comprised principally the evidence of Tom and recordings of conversations which he had with the appellant and other participants in the drug operations, was admissible. The appellant sought leave to appeal this decision under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The Court of Criminal Appeal declined leave: R v Gedeon [2009] NSWCCA 278.

8Following the unsuccessful application to the Court of Criminal Appeal the matter came back before the trial judge on 23 November 2009. A further application was made to cross-examine Mr Standen in respect of the charges laid against him which was refused. The trial judge again refused to adjourn the proceedings until Mr Standen's proceedings were finalised. Following the refusal of those applications the trial proceeded as a judge alone trial.

9The trial did not involve any factual issues concerning the appellant's conduct. The appellant in fact made certain admissions pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act. As I indicated, following the trial the appellant was convicted of both offences.

The Crown case

10From December 2004 a Joint Task Force (JTF) had been established between the Commission, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and the NSW Police to investigate what they believed was a major drug syndicate involving the importation and distribution of cocaine. The information which led them to this belief was supplied by Tom.

11Tom gave evidence that on 6 February 2005 he met with the appellant, a Mr Shane Hatfield and another member of the drug syndicate at Rushcutters Bay. The conversation was recorded by way of a listening device concealed on Tom. The effect of the conversation was that the appellant offered to purchase two kilograms of cocaine for $340,000 and Mr Hatfield agreed to the appellant paying $300,000 at the time of supply and $40,000 at a later time. Tom and the appellant agreed to meet at Five Dock on 8 February 2005 to complete the transaction.

12Tom gave evidence that on 7 February 2005 he went with investigators to a bushland area in Wahroonga where seven kilograms of cocaine were buried. The cocaine was then taken to the Australian Government's National Measurement Institute for analysis. The seven blocks returned a gross weight of 6.975 kilograms with a purity of between 59.2% and 69.6%. Two kilograms were then taken to the Commission where they were stored in a safe in the office of Mr Standen.

13On 8 February 2005, 2 one kilogram bags of cocaine with some Glucodin were repacked by Tom under police supervision. Later that day Mr Phillip Bradley, Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer of the Commission, purported to issue an authority under the Controlled Operations Act authorising Tom to supply the appellant or his agent with two kilograms of cocaine in return for payment of $340,000. It also authorised him to hand $340,000 cash representing the sale of the cocaine to Mr Hatfield.

14Tom gave evidence that on 8 February 2005 he and the appellant arrived in separate vehicles at the car park of the Five Dock Leisure Centre. The conversation was recorded by a listening device and the meeting was the subject of video surveillance. Tom handed the appellant the bag containing two kilograms of cocaine and the appellant gave Tom a box containing $300,000 in cash. The appellant asked for more cocaine.

15Mr Kelly Mansfield, an AFP Federal Agent, gave evidence that the appellant placed the bag containing the cocaine into the boot of a Camry motor vehicle. After Tom and the appellant parted, JTF officers took possession of the money which was found to total $300,050. The money was substituted with other cash and returned by Tom to Mr Hatfield. 

16Tom had a further meeting with the appellant and Mr Hatfield at Rushcutters Bay Park on 16 March 2005. Tom gave evidence that the effect of the conversation which took place on that day was that the appellant agreed to purchase a further 750 grams of cocaine for $120,000. It was agreed that Tom and the appellant would meet in the Five Dock area the next day but payment would be made later.

17On 17 March 2005 another controlled operations authority was issued purporting to authorise Mr Standen and Mr McGann, another law enforcement officer, to possess 750 grams of cocaine and supply it to Tom. The authority also purported to authorise Tom to supply the appellant with 750 grams of cocaine in return for payment of $120,000 to be collected by Tom at a later date, retained by him and then handed to Mr Hatfield. Investigators supplied Tom with two bags containing that amount. On that day Tom met the appellant and handed him the cocaine.

18Under the direction of JTF investigators Tom rang the appellant on 4 April 2005 and arranged to collect the outstanding $120,000. The payment was made on 6 April 2005. A controlled operations authority was also issued on 6 April 2005 purporting to authorise Tom to undertake that transaction.

19The appellant was arrested on 9 May 2005.

The grounds of appeal

20As the grounds of appeal raise discrete issues it is convenient to deal with them separately.

Ground 1 - Section 25(2) of the Drug Act is inconsistent with s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) (the Customs Act) insofar as it purports to deal with prohibited imports and as a consequence the indictment and conviction should be quashed

21Prior to dealing with this ground it is convenient to set out the relevant provisions of the Acts in question.

22Section 25 of the Drug Act created the offence of supply of prohibited drugs. At the relevant time it was in the following terms:

""25(1) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

(1A) A person of or above the age of 18 years who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, a prohibited drug (other than cannabis leaf) to a person under the age of 16 years is guilty of an offence.

(2) A person who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug is guilty of an offence.

(2A) A person of or above the age of 18 years who supplies, or who knowingly takes part in the supply of, an amount of a prohibited drug (other than cannabis leaf) which is not less than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug to a person under the age of 16 years is guilty of an offence.

(2B) Where, on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (1A) or (2A), the jury are satisfied that the person charged had, at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the person to whom the prohibited drug was supplied was of or above the age of 16 years, they may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2), respectively, and the person is liable to punishment accordingly.

(3) Where, on the trial of a person for an offence under subsection (2), the jury are not satisfied that the amount of prohibited drug involved is equal to or more than the commercial quantity applicable to the prohibited drug, they may acquit the person of the offence charged and find the person guilty of an offence under subsection (1), and the person shall be liable to punishment accordingly.

(4) Nothing in this section renders unlawful the supply of a prohibited drug by: 

(a) a person licensed or authorised to do so under the Poisons Act 1966, or

(b) a person acting in accordance with an authority granted by the Secretary of the Department of Health where the Secretary is satisfied that the supply of the prohibited drug is for the purpose of scientific research, instruction, analysis or study, or

(c) a person acting in accordance with a direction given by the Commissioner of Police under section 39RA,

or renders unlawful the taking part by any other person in the supply of a prohibited drug by a person to whom paragraph (a), (b) or (c) applies.

(5) Nothing in this section renders unlawful the administration of a prohibited drug to a person being cared for by another person in the circumstances described in section 10(2)(d).""

23Section 29 of the Drug Act sets out circumstances where possession is taken to be possession for supply. It provides as follows:

""29 A person who has in his or her possession an amount of a prohibited drug which is not less than the traffickable quantity of the prohibited drug shall, for the purposes of this Division, be deemed to have the prohibited drug in his or her possession for supply, unless: 

(a) the person proves that he or she had the prohibited drug in his or her possession otherwise than for supply, or

(b) except where the prohibited drug is prepared opium, cannabis leaf, cannabis oil, cannabis resin, heroin or 6-monoacetylmorphine or any other acetylated derivatives of morphine, the person proves that he or she obtained possession of the prohibited drug on and in accordance with the prescription of a medical practitioner, nurse practitioner, midwife practitioner, dentist or veterinary surgeon.""

24It should be noted that a traffickable quantity for the drug in question is 3 grams.

25Supply is defined in s 3 of the Drug Act as follows:

""supply includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply, or authorising, directing, causing, suffering, permitting or attempting any of those acts or things.""

26Section 33 provides a graduated scale of penalties for offences under s 25(2). It provides as follows:

""33(1) This section applies to the following offences: 

(a) an offence under section 23(2), 24(2) or 25(2) or (2A),

(b) an offence under section 26 of conspiring to commit an offence referred to in paragraph (a),

(c) an offence under section 27 of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, soliciting or inciting the commission of an offence referred to in paragraph (a),

(d) an offence under section 28 of conspiring to commit, or of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, soliciting or inciting the commission of, an offence under a law in force outside New South Wales which corresponds to section 23(2), 24(2) or 25(2) or (2A).

(2) The penalty for an offence is: 

(a) except as provided by paragraph (b), a fine of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both, or

(b) where the offence relates to cannabis plant or cannabis leaf, a fine of 3,500 penalty units or imprisonment for 15 years, or both.

(3) Despite subsection (2), if the court is satisfied that the offence involved not less than the large commercial quantity of the prohibited plant or prohibited drug concerned, the penalty for the offence is: 

(a) except as provided by paragraph (b), a fine of 5,000 penalty units or imprisonment for life, or both, or

(b) where the offence relates to cannabis plant or cannabis leaf, a fine of 5,000 penalty units or imprisonment for 20 years, or both.

(4) In this section: 

large commercial quantity, in relation to a prohibited plant or prohibited drug, means the number or amount, if any, specified opposite the plant or drug in Column 5 of Schedule 1.""

27Finally, the provisions of s 4C(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) should be noted:

""4C(2) Where an act or omission constitutes an offence under both:

(a) a law of the Commonwealth and a law of a State; or

(b) a law of the Commonwealth and a law of a Territory;

and the offender has been punished for that offence under the law of the State or the law of the Territory, as the case may be, the offender shall not be liable to be punished for the offence under the law of the Commonwealth.""

28A commercial quantity of cocaine under Schedule 1 to the Drug Act is 250 grams. A large commercial quantity is one kilogram. The effect of s 4 of the Drug Act is that it is not necessary for the prosecutor to prove the precise amount of the particular prohibited drug contained in any substance which is the subject of the charge including for the purpose of the deeming provision in s 29: R v R2 (1990) 19 NSWLR 513 at 514-515.

29The relevant provision of the Customs Act, s 233B, provided at the time as follows:

""233B(1) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person:

(i) possesses goods on board a ship or aircraft; or

(ii) brings goods into Australia; or

(iii) imports goods into Australia; or

(iv) possesses goods that have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or

(v) conveys goods that have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or

(vi) possesses goods that are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act; or

(vii) fails to disclose to an officer on demand any knowledge in his or her possession or power concerning the importation or intended importation, or bringing or intended bringing, into Australia of goods; and

(b) the goods are a prohibited import to which this section applies.

(1AAB) Subparagraph (1)(a)(i), (ii), (iv), (v) or (vi) does not apply if the person proves that the person had a reasonable excuse for doing the act referred to in that subparagraph.

(1AAC) A person commits an offence if:

(a) the person:

(i) exports goods from Australia; or

(ii) fails to disclose to an officer on demand any knowledge in his or her possession or power concerning the exportation or intended exportation from Australia of goods; and

(b) the goods are a prohibited export to which this section applies.

(1AA) For the purposes of an offence against subparagraph (1)(a)(i), absolute liability applies to the physical element of circumstance of the offence, that the relevant possession is on board any ship or aircraft.

Note: For absolute liability, see section 6.2 of the Criminal Code.

(1AB) For the purposes of an offence against subparagraph (1)(a)(iv) or (v), absolute liability applies to the physical element of circumstance of the offence, that the prohibited imports have been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act.

Note: For absolute liability, see section 6.2 of the Criminal Code.

(1AC) For the purposes of an offence against subparagraph (1)(a)(vi), absolute liability applies to the physical element of circumstance of the offence, that the prohibited imports are reasonably suspected of having been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act.

Note: For absolute liability, see section 6.2 of the Criminal Code.

(1A) On the prosecution of a person for an offence against subsection (1), being an offence to which subparagraph (1)(a)(iv) applies, it is a defence if the person proves that he or she did not know that the goods in his or her possession had been imported into Australia in contravention of this Act.

(1B) On the prosecution of a person for an offence against subsection (1), being an offence to which subparagraph (1)(a)(vi) applies, it is a defence if the person proves that the goods were not imported into Australia or were not imported into Australia in contravention of this Act.

(1C) Any defence for which provision is made under either of the last 2 preceding subsections in relation to an offence does not limit any defence otherwise available to the person charged.

(2) The prohibited imports to which this section applies are prohibited imports that are narcotic goods and the prohibited exports to which this section applies are prohibited exports that are narcotic goods.

(3) A person who is guilty of an offence against subsection (1) of this section is punishable upon conviction as provided by section 235.

(4) This section shall not prevent any person from being proceeded against for an offence against any other section of this Act, but he shall not be liable to be punished twice in respect of any one offence.""

30Section 229(1)(b) provides that prohibited imports shall be forfeited to the Crown.

31At the time of the offences the penalty prescribed for a contravention of s 233B involving the importation of a commercial quantity of a narcotic substance was a fine not exceeding 7,500 penalty units or imprisonment for life or both, or for such period as the court thinks appropriate: s 235(2)(c). A commercial quantity of cocaine under Schedule VI of the Customs Act was defined as two kilograms, and further, unlike the Drug Act the quantity was measured by reference to the amount of pure cocaine found in the substance.

32Cocaine is defined as a prohibited drug for the purpose of the Drug Act and a prohibited import for the purpose of the Customs Act. 

The submissions of the parties

(a) The appellant's submissions

33The appellant acknowledged that his submission on this ground was contrary to what was decided by this Court in R v Stevens (1991) 23 NSWLR 75. However, he submitted that this decision should not be followed in light of the decision of the High Court in Dickson v The Queen [2010] HCA 30; (2010) 241 CLR 491 (Dickson).

34The appellant emphasised that he was relying on what he described as direct inconsistency. He submitted that in R v Stevens supra the focus of the Court was instead on indirect inconsistency, namely whether it was the intention of the Commonwealth legislature to cover the field.

35The appellant submitted there was direct inconsistency between s 233B of the Customs Act and s 25 of the Drug Act. He submitted that s 25 by definition includes the act of possession, relying on the definition of supply in s 3 in conjunction with the deemed supply provision in s 29. He submitted that the prohibition was absolute and the defence of reasonable excuse contained in s 223B(1AAB) of the Customs Act was not available. He also relied on the fact that as was the case in Dickson, the offence related to Commonwealth property by reason of s 229(1)(b) of the Customs Act. 

36In supplementary submissions filed after the decision of the High Court in Momcilovic v The Queen [2011] HCA 34; (2011) 245 CLR 1 (Momcilovic), the appellant pointed to the width of the phrase ""reasonable excuse"" in s 233B(1AAB), submitting that it was an ""exception, exemption, excuse, qualification or justification"" within the meaning of s 13.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (Criminal Code). He submitted that the position was analogous to that in Dickson. He pointed out that in relation to conspiracy, s 11.5(5) of the Criminal Code provided for the defence of withdrawal from the conspiracy in contrast to the provisions of s 321 of the Crimes Act 1958 (Vic). He submitted that s 233B(1AAB) of the Customs Act similarly provides a defence not available under the Drug Act. He submitted that the High Court in Momcilovic adopted the same approach as in Dickson.

37The appellant submitted that the Commonwealth had specifically legislated not only in relation to the importation of narcotics but also to their subsequent possession. He submitted that the Drug Act criminalises the same conduct and therefore closes up one area deliberately left open by the Commonwealth, namely, by removing the possibility that a person in possession might reasonably be excused. He submitted this was a direct inconsistency. 

38At the hearing counsel for the appellant submitted that the defence was in the nature of a right or privilege conferred by the paramount legislature which was taken away by the State legislature. He submitted that the fact it is possible to obey both sets of provisions is not sufficient to avoid such inconsistency.

39Counsel for the appellant also sought to show inconsistency by way of a comparison between s 10 of the Drug Act which creates the offence of possession of prohibited drugs and s 233B(1)(iv) of the Customs Act which concerns possession of imported prohibited drugs. He submitted that by comparison with s 10, s 233B(1)(iv), by reason of s 233B(1AAB), provided for the defence of reasonable excuse. He submitted that that added weight to the proposition that the Customs Act preserves an area free from liability which was taken away by the Drug Act.

40Counsel for the appellant, relying on Dickson, submitted that the offence charged involved dealing with Commonwealth property. He pointed out that the inconsistency in Dickson was found to exist only so far as the Victorian statute in issue related to Commonwealth property. The submission presumably was that the State legislation was not dealing with purely State supply but with Commonwealth property and the question of inconsistency had to be considered on that basis.

41Counsel for the appellant emphasised that in considering this issue the paramount consideration is the text of the legislation and whether there is a direct inconsistency such that s 109 of the Constitution is invoked. He submitted that it was incorrect or irrelevant to say that the reasonable excuse defence was co-extensive with defences available at common law. He submitted that if this was the case there would have been no need to include it. He also submitted that the common law defences were provided for in Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code which applied to offences against the Customs Act. He submitted that in those circumstances the defence of reasonable excuse must mean something other than what is contained in Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code.

(b) The Attorney General's submissions

42The New South Wales Attorney General intervened in the proceedings. The Attorney submitted that the relevant legislation did not deal with the same conduct; he submitted that s 25 of the Drug Act dealt with supply whereas s 233B of the Customs Act dealt with importation. The Attorney submitted that the most that could be said was that the offences share a common element, namely possession of certain substances. However, he submitted this was not the conduct criminalised by s 25 of the Drug Act.

43The Attorney pointed to the two different mental elements for each offence. In relation to possession the prosecution bears the onus of showing that the accused knew that he or she had physical control of the substance, whilst in relation to s 25 it is necessary to establish not only the element of possession but also the intention of supplying the drugs to another person.

44The Attorney submitted the decision in R v Stevens supra remains good law. He submitted that Lee CJ at CL was correct in stating that the provisions were directed to fundamentally different purposes; the Customs Act provisions were directed at importation whereas the Drug Act provisions concerned the control of narcotics within the State, irrespective of their origin.

45The Attorney submitted that the attempt by the appellant to distinguish R v Stevens supra on the basis that it was only concerned with indirect inconsistency was based on the erroneous assumption that there was a categorical distinction between direct and indirect inconsistency. The Attorney pointed out that in all cases it was necessary to carefully analyse the laws in question to determine their true construction and scope referring, to what was said by Gummow J in Momcilovic at [245].

46The Attorney submitted that the inconsistency found in Dickson did not turn solely on the fact that there were differences between the criteria for criminal culpability between the State and Commonwealth laws in question, but rather, the particular character and context of those differences. He submitted that in contrast to the present case, the Commonwealth legislation in Dickson reflected the deliberate choice to exclude certain aspects of conduct covered by the State legislation.

47The Attorney submitted that Dickson was not authority for the proposition that State legislation is directly inconsistent with Commonwealth legislation for the purpose of s 109 of the Constitution if the State legislation omits a defence provided for in the Commonwealth legislation. The Attorney noted that Dickson did not overrule McWaters v Day (1989) 168 CLR 289, and that in Momcilovic, Crennan and Kiefel JJ at [637] cited McWaters v Day as authority for the proposition that inconsistency did not arise merely because of the existence of differences between the two law.

48The Attorney submitted that the notion of reasonable excuse is largely co-extensive with defences available under the common law that are applicable to offences such as those established under s 25(2) of the Drug Act. At the hearing the Solicitor General emphasised that it was incorrect to state that the two sections in question criminalised the same conduct.

(c) The Crown's submissions

49The Crown, which adopted the submissions of the Attorney General, emphasised that the Customs Act provision was a limited regime that criminalised acts related to the importation of narcotic goods. The Crown referred to what was said by Spigelman CJ in R v Campbell [2008] NSWCCA 214; (2008) 73 NSWLR 272 that the Commonwealth in passing the legislation relied on the external affairs power and, in these circumstances, it was hardly surprising that the focus of the section was on imports. The Crown submitted that this statement were consistent with the approach in R v Stevens supra.

50The Crown also emphasised that no reliance was placed on the deeming provision in s 29 of the Drug Act in respect of the charges against the appellant.

51The Crown pointed out that the concept of supply involved the transferring to another of the substance needed, wanted or requested by the person to whom it was to be given and, consequently, it was the physical act of receiving for supply which was the nub of the offence. The Crown pointed out that other physical acts in the definition did not necessary involve possession. The Crown submitted that it was inconceivable that the forfeiture provisions could not prevent the State criminalising such acts.

52Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that contrary to what was put by the appellant, the goods were not Commonwealth property. He submitted that although the goods were forfeited under s 229(1)(b), title did not pass to the Crown until the goods were condemned as forfeited by s 205C of the Customs Act.

53In common with the Solicitor General, senior counsel for the Crown emphasised that s 233B was not directed to supply of drugs.

Consideration

54As I indicated above, the appellant placed reliance on what was described as direct inconsistency between s 233B of the Customs Act and s 25 of the Drug Act. However, as Gummow J pointed out in Momcilovic, care must be taken in speaking of different classes of inconsistency to not obscure the test where reliance is placed on s 109, namely, to apply that provision only after analysis of the laws in question to determine their construction: Momcilovic supra at [245], [261]; see also Crennan and Kiefel JJ at [637].

55In Momcilovic each member of the Court explained that in considering whether s 109 will apply in any particular case, the intention of federal Parliament is ascertained by the conventional process of statutory construction: Momcilovic supra at [111] per French CJ; [245] and [258] per Gummow J; [315] per Hayne J; [474] per Heydon J; [637] per Crennan and Kiefel JJ; [660] per Bell J).

56In the present case it is clear from the language of s 233B of the Customs Act that the section relates to imported goods. Although the offence extends beyond the importation of such goods, those provisions, namely s 233B(1)(iv)-(vii), relate either to goods which have been imported, are reasonably suspected of having been imported or in the case of s 233B(1)(vii), the intended importation of goods.

57The fact that the section is concerned with imported goods can also be shown from the fact that in passing the legislation Parliament invoked its constitutional authority over external trade and commerce. As Spigelman CJ pointed out in R v Campbell supra at [107], the entire focus of the section is on imports and exports.

58To establish an offence under s 233B the prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused knew he or she had the prohibited import in their possession: He Kaw Teh v The Queen (1984) 157 CLR 523 at 545, 584, 589 and 603. It is only if the prosecution can prove that element of the offence that the defence of reasonable excuse under s 233B(1AAB) may arise.

59By contrast, s 25(1) of the Drug Act deals with the supply of drugs within this jurisdiction whether imported or otherwise. The relevant mental element is the intent to supply or to do any of the other acts contained in the extended definition of supply in s 3 of the Drug Act. Supply in that context means to furnish or to provide something which is needed or wanted or required by the person to whom it is given and does not include merely returning it to its owner: R v Carey (1990) 20 NSWLR 292 at 294.

60The appellant's contention that there is direct inconsistency is not based on the proposition that there are conflicting duties imposed by both legislatures, but rather, that the State Act alters, impairs or detracts from the operation of the federal Act. The principle was expressed in these terms by Dixon J in the State of Victoria v The Commonwealth (The Kakariki) (1937) 58 CLR 618 at 630; see also Telstra Corporation Ltd v Worthing [1999] HCA 12; (1999) 197 CLR 61 at [27]-[28]; Dickson at [13]; Momcilovic at [264], [627]. The appellant's contention was that there was a direct collision between the two pieces of legislation in the sense that the Drug Act imposed a greater obligation than provided for by the Customs Act: Blackley v Devondale Cream (Vic) Pty Ltd (1968) 117 CLR 253 at 258-259; Telstra Corporation Ltd v Worthing supra at [27]; Dickson at [22], or that the Drug Act took away a right deliberately excluded from conduct rendered criminal by the Customs Act: Dickson at [22]. 

61In considering the issue it must be borne in mind that inconsistency does not arise merely because the relevant federal and State statutes deal with the same matters in different terms, unless the language of the federal statute indicates an intention that its law be the only law on the subject matter: McWaters v Day supra at 296; Momcilovic at [637].

62An example of two laws operating concurrently in this sense can be found in The Kakariki, in which the respective Commonwealth Navigation Act and State Marine Act provided for the removal of ships sunk in a port within the State of Victoria. Dixon J pointed out that in such circumstances there was no reason for treating the federal legislation as intending to do more than confer a concurrent or parallel power to enforce the removing of wrecks; his Honour stated that there would be operational inconsistency if there were simultaneous attempts by both authorities to remove a wreck. The question of dual prosecution in the present case is dealt with by s 4C(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth), to which I have referred above.

63McWaters v Day supra involved offences of driving whilst intoxicated under the Traffic Act 1949 (Qld), which carried a maximum penalty of nine months' imprisonment or a fine of $1,400 or both, and the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 (Cth), which imposed liability for a similar offence on a defence member or defence civilian with a maximum penalty of 12 months' imprisonment. The High Court held that there was no inconsistency and made the following comments at 299:

""Since the Discipline Act is supplementary to, and not exclusive of, the ordinary criminal law, it follows that it does not deal with the same subject-matter or serve the same purpose as laws forming part of the ordinary criminal law. The result is that there is no inconsistency between s. 40(2) of the Discipline Act and s. 16(1) of the State Act for the purposes of s. 109 of the Constitution. It is accordingly unnecessary to consider the appellant's contention that s. 40(2) is invalid.""

64In the present case the appellant's submission was that in not providing for the defence of reasonable excuse, the Drug Act took away what was described by his counsel as a right or privilege available under the Customs Act, namely, the possession of an imported drug with reasonable excuse. That submission seems to me to be misconceived for a number of reasons.

65First, the Drug Act is dealing with supply and not possession of a drug. The necessary element is intention to supply the drug. It is difficult to see how if the accused was shown to have possession for supply there could be a reasonable excuse for possession. That is illustrative of the fact that the two pieces of legislation are operating in different spheres.

66Second, as was pointed out in R v Daher [1981] 2 NSWLR 669 at 672, the matters encompassed within the concept of reasonable excuse are largely co-extensive with common law defences, answers, justifications or excuses. The difference is that under the Customs Act the onus is clearly on the defendant to establish such justifications or excuses. 

67The deeming provision in s 29 of the Drug Act does not affect the position. It reverses the onus of proof in relation to supply in cases where the Crown has established beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had in his or her possession not less than the trafficable quantity of a prohibited drug. Reversing the onus in that way does not take away any right or liberty left open by the Customs Act, nor does it alter, impair or detract from it.

68The present case can be contrasted with Dickson, which involved two laws covering the same area, namely conspiracy to steal Commonwealth property. The federal legislation in requiring an overt act and permitting withdrawal from the conspiracy prior to the commission of such an act was said to exclude a significant area of conduct to which the State law attached and the State law thus closed a significant area of liberty left open by the federal law: Dickson supra at [25]. The High Court described the inconsistency in the following terms:

""[22] The direct inconsistency in the present case is presented by the circumstance that s 321 of the Crimes Act (Vic) renders criminal conduct not caught by, and indeed deliberately excluded from, the conduct rendered criminal by s 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth). In the absence of the operation of s 109 of the Constitution, the Crimes Act (Vic) will alter, impair or detract from the operation of the federal law by proscribing conduct of the appellant which is left untouched by the federal law. The State legislation, in its application to the presentment upon which the appellant was convicted, would undermine and, to a significant extent, negate the criteria for the existence and adjudication of criminal liability adopted by the federal law. No room is left for the State law to attach to the crime of conspiracy to steal property in the possession of the Commonwealth more stringent criteria and a different mode of trial by jury. To adapt remarks of Barwick CJ in Devondale Cream, the case is one of 'direct collision' because the State law, if allowed to operate, would impose upon the appellant obligations greater than those provided by the federal law.""(Citation omitted)

69In the present case as I have sought to demonstrate, the relevant legislation is directed to different offences and there is no area of liability left open by the Commonwealth which is closed by the Drug Act.

70Further, it would be immaterial in my opinion, if the effect of the Customs Act was that title to the drugs vested in the Commonwealth at the time that the offence took place. The offence is the supply of drugs and there is no reason to conclude that the Commonwealth legislature intended to deliberately leave open an area of liability in respect of supply resulting from title to such drugs vesting in the Commonwealth by virtue of the provisions in the Customs Act. 

71In any event at the relevant time title had not vested in the Commonwealth. Although the drugs are forfeited to the Commonwealth by virtue of s 229(1)(b), for title to pass the goods need to be seized either with or without a warrant pursuant to s 203A or s 203C of the Customs Act and a seizure notice issued in accordance with the terms of s 205. If no claim for the goods is made at the end of 30 days after the issue of the notice, the goods are taken to be condemned as forfeited to the Crown. It is at this point the title vests in the Commonwealth pursuant to s 205G of the Customs Act. This process had not occurred at the time of the offences and, as such, title of the goods had not vested in the Commonwealth.

72It follows from what I have said that R v Stevens (1991) 23 NSWLR 75, although dealing with the question in the context of argument based on indirect inconsistency, was correctly decided.

73In these circumstances Ground 1 of the grounds of appeal is not made out.

Grounds 2 to 5 - Incorrect application of s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 in the admission of evidence establishing the Crown case

74Grounds 2 to 5 are as follows:

""2) Her Honour erred in law, and applied the wrong test under s. 138 Evidence Act 1995, by assessing 'the gravity of the impropriety or contravention' for the purpose of s. 138(3)(d) by reference to, or comparison with, the gravity of the offence with which the appellant was charged.

3) Her Honour erred in law, and applied the wrong test under s. 138 Evidence Act 1995, by balancing the 'overall risk' of harm to the public caused by the NSW Crime Commission supplying cocaine against the 'desirability of bringing to an end the drug importation and distribution network'.

3)A The trial judge erred in finding as a fact that the risk of adverse health consequences to end users was 'not high' in the absence of evidence capable of supporting that finding.

[This ground was added pursuant to leave granted during the hearing of the appeal.]

4) Her Honour erred in failing to exclude the evidence relating to the events of 8 February and 16 March 2005 pursuant to s. 138 Evidence Act 1995, because the learned trial judge determined erroneously that the evidence had not been obtained in consequence of a breach of Commonwealth law, specifically:

i) Her Honour erred in concluding that the actions of the authorities and Tom on 8 February and 16 March were not criminalised by Commonwealth law, since each participant had a 'reasonable excuse' and therefore there had been no violation of s. 233B Customs Act 1901 (C'th); and

ii) Her Honour erred in concluding that, if the defence of reasonable excuse did not apply, then the evidence was not obtained in consequence of the actions of Tom and the authorities;

5) In determining that the desirability of admitting the evidence of the supplies to the appellant outweighed the undesirability of admitting the evidence pursuant to s. 138 Evidence Act 1995, her Honour erred by:

i) Failing to give sufficient weight, or any weight at all, to the harm to the public interest caused by the actions of the authorities;

ii) Affording too much weight to the stated beliefs of the law enforcement personnel that they were acting pursuant to a valid authority issued in accordance with the Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Act 1997; and

iii) Failing to take into account a number of other improprieties, such as (a) the failure to comply with Commonwealth law in terms of forfeiture of the cocaine, (b) the failure to attempt to obtain a controlled operations certificate under Commonwealth law in circumstances where such a certificate would not, and could not, lawfully be issued, (c) the failure to comply with standards relating to the handling of exhibits, particular drug exhibits, (d) the failure to comply with standards relating to the maintenance of the proceeds of crime, and (e) the failure to comply with procedures and protocols relating to the control and handling of informants.""

75I have referred earlier in this judgment to the fact that the appellant sought orders that all the evidence against him be excluded. After an extensive voir dire the trial judge concluded in a judgment given on 14 September 2009 that the evidence she found to be illegally obtained should be admitted under s 138 of the Evidence Act, whilst part of the evidence the subject of the challenge was not obtained improperly or illegally.

76As Grounds 2 to 5 to some extent overlap, it is convenient to deal with them together.

The judgment of the trial judge

77The trial judge referred to the fact that the controlled operations authorities were held to be invalid by the High Court in Gedeon v Commissioner supra, and to the subsequent decision of the this Court in Dowe v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 23; (2009) 193 A Crim R 220, which held that the evidence against the appellant Mr Dowe was admissible under s 138 of the Evidence Act. The trial judge accepted that having regard to the different evidence and submissions before her, the decision in Dowe did not govern the outcome of the application.

78The trial judge accepted that the evidence obtained as a result of the two controlled operations authorities was illegally obtained and consequently, the Crown bore the onus under s 138 of the Evidence Act of establishing its admissibility. The trial judge dealt separately with the categories of evidence said to have been illegally obtained which were not protected by the controlled operations authorities.

79The first piece of evidence was the conversation of 6 February 2005 to which I have referred in par [11] above. Her Honour held that evidence was not obtained in contravention of Australian law, the conversation having been recorded pursuant to a validly obtained listening device warrant. She concluded that there was no inducement or entrapment of the type referred to in Ridgeway v The Queen [1995] HCA 66; (1995) 184 CLR 19.

80The second category was the recovery of the seven kilograms of cocaine from bushland at Wahroonga to which I have referred in par [12] above. Her Honour accepted that this conduct was capable of constituting an offence under the Drug Act. She accepted that this illegal activity produced the evidence about the cocaine including the fact that it was cocaine, its quantity, its provenance and by allowing the commencement of the chain of continuity which ended with its supply to the appellant. Her Honour accepted that it was inadmissible under s 138(1) of the Evidence Act, unless admitted in the exercise of the discretion under that section.

81The third category was the packaging of the 2 one kilogram bags of cocaine on 8 February 2005 referred to in par [13] above. The trial judge accepted this involved a contravention of the Drug Act and that it produced evidence to be relied upon. She again concluded that this evidence was inadmissible under s 138(1) of the Evidence Act subject to the exercise of her discretion.

82The fourth category was evidence that on 22 February 2005 Tom was given one kilogram of cocaine at the offices of the Commission and, in the presence of law enforcement officers, prepared it for sale by dividing it into one bag of 750 grams and one bag of 250 grams. The trial judge accepted this contravened the Drug Act and produced evidence which was inadmissible under s 138(1) subject to the exercise of her discretion.

83The fifth category related to the conversation of 16 March 2005 referred to in par [16] above. Her Honour accepted the argument that the entry into the agreement made in that conversation constituted an offence under the Drug Act, but rejected the proposition that the conversation produced the evidence relied upon by the Crown.

84Her Honour then referred to the other items of illegality relied upon by the appellant. The first concerned possessing and dealing with Commonwealth goods in contravention of the Customs Act without obtaining a Commonwealth controlled operations certificate pursuant to s 15M of the Crimes Act (Cth). 

85Her Honour accepted that there was no application for such a certificate, that the cocaine was a prohibited import and that there were special provisions relating to prohibited imports which were forfeited to the Crown. I have summarised these provisions in par [71] above. Her Honour also accepted that possessing and conveying cocaine without reasonable excuse was an offence against the Customs Act. Her Honour, however, found that there was a reasonable excuse in that the acts were done with a view to investigating and prosecuting serious drug offences. She rejected the proposition that failure to deal with the drugs in accordance with the Commonwealth or State legislation or policing guidelines, removed the reasonable excuse. She declined to follow the minority judgment of Basten JA in Dowe v Commissioner of New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCCA 296; (2007) 177 A Crim R 44 (Dowe (No 2)) to the contrary, stating the High Court did not deal with this issue.

86Her Honour, however, accepted that as a result of s 15I(2A) and s 15M(e) of the Crimes Act (Cth), no such Commonwealth certificate could be issued where illicit drugs were likely to pass out of the control of the relevant law enforcement authority. However, she stated that this did not alter the defence of reasonable excuse.

87Her Honour also expressed the view that even if those illegalities occurred, they did not produce the evidence which the Crown sought to rely on.

88Her Honour then dealt with illegality said to have arisen between the two controlled operations authorities of 8 February and 17 March 2005, when Mr Standen and other law enforcement operators supplied the balance of the seven kilograms of cocaine to Tom to supply to other people pursuant to a controlled operations authorities not challenged in the High Court. The trial judge held that notwithstanding the lack of challenge, the controlled operations authorities should be regarded as invalid as having been issued in almost identical circumstances. However, she concluded there was no causal connection between the illegalities and the evidence.

89The trial judge noted that the allegation of illegality based on a failure to deal legally with the proceeds of crime was not pursued in argument, and further, her Honour rejected the proposition that Tom was induced or encouraged to engage in criminal activities. 

90Her Honour's conclusion was that, subject to the exercise of her discretion under s 138 of the Evidence Act, the evidence of unearthing the cocaine on 7 February, the preparation of it by Tom on 8 and 22 February, and the evidence concerning its transfer from law enforcement officers to Tom and supply to the appellant, was illegally obtained and therefore inadmissible. 

91The trial judge also dealt with the argument that the evidence was infected with a number of improprieties. She accepted, in accordance with Ridgeway supra at 36, that improper conduct is conduct falling below ""the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement"". She said that on one view it was not necessary to deal with the issue as most of the evidence in any event would be inadmissible as illegally obtained unless the discretion under s 138 was exercised. However, she accepted the question of improprieties was relevant to the exercise of her discretion.

92The first alleged impropriety was failing to conform to exhibit handling protocols in relation to drugs, proceeds of crime and related evidence. The trial judge accepted that the activities which took place were not in accordance with those protocols and it was never intended that the drugs be dealt with in accordance with them. However, she did not accept that this was inconsistent with the minimum standards required of law enforcement officers. She referred to the fact that all of the dealings were recorded on video or in statements of officers who knew and understood that the activities were being undertaken as part of a controlled operation.

93The second alleged impropriety was the seizure by and storage of drugs at the Commission. The trial judge stated this did not amount to an impropriety for the same reasons as she had given in relation to the failure to follow protocols.

94The third alleged impropriety was the failure to comply with informer management policies, protocols and requirements including the failure to ascertain the full extent of Tom's criminality. The trial judge accepted there was a failure to comply with the informer management policies, pointing to the failure by Mr Standen to keep records, absence of any direct supervision of Mr Standen and the fact there was no co-handler.

95However, her Honour said that when viewed in context this conduct did not amount to impropriety. She pointed to the fact that there was some record of Mr Standen's dealing with Tom, that Mr Standen reported on an ongoing basis to Mr Bradley and that there was a formal record of interview with Tom. The trial judge also stated that there was no evidence that any of this conduct produced the evidentiary material complained of or that any different evidence would have been produced if Tom had been managed entirely within the policy guidelines.

96The fourth category was dealing with money provided to the Commission by Tom. The trial judge accepted that Tom provided money in a bag handed to a law enforcement officer, Mr Mansfield, and then to Mr Standen probably on 7 February 2005. The bag was later given by Mr Standen to the Commission and receipted as $65,000. Tom in his evidence said he could not recall how much was handed over but said it was between $35,000 and $80,000. The trial judge said given the large sums involved it was not noteworthy, but accepted there was potential that Tom was providing money to Mr Standen for the latter's private purposes. 

97Her Honour accepted that this was an unusual and undesirable way to deal with the funds but she concluded from the evidence that $65,000 was in fact passed from Tom and ultimately to the Commission. Her Honour concluded in those circumstances that what occurred was not improper, but even if it was, there was no causal connection between the conduct and the evidence supporting the Crown's case.

98The fifth category was the failure to comply with the letter and spirit of the JTF agreement. The trial judge accepted that what occurred was outside the terms of that agreement because control over the drugs was lost and ultimately they were presumably supplied to end users. However, she did not accept that this would amount to an impropriety.

99The sixth category was the failure to abide by the Code of Conduct surrounding controlled operations contained in Schedule 1 to the then Law Enforcement (Controlled Operations) Regulation 1998. Her Honour concluded that this submission was largely otiose having regard to the invalidity of the controlled operations authorities. However, she noted that the complaint was that Mr Standen in particular, but also Mr Bradley and the other officers, did not act in good faith in applying for and granting the controlled operations authorities. She said this was relevant to determine whether the illegalities were deliberate or reckless but she did not accept that of itself it constituted an impropriety.

100The seventh category of alleged impropriety was that Mr Bradley had made his decision to issue the authorities prior to 8 February 2005, at the time of a meeting with the Commissioner of Police on 2 February 2005, or that the decision was in fact made by the Commissioner of Police. The trial judge rejected this argument on the evidence, stating that it was appropriate to plan for the operation. She said the evidence established that any agreement reached on 2 February was always contingent on Tom and his information being reliable. She also said that there was no evidence that Mr Bradley made any final decision to grant an authority prior to 8 February, accepting the evidence of Mr Bradley on this issue. 

101The trial judge then dealt with the question of the exercise of discretion contained in s 138 of the Evidence Act, recognising the onus was on the Crown to show that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighed the undesirability of admitting evidence so obtained taking into account at least the factors in s 138(3). She accepted for the purpose of s 138(3)(a) that the evidence was highly probative and for the purpose of s 138(3)(b) very important. She also accepted for the purpose of s 138(3)(c) that the offences for which the appellant was charged were very serious.

102The trial judge also accepted that for the purpose of s 138(3)(d) of the Evidence Act the contraventions by the authorities were serious. She said, however, they were less serious than the appellant's contraventions as they did not occur as part of an organised criminal activity but instead were part of a law enforcement effort. She concluded that in considering the gravity of the contraventions, it was appropriate to consider the motivation and beliefs of those involved in the conduct. She said the evidence that the officers in question believed they were acting in accordance with validly issued controlled operations authorities was overwhelming.

103The trial judge then dealt with the question raised by s 138(3)(e), namely, whether the contraventions were deliberate or reckless. She concluded that the officers concerned did not intend to breach the law, nor were they reckless.

104So far as the officers involved in the actual drug handling and transfers were concerned, she said there was no evidence that they were acting otherwise than in good faith and in the belief that they were participating in authorised controlled operations. She recorded the same conclusion in relation to Tom. 

105In dealing with Mr Standen her Honour noted that he had been arrested in June 2008 and charged with three serious offences. She accepted the material before her tended to throw doubt on his conduct between June 2006 and June 2008, accepting what was said by the Crown Prosecutor that there seemed to have been ""a progression in the relationship from unfortunate to criminal in the continuum of his conduct with the people involved"". She rejected the proposition that the evidence including the charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice brought against Mr Standen had any relevance other than on the question of credibility.

106The trial judge rejected the submission that Mr Standen and Mr Bradley did not act in good faith because they knew that the operation was not able to be authorised. She rejected the proposition they did not genuinely believe that s 7(1)(b) of the Controlled Operations Act only required, in terms of assessing harm to others, that persons in the immediate vicinity of the operation need only be considered. Her Honour also rejected the submission that a failure to obtain legal advice was reckless.

107The trial judge also rejected the submission that there was a deliberate attempt to sideline or exclude the AFP from the operation because Mr Standen and Mr Bradley knew that the AFP would not participate in an operation involving the release of drugs into the community. Her Honour rejected the proposition that Mr Bradley had deliberately engineered the exclusion of the AFP from a meeting on 2 February 2005 when the operation was discussed. She stated that what occurred after 8 February 2005 was inconsistent with an intention by Mr Bradley to sideline those officers in the belief they would take action to bring the operation to an end. She pointed out that when the AFP became aware of the operations they did not withdraw except in a formal way by ensuring that AFP officers could not be designated as law enforcement participants.

108The third component of the allegation of the absence of good faith was a submission that Mr Bradley only paid lip service to the requirements of the Controlled Operations Act. The trial judge rejected that argument on the same basis she rejected the argument that the manner the authorities were issued involved an impropriety.

109The fourth allegation of bad faith was that Mr Standen, with the support of Mr Bradley, was driven to achieve an outcome regardless of rules, policies, guidelines and the law. Her Honour rejected this argument. She said that Mr Standen did not approach the operation knowing it breached the law or being recklessly indifferent to that fact. She said the fact that Mr Standen said he was ""results driven"" and viewed the release of seven kilograms of cocaine into the community as morally justified, did not exhibit recklessness as to his legal obligations.

110Her Honour rejected the argument that bad faith was exhibited by the fact that reports made by Mr Bradley to the Ombudsman did not disclose that the drugs had been released to the community. She said the reports were in accordance with what was required by the reporting provisions.

111So far as Mr Standen's credibility was concerned, the trial judge pointed out that his evidence was supported in all relevant senses by other evidence, particularly by the evidence of Mr Bradley.

112In these circumstances the trial judge concluded that the contraventions of the law and the improprieties were not deliberate or reckless.

113So far as s 138(3)(g) of the Evidence Act was concerned, her Honour accepted ""there has been the myriad civil proceedings"" culminating in the High Court's decision and also minor disciplinary proceedings against the AFP officers, Mansfield and Nelson. She said it was unlikely proceedings would be brought against Mr Bradley and Mr Standen.

114So far as s 138(3)(h) was concerned, her Honour accepted that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the evidence without the illegalities if the overall aim of the JFT was to apprehend all those involved.

115Her Honour also took into account that the case did not involve the police inducing the criminal behaviour. She pointed to the fact that the appellant was a willing participant.

116Her Honour's conclusion was in the following terms:

""70. In the end a decision must be made, if this evidence is to be admitted, that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of doing so. This involves a balancing act. It is a relatively unpalatable situation that law enforcement agencies themselves become drug suppliers. There are few circumstances where that could be condoned. Whilst there was a risk that some end users of this cocaine may suffer adverse health consequences as a result of its distribution into the community, the evidence is that it was to be released through a pre-existing network of drug suppliers to a pre-existing clientele of drug users, and as such it seems to me the risk of such harm was not high. The High Court, of course, found that it was a foreseeable risk, which prevented the decision-maker from issuing the Controlled Operation Authorities but in terms of exercising the discretion I accept that the overall risk was outweighed by the desirability of bringing to an end this much wider drug importation and distribution network, involving the importation and supply of far greater quantities of cocaine in the past and about to be imported, and with a far wider network of criminality and corruption.""

The legislative framework

117In considering the issues that are raised under these grounds it is important to have regard to the relevant statutory framework in which they arise. I have set out the relevant provisions of the Drug Act and the Customs Act above at pars [22] and [29]. The relevant provisions relating to the controlled operations authorities are ss 6 and 7 of the Controlled Operations Act and s 15M of the Crimes Act (Cth). As they stood at the time they respectively provided as follows:

""6(1) After considering an application for authority to conduct a controlled operation, and any additional information furnished under section 5(3), the chief executive officer: 

(a) may authorise a law enforcement officer for the law enforcement agency concerned to conduct the operation, either unconditionally or subject to conditions, or

(b) may refuse the application.

(2) An authority to conduct a controlled operation on behalf of a law enforcement agency may not be granted unless a code of conduct is prescribed by the regulations in relation to that agency.

(3) An authority to conduct a controlled operation may not be granted unless the chief executive officer is satisfied as to the following matters: 

(a) that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that criminal activity or corrupt conduct has been, is being or is about to be conducted in relation to matters within the administrative responsibility of the agency,

(b) that the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct are such as to justify the conduct of a controlled operation,

(c) that the nature and extent of the proposed controlled activities are appropriate to the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct,

(d) that the proposed controlled activities will be capable of being accounted for in sufficient detail to enable the reporting requirements of this Act to be fully complied with.

(4) In considering the matters referred to in subsection (3), the chief executive officer must have regard to the following: 

(a) the reliability of any information as to the nature and extent of the suspected criminal activity or corrupt conduct,

(b) the likelihood of success of the proposed controlled operation compared with the likelihood of success of any other law enforcement operation that it would be reasonably practicable to conduct for the same purposes,

(c) the duration of the proposed controlled operation.

(5) The chief executive officer must keep a written record of the reasons for which the chief executive officer is satisfied as to the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a).

""7(1) An authority to conduct a controlled operation must not be granted in relation to a proposed operation that involves any participant in the operation: 

(a) inducing or encouraging another person to engage in criminal activity or corrupt conduct of a kind that the other person could not reasonably be expected to engage in unless so induced or encouraged, or

(b) engaging in conduct that is likely to seriously endanger the health or safety of that or any other participant, or any other person, or to result in serious loss or damage to property.

(2) A person must not be authorised to participate in a controlled operation unless the chief executive officer is satisfied that the person has the appropriate skills to participate in the operation.

(3) A civilian participant: 

(a) must not be authorised to participate in any aspect of a controlled operation unless the chief executive officer is satisfied that it is wholly impracticable for a law enforcement participant to participate in that aspect of the operation, and

(b) must not be authorised to engage in a controlled activity unless it is wholly impracticable for the civilian participant to participate in the aspect of the controlled operation referred to in paragraph (a) without engaging in that activity.""

""15M On receiving an application that complies with section 15K or 15L in relation to a controlled operation, the authorising officer may give a certificate authorising the operation if he or she is reasonably satisfied that:

(a) it is likely that a serious Commonwealth offence has been, is being or will be committed; and

(b) the nature and extent of the offence, and any suspected criminal activity that is related to it, justifies a controlled operation; and

(c) conducting the operation would not involve intentionally inducing a person to commit a Commonwealth offence, or an offence against a law of a State or Territory, if that person would not otherwise have intended to commit:

(i) that offence; or

(ii) an offence of that kind; and

(d) any unlawful activity involved in conducting the operation will be limited to the maximum extent consistent with conducting an effective controlled operation; and

(e) the operation will be conducted in a way that ensures that, to the maximum extent possible, any illicit goods involved in the operation will be under the control of an Australian law enforcement officer at the end of the operation; and

(f) any unlawful activity involved in conducting the operation will not:

(i) seriously endanger the health or safety of any person; or

(ii) cause the death of, or serious injury to, any person; or

(iii) involve the commission or a sexual offence against any person; or

(iv) result in loss of, or serious damage to, property (other than illicit goods); and

(g) the operation will be conducted in a way that is consistent with the reporting and accountability requirements of this Part; and

(h) if a person who is not a law enforcement officer is to be involved in the operation - the role to be assigned to the person could not adequately be performed by a law enforcement officer.""

118Section 138 of the Evidence Act provides as follows:

""(1) Evidence that was obtained: 

(a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law, or

(b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law,

is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained.

(2) Without limiting subsection (1), evidence of an admission that was made during or in consequence of questioning, and evidence obtained in consequence of the admission, is taken to have been obtained improperly if the person conducting the questioning: 

(a) did, or omitted to do, an act in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the act or omission was likely to impair substantially the ability of the person being questioned to respond rationally to the questioning, or

(b) made a false statement in the course of the questioning even though he or she knew or ought reasonably to have known that the statement was false and that making the false statement was likely to cause the person who was being questioned to make an admission.

(3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account: 

(a) the probative value of the evidence, and

(b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding, and

(c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and

(d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention, and

(e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless, and

(f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and

(g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention, and

(h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.""

The submissions of the parties

Ground 2

(a) The appellant's submissions

119The appellant contended that the trial judge erred in concluding that the contraventions by the law enforcement officers were not grave or even very serious. He pointed to the fact that the offences were the subject of significant penalties including life imprisonment.

120The appellant submitted that the trial judge in coming to her conclusion was wrongly influenced by a comparison between the offences committed by the law enforcement officers and those committed by the appellant. He submitted that such a comparison was erroneous because the gravity of the charges against the appellant were taken into account in considering the matters raised in s 138(1)(c) of the Evidence Act and it was inappropriate to also take them into account in considering s 138(1)(d).

121Prior to dealing with the specific ground of appeal, senior counsel for the appellant emphasised at the hearing that the case involved two questions. First, whether the trial judge made a number of specific errors in admitting the evidence despite the unlawfulness. He identified the unlawfulness as selling several kilograms of cocaine into the community with no knowledge of where it would end up and with little or no meaningful research into the possible harm it might cause. He said the second and more fundamental question was whether the conviction was secured at too high a price.

122In relation to Ground 2, senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the gravity of the impropriety or contravention had to be assessed on its own terms. He rejected the proposition that for the purpose of s 138(3)(d) the gravity of the impropriety could be measured by what it was designed to prevent or achieve, submitting that the balancing exercise required for the purpose of s 138 should be done after all the factors in subs (3) had been considered.

(b) The Crown's submissions

123The Crown submitted that all the trial judge in fact was stating was that the law enforcement officers' motive was not to make financial gain. The Crown referred to cases dealing with s 138(3)(c) of the Evidence Act which state that it is relevant to take into account the motivations and belief of those involved in the conduct in considering the applicability of the provision, implicitly submitting that such matters could also be taken into account under s 138(3)(d): R v Dalley [2002] NSWCCA 284; (2002) 132 A Crim R 169 at [2], [3] and [5]; R v MM [2004] NSWCCA 364 at [34]; R v Camilleri [2007] NSWCCA 36; (2007) 68 NSWLR 720 at [18], [28], [31] and [32].

124In addition to the cases relied on in the written submissions, at the hearing senior counsel for the Crown pointed to the position at common law prior to the introduction of the Evidence Act and, in particular, to what was said by Stephen and Aickin JJ in Bunning v Cross (1977) 141 CLR 54 at 80 that ""[s]ome examination of the comparative seriousness of the offence and of the unlawful conduct of the law enforcement authority is an element in the process required by Ireland's case"": R v Ireland (1970) 126 CLR 321.

125In that context senior counsel for the Crown submitted that it was irresistible that the findings of fact of the trial judge were that the police did not know and did not believe that what they were doing was wrong, at least as far as the most serious offences were concerned. He submitted it was always the belief of the law enforcement officers that the supply of cocaine would be duly authorised. He stated that in those circumstances a comparison of the seriousness of the conduct of the appellant and that of the Commission meant that the balancing process required by s 138 of the Evidence Act came down heavily in favour of the Crown. He submitted the way the trial judge weighed up these matters was entirely appropriate.

Grounds 3 and 3A

(a) The appellant's submissions

126The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in seeking to balance the risk of harm to the community against the desirability of bringing the drug distribution network to an end. Referring to Gedeon v Commissioner supra at [57], the appellant submitted that the evidence did not justify her Honour's conclusion that the risk of harm was not high as the cocaine would be released to a pre-existing clientele.

127The appellant further submitted that the finding was irrelevant as the fact of the risk was the reason the authorities were invalid and the reason why no certificate under s 15M of the Crimes Act (Cth) could have been issued.

128Senior counsel for the appellant submitted at the hearing that it was not open for the trial judge to conclude the risk of harm was not high based on the evidence of Mr Standen. He also submitted that even if it was shown that the risk was not high, the trial judge's ultimate conclusion in par [70] of her judgment, set out at par [116] above, wrongly balanced the risk of harm against the desirability of conviction, thereby misapplying s 138 which required all the factors in s 138(3)(a)-(h) to be taken into account in considering whether the evidence should be admitted notwithstanding the illegality or impropriety.

129Senior counsel for the appellant also relied on what was said in Gedeon v Commissioner supra at 141-2 to the effect that a reasonable person in the position of the Commission would have foreseen that the conduct would involve a risk of seriously endangering the health of some of a numerous class of end users. He submitted that one of the reasons the federal legislature had the requirement that the drugs be kept under control was because of the danger inherent in the distribution of drugs in the community.

130Senior counsel for the appellant pointed to the evidence of Mr Standen that he decided to back his own judgment on this issue. Mr Standen did say that he believed the purchasers were likely to be those persons who had purchased some 200 kilograms of cocaine in the previous six months. This was similar to the evidence of Mr Bradley who said he believed the drugs would go to an established clientele. 

131As I indicated, during the hearing the appellant sought and was granted leave to add Ground 3A of the grounds of appeal. Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that whatever beliefs were held by Mr Bradley and Mr Standen, those beliefs were not capable of establishing the extent of the risk caused by the release of the drugs into the community.

(b) The Crown's submissions

132The Crown submitted that that issue was in fact raised by counsel for the appellant at the trial. I have read the submissions referred to and whilst the risk of injury to health was the subject of argument, the defence counsel did not invite the trial judge to draw the comparison (T889-891).

133Further, the Crown submitted that her Honour's conclusion was consistent with the evidence of Mr Bradley and Mr Standen which she accepted. It is correct that both Mr Bradley and Mr Standen said that they believed the drugs would be delivered through a pre-existing network. However, Mr Standen said he did not consider it likely that first-time users would obtain the drugs, whilst Mr Bradley accepted this was a possibility.

134Finally the Crown submitted that s 138(3) of the Evidence Act does not exclusively state the matters to be taken into account. The Crown submitted that in those circumstances the trial judge was entitled to perform the balancing act undertaken by her Honour.

135At the hearing senior counsel for the Crown submitted that although there was no expert evidence as to the potential harmful effect of the distribution of the drugs, having regard to the experience Messrs Bradley and Standen had in the investigation of drug crimes, some weight could be placed on their evidence. He submitted they were not cross-examined as to the bona fides of their opinions, rather that they were reckless in going ahead on the basis of limited advice regarding the risk of health consequences.

136Senior counsel for the Crown also submitted that what the trial judge was referring to in par [70] of her judgment, set out at par [116] above, was the evidence of Messrs Standen and Bradley.

137Finally on this ground, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that in considering the adverse health consequences of distribution of the drugs into the community it was necessary to weigh that risk against what was being sought to be achieved, namely the investigation and arrest of members of a syndicate which had distributed 200 kilograms of cocaine in the previous year.

Ground 4

(a) The appellant's submissions

138The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to exclude evidence of the events of 8 February and 16 March 2005 because the judge had erroneously determined that evidence was not obtained in breach of a Commonwealth law. 

139The appellant submitted that by 8 February 2005 the cocaine in question had been forfeited to the Crown as a consequence of s 229(1)(b) of the Customs Act and in these circumstances mere possession was an offence pursuant to s 233B(1)(a)(iv) of that Act: R v Chow (1987) 11 NSWLR 561.

140The appellant submitted that whilst her Honour correctly concluded that the events of 8 February and 16 March 2005 were capable of amounting to contraventions of the Customs Act, the defence of reasonable excuse was not available to those involved in the operation. He pointed to the fact that law officers, unless otherwise provided by statute, are in no different a position from an ordinary citizen, referring to R v Salem (1997) 96 A Crim R 421 at 422. The appellant submitted that consistent with the reasoning of Basten JA in dissent in Dowe (No 2), it should have been held that the defence of reasonable excuse was not available.

141The appellant pointed to the fact that s 233 of the Customs Act which dealt with the importation of prohibited imports other than narcotic goods, contained a specific defence for a person who possesses or conveys such goods at the direction of a Customs officer. He submitted the fact that a similar defence was not available under s 233B demonstrated that the imperatives of law enforcement were not sufficient to constitute a reasonable excuse.

142The appellant also submitted that the suggestion that law enforcement could constitute a reasonable excuse undermined the search and seizure provisions in s 203C of the Customs Act, which requires such seized goods to be delivered to the AFP to be dealt with as determined by the Commissioner. He submitted that in those circumstances the only lawful course of action was to deliver the drugs to the AFP. In fact Mr Standen's evidence (at T187) was that after the drugs were uncovered they were handed to Federal Agent Mansfield and placed in an AFP exhibits bag.

143The appellant submitted that Mr Standen must have known of these provisions and thus permitted this contravention of the Customs Act. It should be noted, however, that although Mr Standen admitted he knew of these provisions and also of s 15M of the Crimes Act (Cth), he gave evidence that he did not turn his mind to those provisions at the time.

144In these circumstances the appellant submitted that the trial judge was incorrect in concluding that the failure to comply with State and Commonwealth legislative provisions did not lead to the conclusion of an absence of reasonable excuse. He submitted that as s 15M of the Crimes Act (Cth) made it plain that operations such as the one in question could not have been approved as a Commonwealth controlled operation because of the health danger to end-users, it could not be justified by a defence of reasonable excuse.

145The appellant also submitted that the trial judge was incorrect in concluding that the evidence was not obtained as a result of the illegalities. He submitted it was clear that the evidence could not have been produced if the Commonwealth law had been complied with. In this regard he pointed to the fact that by allowing Tom to be in possession of the drugs, the officers involved in the operation had aided and abetted an offence contrary to s 233B(1)(a)(iv) of the Customs Act and s 11.2(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth). He referred to the fact that if the drugs had come into possession of the AFP they would not have been available for distribution as there was no legislative provision which would have permitted this to occur. In this respect he pointed to the evidence of Federal Agent Gray, the Acting Manager of the AFP's Sydney Office, and the evidence of Assistant Commissioner Phelan. It should be noted, however, that Agent Gray was aware of the possibility of the drugs going to end-users at least after 17 February (T478) and Assistant Commissioner Phelan was aware of the proposal to sell cocaine (T832). The evidence of Federal Agent Nelson demonstrates that he was also aware of that proposal.

146The appellant submitted that in these circumstances, regardless of the effect of the controlled operations authorities, each element of the operation was unlawful.

147At the hearing senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged that throughout his cross-examination Mr Standen maintained that he was concerned about the lawfulness of the operation and believed he was protected by the controlled operations authorities.

148Senior counsel for the appellant submitted that the formulation of a plan to dig up the cocaine and their actual digging up involved overt acts in a conspiracy to take possession of imported drugs contrary to s 233B of the Customs Act and, as her Honour found, the subsequent activities in respect of those drugs also involved a contravention of that Act. He said that once it was known that the drugs in question were imported drugs, the bona fide reliance on the controlled operations authorities would not amount to a reasonable excuse.

149Senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that the illegality produced the evidence. He submitted that in considering this issue the approach of Judge Hulme (as his Honour then was) in the second trial of Mr Dowe was appropriate. In his judgment on the voir dire in that trial his Honour made the following remarks:

""on the rather simplistic basis that if it was not for the possessing and the conveying of the cocaine by the authorities and their agent, much of the evidence that the Crown now seeks to rely upon to establish the guilt of each of the accused would not have been obtained.""

(b) The Crown's submissions

150The Crown submitted that the search and seizure provisions, particularly as set out in s 203C and related provisions of the Customs Act, did not apply to the retrieval of the cocaine from the bushland at Wahroonga.

151The Crown also submitted that Basten JA in Dowe (No 2) was in error in concluding that Ridgeway supra was authority for the proposition that deliberate release of drugs into circulation could not involve possession with reasonable excuse. The Crown submitted that law officers in that case were knowingly concerned in the importation of drugs in contravention of s 233B(1)(b) and s 233B(1)(d) to which that defence did not apply. The Crown submitted that the analysis of Hall J in Dowe v Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission [2006] NSWSC 1312; (2006) 206 FLR 1 was to be preferred. The Crown submitted that the fact the officers were acting under a belief that what they were doing was authorised, provided a reasonable excuse.

152The Crown also submitted that the trial judge's comment that the evidence was not produced as a result of the contravention of the Customs Act was consistent with the conclusion of this Court in R v Ladocki [2004] NSWCCA 336.

153Senior counsel for the Crown pointed to the background to the events the subject of the proceedings, particularly the establishment of the JTF and the willingness of the federal authorities to grant a certificate to permit a further importation of drugs to take place. He referred to the evidence which gave rise to the opportunity to mount the operation, namely that Tom was asked by Hatfield to sell the balance of cocaine buried at Wahroonga. He referred to the evidence of Assistant Commissioner Phelan, the effect of which was that what State Police did with the imported drugs was a matter for them, and further, to his evidence that he believed that State Police could mount the operation but that the AFP could not.

154Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that the need for a Commonwealth controlled operation certificate was first raised by Basten JA in the Court of Appeal in Dowe (No 2) and by the High Court in Gedeon v Commissioner supra. He submitted that in these circumstances there was a reasonable excuse for the operation because of the fact that the officers believed at all times that the use or proposed use of the cocaine was to be authorised by the State controlled operations authorities.

155Senior counsel for the Crown also submitted that the discussion between Tom and Hatfield to which I have referred in par [11] above was not procured by the police, as the conversation was not infected by what the police were doing in relation to the controlled operation. He said there was no evidence that this was done in furtherance of a conspiracy, stating there was no evidence at that stage of any intention to supply at that time. That submission did not take account of the meeting of 2 February 2005 when the whole operation was discussed with the Commissioner of Police.

156Finally, senior counsel for the Crown submitted that if offences under the Customs Act were committed, in the circumstances they could not be described as serious or grave.

Ground 5

(a) The appellant's submissions

157In dealing with Ground 5(i) of the grounds of appeal, the appellant repeated his submissions in relation to Ground 2 that it was inappropriate to compare his conduct with that of the law enforcement officers.

158The appellant also submitted that the trial judge erred by understating the risk to end-users. He submitted that there was no evidence as to who would ultimately receive the cocaine or what effect it might have. He submitted that the evidence of Mr Standen that the purchasers were likely to be the same persons who purchased 200 kilograms of cocaine from the syndicate in the previous six months, and thus were unlikely to be newcomers to the situation, was not capable of establishing the degree of risk and was in any event an inadequate consideration of the position.

159The appellant also submitted that the reasoning of the trial judge overlooked the considerable danger to public safety caused by the distribution of drugs; he stated that the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment for such offences is recognition of the danger to the community caused by their distribution including its ancillary consequences. He submitted that this risk was required to be taken into account in performing the balancing exercise required by s 138(3).

160The appellant also submitted that the trial judge in performing the balancing exercise failed to consider the extent to which the administration of justice would be brought into disrepute because of the risk that obtaining evidence in the manner undertaken would result in physical harm, and also, would depend upon acts which the legislature had criminalised. Relying on what was said by the High Court in Jago v District Court of New South Wales [1989] HCA 46; (1989) 168 CLR 23 and a number of United Kingdom, Canadian and United States' authorities, R v Latif and Shahzad [1996] 1 All ER 353; (1996) 1 WLR 104; R v Mullen [2000] QB 520; R v Campbell [1999] 1 SCR 565; United States v Bogart 783 F 2d 1428 (1986); United States v Valona 834 F 2d 1334 (1987); United States v Buishas 791 F 2d 1310 (1986) and United States v Santana (1993) 6 F 3d 1 (1993), the appellant submitted that the detriment to the administration of justice was so great the public interest in conviction was outweighed. Adopting the expression used in the United States' authorities, the appellant described the conduct in the present case as outrageous.

161So far as Ground 5(ii) was concerned, the appellant submitted that the trial judge placed undue reliance on the officers' innocent misinterpretation of s 7(1) of the Controlled Operations Act and their intention to bring a criminal enterprise to an end. He submitted that this resulted in an overly restrictive view of s 138 of the Evidence Act being taken by her Honour.

162The appellant submitted that irrespective of any contravention of the relevant legislation the supply of seven kilograms of cocaine into the community could not be regarded as anything but improper and that this was known to Mr Bradley and Mr Standen. However, the evidence relied on in support of this submission rather shows Mr Bradley and Mr Standen recognised the potential harm that would flow from the release of drugs, but balanced that against what Mr Bradley described as the apprehension of people who were ""suppliers of cocaine in the order of hundreds of kilos and would continue to do so unless they were apprehended"". 

163The appellant referred to the approval by French CJ in Parker v Comptroller-General of Customs [2009] HCA 7; (2009) 83 ALJR 494 at [29] of the dictionary definition of impropriety as ""not in accordance with truth, fact, reason or rule; abnormal, irregular; incorrect, inaccurate, erroneous, wrong"". He also referred to the need to identify the minimum standard expected and required of those entrusted with the power of law enforcement. He submitted that had her Honour approached the question in this way, she would have appreciated that the innocent belief of the officers that they were acting with the protection of a valid controlled operations authority, did not prevent their actions being improper.

164The appellant accepted that the trial judge had to conclude that the authorities did not deliberately or recklessly misinterpret s 7(1)(b) of the Controlled Operations Act. However, he submitted that once the relevant consideration was identified as the supply of drugs, its consequential harm and the effect on the administration of justice, it was evident that the operation was improper. He submitted the evidence of Mr Standen and Mr Bradley that it was a high risk and highly unusual operation, demonstrated the impropriety. In that context he referred to the evidence of Mr Standen that the proposed operation was referred to the NSW Police Commissioner because it was controversial and his acknowledgement that irrespective of the legislation, the proposal was controversial in its own right.

165The appellant submitted that the JTF did not conduct itself within the confines of accepted police practice and that the members of the JTF themselves believed they were acting at the very boundary of what was permitted by law. The appellant referred to the evidence of Mr Bradley that what occurred was a radical departure from usual practice and high risk in the context of drugs going into the community, and also to the evidence of Federal Agent Gray that it was near the boundaries of the law. He referred to the evidence of Mr Bradley that the views of the NSW Commissioner of Police were significant because his officers would be involved in a controlled operation which, but for the execution of the controlled operations authority, would involve those officers in criminal offences. It should be noted that immediately prior to giving this evidence Mr Bradley stated that he had considered whether harm would be caused to persons within the immediate vicinity of the operation, which was what he believed was required by s 7(1)(b) of the Controlled Operations Act.

166The appellant also pointed to the fact that each of Mr Bradley and Mr Standen were aware that the AFP was critical of the operation. Mr Standen acknowledged that he was told that this was the case by Federal Agent Gray and earlier by Federal Agent Nelson. However, he denied that Mr Gray told him that the AFP had said they were not going to be involved; rather he said that Mr Gray had told him the AFP objected in principle and would not participate formally in the activities. He said that Mr Gray told him that he was not withdrawing AFP personnel but that they would only take an observing position in those parts of the operation involving supply. The appellant also pointed to the fact that each of Mr Bradley and Mr Standen acknowledged that other members of the staff of the Commission had expressed concerns about the operation.

167The appellant further contended that in considering s 138(e) of the Evidence Act the motivation of the officers to prevent crime was irrelevant.

168So far as Ground 5(iii) was concerned, the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in dismissing or minimising the relevance of the other improprieties to which reference was made in her judgment. In particular, he pointed to the failure to comply with basic and established protocols relating to the handling of proceeds of crime and the use of informers.

169Finally in relation to Ground 5 the appellant contended that the conduct in question had to be considered both individually and as a whole. He submitted that the trial judge applied the wrong test, unnecessarily excluded relevant evidence, took into account irrelevant considerations and ultimately arrived at a conclusion which was unreasonable.

(b) The Crown's submissions

170In relation to Ground 5(i) the Crown relied on its submissions in respect of Grounds 2 and 3. The Crown submitted that the expectation that drugs would be supplied to an established clientele of users assisted in the conclusion that the risk to such groups would be balanced by the anticipated arrest of persons involved in substantial trading of the substance. The Crown stated that this expectation was consistent with views expressed by Adams J in Ward v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 22; (2007) 168 A Crim R 545 at [19].

171The Crown also submitted that it was incorrect to suggest there would be impropriety even if the operation had been lawful. It was submitted that it was for the legislature to determine whether the investigation of crime should be free of the constraints of the criminal law. The Crown referred to what was said by Basten JA in Robinson v Woolworths Ltd [2005] NSWCCA 426; (2005) 64 NSWLR 612 at [37]:

""Before leaving these broad principles, it is necessary to note theindeterminacy of the test identified by reference to inconsistency with 'the minimum standards which a society such as ours should expect and require of those entrusted with powers of law enforcement': Ridgeway (at 36). Such a test invites assertion and counter-assertion, with no objective touchstone to assist in deciding which to accept and which to reject. It is at least doubtfulwhether a majority of the Australian community would have shared the High Court's view of the 'entrapment' of Mr Ridgeway: see for example, the comments of McHugh J (at 85). The answer is not necessarily to eschew the task, but to establish, in advance, standards of conduct against which a claim of impropriety can be assessed. Where no relevant pre-existing standard has been breached, it should be a rare case in which impropriety would lead to exclusion. (Of course, standards may themselves require scrutiny, but no relevant standard was identified in the present case.) And the test of such a case must involve judicial appraisal of all potentially relevant public policy considerations, being the task actually undertaken in Ridgeway. Appeals to 'community standards' will tend to substitute subjective reactions for careful analysis, albeit of ill-defined concepts."" 

172The Crown also pointed to what was said by Basten JA in Robinson v Woolworths Ltd supra that these principles should be applied in considering impropriety for the purpose of s 138.

173So far as Ground 5(iii) was concerned, the Crown submitted that the improprieties complained of were not in fact improprieties and did not have any causal connection with obtaining the evidence in issue.

Consideration

174Section 138 of the Evidence Act requires a similar balancing process to that previously required by the criminal law in respect of evidence illegally obtained: Director of Public Prosecutions v Marijancevic [2011] VSCA 355; (2011) 33 VR 440 at [17]-[18]. The manner in which that process is to be carried out has been modified by s 138, in particular, in two ways: first, the onus is cast on the party seeking to rely on the illegally or improperly obtained evidence to satisfy the court that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability; second, the balancing exercise is to be carried out at least by reference to the criteria in s 138(3). 

175In these circumstances, the principles laid down in cases such as R v Ireland supra, Bunning v Cross supra and Ridgeway supra, remain relevant to the consideration of the issues raised by s 138: Robinson v Woolworths Ltd supra at [21]-[23]; Fleming v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 233; (2009) 197 A Crim R 282 at [18].

176I have referred to what was said by Stephen and Aickin JJ in Bunning v Cross supra at par [124] above. To this may be added what was said by Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ in Ridgeway supra at 30-31 to the following effect:

""At least since Bunning v Cross, it has been 'the settled law in this country' that a trial judge has a discretion to exclude prosecution evidence on public policy grounds in circumstances where it has been obtained by unlawful conduct on the part of the police. That discretion is distinct from the discretion to exclude evidence of a confessional statement on the grounds that its reception would be unfair to the accused. The discretion extends to the exclusion of both 'real' (or non-confessional) evidence and confessional evidence. As Barwick CJ pointed out in R v Ireland in a judgment with which the other four members of the Court agreed, the rationale of the discretion is that convictions obtained by means of unlawful conduct 'may be obtained at too high a price'. In its exercise, a trial judge must engage in a balancing process to resolve 'the apparent conflict between the desirable goal of bringing to conviction the wrongdoer and the undesirable effect of curial approval, or even encouragement, being given to the unlawful conduct of those whose task it is to enforce the law'. The basis in principle of the discretion lies in the inherent or implied powers of our courts to protect the integrity of their processes. In cases where it is exercised to exclude evidence on public policy grounds, it is because, in all the circumstances of the particular case, applicable considerations of 'high public policy' relating to the administration of criminal justice outweigh the legitimate public interest in the conviction of the guilty.""(Citations omitted)

177The exercise of the discretion does not depend on the question of fairness for the accused or for that matter on whether the accused was induced to commit the offence in question: R v Camilleri supra at [31]-[32]. Rather, as was said in Ridgeway supra, it depends on considerations of ""high public policy"" relating to the question of whether the effect of the illegality or impropriety on the administration of justice outweighs the legitimate public interest in the conviction of the guilty.

178During the course of the hearing there was some discussion surrounding the question of whether the exercise of the discretion to admit or reject evidence under s 138 is only reviewable if errors in the sense referred to in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 are demonstrated. The question cannot be said to be finally settled: Fleming v The Queen supra at [22]; Marijancevic supra at [13]; Director of Public Prosecutions v MD [2010] VSCA 233; (2010) 29 VR 434 at [27]; Em v The Queen [2007] HCA 46; (2007) 232 CLR 67 at [55]; Norbis v Norbis [1986] HCA 17; (1986) 161 CLR 513 at 518-519; contra Riley v R [2011] NSWCCA 238 at [161], albeit relating to s 137 of the Act; Dwyer v Calco Timbers Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 13; (2008) 234 CLR 124 at [39], [41]-[43]. However, as I have concluded that the trial judge did fall into error in her consideration of s 138 it is unnecessary to pursue this matter further.

Ground 2

179It is correct as the appellant contended that s 138(3)(c) and s 138(3)(d) of the Evidence Act deal separately with the nature of the offence and the gravity of the impropriety. Nevertheless they are two factors to be taken into account in balancing the matters referred to in the subsection.

180I do not think that in those circumstances the approach of the trial judge demonstrated error. Her Honour was required for the purposes of s 138(3)(d) to assess the gravity of the contravention of the law enforcement officers. As I have pointed out at par [102] above, she recognised that the conduct of the offenders and the law enforcement officers was similar, but stated that the latter conduct was mitigated by the motivation and belief of those involved. Her Honour was thus giving proper consideration to the issues raised by s 138(3)(d). The fact that in the course of reaching that conclusion she compared the appellant's conduct to that of the law enforcement officers, does not lead to the conclusion that she failed to properly consider the matters referred to in that subsection. In R v Dalley supra, Spigelman CJ in dealing with s 138(3)(c) cited with approval what was said by Stephen and Aickin JJ in Bunning v Cross supra, that some examination of the comparative seriousness of the offences is part of the balancing process: see also R v MM supra at [54]. It seems to me that the trial judge was doing no more than undertaking this evaluation.

181It follows that Ground 2 is not made out.

Grounds 3 and 3A

182It seems to me that there was no evidence to justify the conclusion of the trial judge that the risk involved in releasing a significant amount of cocaine into the community was not high. The trial judge was justified in my opinion in accepting the evidence of Mr Standen and Mr Bradley as investigators experienced in the area, that the drugs would be released through a pre-existing network and that it was likely that a significant portion of the drugs would be distributed to a pre-existing clientele. In that context, however, it must be borne in mind as I pointed out earlier that Mr Bradley accepted that it was possible that first-time users would obtain the drugs, whilst Mr Standen stated that he did consider that it was likely.

183However, it does not seem to me that the opinions of Mr Bradley and Mr Standen were capable of proving the fact that the risk of harm to the community was not high. There is nothing to suggest that their experience as law enforcement officers qualified them to express this view and apart from expressing the opinion that the drugs would go to a pre-existing clientele, they did not provide any factual basis for their conclusion.

184In these circumstances it is important to bear in mind what was said by the High Court in Gedeon v Commissioner supra at [57]:

""A reasonable person in the position of the defendant would have foreseen that the conduct of the activities the subject of the Authorities would involve a risk of seriously endangering the health of some at least of the numerous class of end purchasers of the cocaine. The contrary is impossible to reconcile with the legislative judgment, reflected both in federal and State law, prohibiting respectively the importation, supply and possession of such drugs. That prospect was sufficient to attract, as the legislative response to such a situation of risk, the prohibition in para (b) of s 7(1) of the LECO Act.""

185It follows in my opinion that Ground 3A of the grounds of appeal has been made out.

186That does not mean that the opinions of the law enforcement officers were irrelevant. The trial judge was entitled to accept their evidence that they believed that the risk involved in distributing the drugs was outweighed by the risk to the community in permitting the operation of the syndicate to continue. Her Honour was entitled to take that evidence into account in the ultimate exercise of her discretion and in considering the gravity of the contravention for the purpose of s 138(3)(d). The appellant did not contend that it could not be taken into account but rather complained that the trial judge placed too much weight on the matter.

187So far as Ground 3 is concerned, if in fact it was the case that all her Honour considered in the exercise of her discretion was the risk of harm to the community in distributing the drugs as compared to the risk of allowing the syndicate to continue to operate, she would have fallen into error both in failing to take into account all of the matters referred to in s 138(3) and in failing to consider the matters which underpinned the section referred to in Ridgeway supra in the passage I have cited above: see also Pollard v The Queen (1992) 176 CLR 177 at 196 per Brennan, Dawson and Gaudron JJ; 203-204, 209 per Deane J, Mason CJ agreeing at 184.

188However, her Honour had dealt in the paragraphs preceding par [70] of her judgment with each of the matters referred to in s 138(3) of the Evidence Act and her consideration of those matters informed the conclusion she ultimately reached. This was made clear in the concluding paragraph of her judgment to the following effect:

""[72] Taking into account all of the matters which I am required under Section 138(3) and those other matters to which I have referred, on balance I accept that the desirability of admitting the evidence, despite its being in contravention of Australian law, outweighs the undesirability of doing so and it will be admitted in the exercise of my discretion under Section 138(1) of the Evidence Act. The notice of motion is thus dismissed.""

189It follows that Ground 3 has not been made out.

Ground 4

190Subject to the defence of reasonable excuse, the trial judge accepted in par [50(c)] of her judgment that the possession and handling of the cocaine by the law enforcement officers and by Tom would amount to a contravention of s 233B of the Customs Act. Her Honour concluded, however, that the defence of reasonable excuse was available and that if there were contraventions then they did not produce the evidence.

191The trial judge identified the reasonable excuse in par [50(c)] of her judgment in the following terms, ""namely that they committed these acts with a view to investigating and prosecuting serious drug offences both past and future"". She said that this was not affected by the fact that a Commonwealth controlled operations certificate could not be issued, preferring the approach of Judge Hulme (as his Honour then was) in an earlier trial of Mr Dowe to that of Judge Murrell in another trial of Mr Dowe and the views of Basten JA in Dowe (No 2).

192I do not believe that the matters identified by the trial judge constitute a reasonable excuse. A contravention of s 233B(1) arises if the person charged with the offence has knowledge that he or she had the prohibited import in their possession: He Kaw Teh supra at 545, 584 and 603. In the present case it was not in dispute that the law enforcement authorities knew that the drugs were prohibited imports.

193In He Kaw Teh Gibbs CJ, with whom Mason J agreed, described at 539 the defence of reasonable excuse as providing protection to a person who has taken drugs from an addict and is about to destroy them, because he found them and is taking them to the police or because he is an officer of Customs who has confiscated them. Brennan J at 588 said the defence was needed to exempt police and customs officers who have such prohibited imports in possession from time to time in the course of their duty and innocent people who find themselves in possession of narcotic goods either by accident or as a consequence of the action of others.

194Although I accept that these categories of reasonable excuse are not exhaustive, the extent of the defence must be considered in light of two matters. The first is the statutory context itself. The Customs Act contains elaborate provisions for the forfeiture, seizure and ultimate condemnation of prohibited imports: see s 229(1)(b), s 203A, s 203C, s 205 and s 205C. Importantly s 204(4) provides for narcotic goods to be delivered to a member of the AFP, whilst s 207 empowers the Commissioner of Police or a Deputy Commissioner of Police to deal with the goods in such manner as he or she considers appropriate. The provision leaves no room for the goods to be used in an unauthorised operation.

195Further, s 15M of the Crimes Act (Cth) makes specific and limited provision for controlled operations of the nature of the one said to provide the reasonable excuse in the present case.

196The trial judge did not contend that a mere belief on the part of the law enforcement officers that they were acting lawfully would provide a reasonable excuse for the purpose of s 233B. Mere ignorance of the law is not an excuse.

197The position may well be different if, for example, the officers believed that the drugs were not imported drugs or that they were acting under a valid Commonwealth controlled operation certificate when it was in fact invalid. That is not the case here.

198For these reasons and for the reasons given by Basten JA in Dowe (No 2) at [65]-[71], I am of the opinion that the defence of reasonable excuse was not made out and the trial judge erred in concluding to the contrary.

199I am also of the view that the trial judge erred in concluding that the offences did not produce the evidence.

200In my opinion the approach of Judge Hulme on this issue, to which I have referred in par [149] above, is correct. At the very least but for the taking of possession of the drugs by the State law enforcement officers, the conveying of the drug to the Commission's office, the possession of the drugs by Tom and the conveyance by Tom of two kilograms of the drugs to Five Dock on 8 February and 750 grams on 17 March 2005, constituted offences under the Customs Act which produced the evidence.

201However, I do not believe that the illegalities produced the evidence of the communications of 6 February 2005. It was by no means clear that there was any agreement to supply the drugs at that stage, although it was clearly in contemplation. Even if there was such an agreement it did not produce the conversation in the sense I have described. In any event, this ground of appeal is only directed to the events of 8 February 2005 and 16 March 2005.

202It follows that this ground of appeal has been made out.

Ground 5(i)

203In one sense it is unnecessary to deal with this ground as having regard to the errors to which I have already referred it will be necessary to evaluate whether the evidence was properly admitted. However, it does seem to me that if in fact her Honour properly considered each of the factors in s 138(3) and the conclusion which she reached was an appropriate exercise of her discretion, the fact that she did not refer to the underlying rationale for excluding such evidence, would not indicate error.

204In this context care must be taken in placing reliance on the overseas authorities to which the appellant referred. Thus the test prescribed by Lord Steyn in R v Latif and Shahzad supra at 112, being whether there has been an abuse of process affronting public conscience, demonstrates a somewhat different approach to that mandated by s 138(3) and for that matter the earlier common law authorities in this country. Similarly, the Canadian approach was also based on the doctrine of abuse of process, R v Campbell [1999] 1 SCR 565 at [42]; although somewhat similar to the common law position in this country, the rationale of the doctrine was said to be to protect the integrity of the court's process and the administration of justice from disrepute: R v Campbell [1999] 1 SCR 565 at [43]. The United States' authorities relied upon emphasised the limited ambit of the doctrine outside the right of the accused to due process. For instance, in United States v Santana supra at 9-10, the right to stay or dismiss charges produced by evidence illegally obtained was said to be as a result of invoking disciplinary powers to secure enforcement of better prosecutorial practice and to reprimand those who failed to observe it.

205The other mattes relied on by the appellant were the matters raised in respect of Ground 2 and an understatement of the risk to end-users. I have dealt with these matters in dealing with Grounds 2 and 3.

206It follows that subject to the errors to which I have referred in dealing with the previous grounds, this ground is not made out.

Ground 5(ii)

207As with Ground 5(i) it is strictly unnecessary to deal with this ground because of the need to reconsider the admissibility of the evidence. However, as the matters raised are relevant to the overall assessment of the admissibility of the material and particularly to the matters referred to in s 138(3)(e), it is convenient to deal with them at this stage.

208As I indicated, this ground of appeal relied on the proposition that the distribution of drugs into the community was improper, irrespective of any contravention of the relevant legislation and irrespective of the trial judge's finding that there was not deliberate or reckless misinterpretation of s 7(1)(b) of the Controlled Operations Act. It was submitted that Mr Standen and Mr Bradley knew that their conduct was improper and proceeded in reckless disregard of that fact. I do not agree for the following reasons.

209First, the trial judge made no finding that either Mr Bradley or Mr Standen knew that their actions irrespective of their legality were improper. To the contrary, her Honour found at par [55](a) of her judgment that all of the officers involved in the operation understood and believed that they were handling cocaine and money as part of an authorised operation which aimed to expose a very significant cocaine importing syndicate. Further, she accepted the evidence of Mr Bradley and Mr Standen that they believed in terms of assessing the harm to others that they were only required to consider those in the immediate vicinity of the operation. Further, the trial judge accepted Mr Standen's evidence that he believed that it was morally justifiable to distribute seven kilograms of cocaine into the community having regard to what it was designed to prevent.

210Nor do I believe that her Honour was in error in finding that Mr Bradley and Mr Standen were not reckless. In R v Helmhout [2001] NSWCCA 372; (2001) 125 A Crim R 257 at [33], Hulme J stated the concept ""must involve as a minimum some advertence to the possibility of, or breach of, some obligation, duty or standard of propriety, or of some Australian law or obligation and a conscious decision to proceed regardless or alternatively a 'don't care' attitude generally"". I agree with this formulation subject to the qualification in Marijancevic supra at [85] that the reference to ""don't care"" must be understood as meaning that the person in question recognised that the conduct might be improper but determined to engage in it not caring whether it was or was not.

211In the present case I do not think that the conduct of either Mr Bradley or Mr Standen can be characterised as reckless in that sense. It is true that Mr Bradley recognised that what occurred was a radical departure from usual practice and high risk. This is what prompted him to seek the approval of the NSW Commissioner of Police. Further, so far as harm was concerned, he considered that he was only required by law to consider harm to those persons in the immediate vicinity. This view was consistent with the view of the majority in Dowe (No 2) per Spigelman CJ at [44]-[53], Handley AJA agreeing. Mr Standen's evidence was to the same effect.

212It also must be remembered that Mr Bradley and Mr Standen believed they were acting in accordance with valid controlled operations authorities. In those circumstances when considering according to Ridgeway supra at [36], whether the conduct was inconsistent with minimum standards which a society should expect of those entrusted with law enforcement, conduct carried out under an authority validly issued would not in my opinion be improper in that sense as it was effectively condoned by the legislature. Although the authorities were not valid in this case, a bona fide belief in their validity tells strongly against any reckless disregard of the impropriety about which complaint is made.

213It follows in my opinion that Ground 5(ii) has not been made out.

Ground 5(iii)

214The appellant's submissions focused on the failure to observe protocols relating to the handling of the proceeds of crime and the running of informers. I have set out the nature of these improprieties and the factual finding of the trial judge in pars [94]-[97] above. In my opinion there was no causal link between these improprieties and the evidence which was produced. 

215It follows that Ground 5(iii) has not been established.

Should the evidence have been admitted?

216Having regard to the conclusions I have reached on Grounds 3A and 4, it is necessary to consider whether it was appropriate to admit the evidence. At the risk of repetition, the task required by s 138 of the Evidence Act is to consider the desirability of admitting evidence illegally or improperly obtained against its undesirability, taking into account the matters in s 138(3) and bearing in mind that the ultimate question posed in Ridgeway supra is to resolve the conflict between the benefit of bringing a wrongdoer to conviction, against the adverse impact upon the integrity of court processes by giving curial approval or encouragement to the unlawful conduct of those whose task it is to uphold the law.

217Turning to s 138 itself, for the purpose of s 138(3)(a) there is no doubt that the evidence has high probative value. It directly involved the appellant in the serious drug offences with which he was charged. As the trial judge pointed out, transfer of the cocaine from Tom to the appellant was crucial to the Crown case. So much was not in dispute.

218So far as s 138(3)(b) is concerned, the importance of the evidence is self-explanatory. Without it the whole of the Crown case would have failed. 

219So far as the nature of the offence is concerned, the offences are extremely grave. As the trial judge pointed out, the maximum penalty for the charge the subject of Count 1 was life imprisonment and in respect of Count 2, 20 years' imprisonment. Further, as the appellant submitted, the distribution of drugs within the community can have serious and significant adverse consequences to the health and welfare of the community including not only to the health of end-users, but also as a result of the ancillary criminal consequences that can arise from the activities of drug trafficking and drug dependence. In R v Dalley supra the majority (Spigelman CJ and Blanch AJ) stated at [2] and [102] that the more serious the offence, the more likely it is that the public interest requires the admission of the evidence: see also R v Camilleri supra at [33].

220Section 138(3)(d) requires assessment of the gravity of the impropriety or contravention. As I have indicated, the conduct of the law enforcement officers involves similar breaches of the Drug Act as the offences said to have been committed by the appellant, as well as contraventions of s 233B of the Customs Act. In one sense the fact that contrary to the finding of the trial judge there were contraventions of the Customs Act, adds little to the overall criminality of the conduct of the law enforcement officers. The contraventions arose out of identical conduct to that which constituted the offences under the Drug Act and for which, having regard to the provisions of s 4C(2) of the Crimes Act (Cth), no additional punishment could be imposed. Nevertheless, the fact remains that the actions involved a serious breach of Commonwealth law and one that having regard to the provisions of s 15M of the Crimes Act (Cth) could not have been undertaken under the protection of a controlled operations certificate.

221Further, the activity involved the deliberate release of a significant quantity of drugs into the community. As I have indicated, there was no evidence to support the proposition that this course would have a limited harmful effect. To the contrary, just as with the contraventions by the appellant, there was a significant risk of harm to members of the community by the release of such drugs. This adds to the gravity of the conduct, whether it is considered as a consequence of the contravention of the legislation or as a separate impropriety.

222Against these matters must be put the fact that the law enforcement officers, in particular Mr Bradley and Mr Standen, held a bona fide belief that they were entitled to carry out the operation by virtue of the controlled operations authorities and that in assessing the harm to the community they believed they were only required to consider those persons in the vicinity of the operation. Such an approach had judicial support at least up to the time of the decision in the High Court in Gedeon v Commissioner supra. In addition, regard must be had to the findings of the trial judge that the officers acted in good faith so as to apprehend those responsible for the operation of a significant drug syndicate. Although it is undoubtedly true that the end does not necessarily justify the means, the bona fides of the law enforcement officers and the motivation for their actions are relevant in assessing the gravity of these contraventions or improprieties.

223There was no suggestion that the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

224So far as s 138(3)(g) is concerned, the only proceedings apparently brought in relation to the impropriety and contravention were minor disciplinary proceedings against Mr Nelson and Mr Mansfield, two of the AFP Agents involved in the operation.

225So far as s 138(3)(h) was concerned, the trial judge concluded that it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to obtain the evidence without the illegalities if the overall aim of the JTF was to apprehend all those involved. No issue was taken with that conclusion or the manner in which the trial judge dealt with s 138(3)(h). In particular, it was not suggested the evidence could have been obtained by an operation having the protection of both State and Commonwealth controlled operations certificates, being one which would cease at the time the drugs were passed to the appellant. In these circumstances it is unnecessary to pursue this matter further.

226In all the circumstances and bearing in mind the Crown bears the onus of establishing that the evidence should have been admitted, I am satisfied that her Honour was correct in admitting the evidence. The offences the subject of the charges were significant and there was a significant public interest in obtaining the conviction and preventing the continued operation of the syndicate. Against that, the contraventions by the law enforcement officers were also serious and involved a significant risk to the community having regard to the release of the drugs. However, in light of the findings of the trial judge that Mr Standen and Mr Bradley bona fide believed that they both were acting lawfully and had taken adequate account of the interests of the community in the manner prescribed by the statute, I consider that on balance it was appropriate to admit the evidence.

227The conclusion I have reached is consistent with that reached by this Court in Dowe (No 2). Although the arguments presented were somewhat different and the cross-examination of Mr Bradley and Mr Standen was more extensive in this case, having regard to the factual findings of the trial judge the ultimate issue confronting the Court in each case was the same. Although I have not relied on what was said by the Court in reaching its conclusion in Dowe (No 2), the view I have taken in this case is consistent with it.

228It follows that the trial judge was not in error in admitting the evidence.

Grounds 6 and 7

229These grounds of appeal are as follows:

""6) The learned trial Judge erred in preventing the appellant from cross-examining Mr. Standen in relation to charges which were pending against the witness and in particular:

i) Her Honour erred in concluding, in the absence of evidence, that the answers to the questions the appellant intended to put to Mr. Standen would tend to prove that Mr. Standen had committed an offence against a law of a foreign country; and

ii) Her Honour erred in concluding that it was not in the interests of justice that Mr. Standen be required to answer questions in relation to his pending charges, because, if required to answer such questions, Mr. Standen would be required to disclose his defence, and the certificate would not protect him against derivative use of the information;

7) Alternatively, her Honour erred in refusing to adjourn the appellant's trial, pending the outcome of the proceedings against Mr. Standen.""

Background

230At the time Mr Standen gave evidence on the voir dire at the trial of the appellant he had been charged with three serious offences. The charges were: first, one count of conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of pseudoephedrine between 1 June 2006 and 2 June 2008; second, one count of conspiracy to supply 300 kilograms of pseudoephedrine between those same two dates, that being not less than a large commercial quantity; and third, one count of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice between those two dates by agreeing that he would use the knowledge and information obtained by him to avoid proceedings being instituted or successfully prosecuted with respect to an offence of importing a substance in contravention of Commonwealth law. A Mr Bakhos Jalalaty was charged on the same indictment with the same three offences.

231There was tendered by the appellant on the voir dire a body of material relating to these charges. It included the AFP Facts Sheet summarising the facts on which the charges were based, a record of interview conducted with Mr Standen relating to the charges brought against him and various items of evidence including telephone intercepts said to support the charges. The Facts Sheet contained allegations that certain acts carried out as part of the conspiracy the subject of the charges occurred in the Netherlands, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. They included communications between alleged members of the syndicate in Netherlands and alleged members of the syndicate in Pakistan concerning the quality of 1,000 kilograms of pseudoephedrine, communications between Dutch members of the syndicate and Mr Jalalaty relating to the alleged importation of the drugs, discussions between Mr Jalalaty and members of the syndicate in Pakistan, conversations between Mr Standen and Mr Jalalaty relating to payments to various parties in Lahore and Karachi and various conversations and emails between Sydney, Dutch and Pakistani syndicate members. The Facts Sheet, however, did not allege that any overt acts in the conspiracy were carried out by Mr Standen outside Australia.

232Mr Standen was cross-examined on the voir dire for over three days, the cross-examination occupying some 230 pages of transcript. Towards the end of the cross-examination senior counsel then appearing for the appellant indicated that he wished to cross-examine Mr Standen on matters surrounding the charges brought against him. These included the receipt of money from alleged co-conspirators, correspondence indicating what persons should be alert to when near a container of drugs, the way emails could be used without detection, the use of pseudonyms in emails, trips to Dubai, reference to individuals in the Netherlands, the question of Mr Standen's impecuniosity, a proposal by him to co-opt other members of his family in importation events, discussions about precursors and chemicals, alertness to avoid detection, discussions about a story to be told if detected, discussions concerning transfer of funds through Austrac, discussions concerning the appointment of some person to the Commission inappropriately and sending money via a relative in Hong Kong.

233Mr Standen was represented by counsel who objected to the cross-examination on the basis that the evidence may tend to prove that Mr Standen was guilty of an offence under Australian law and the law of another country and that having regard to the provisions of s 128(4) of the Evidence Act, he should not be required to give such evidence. In addition to tendering material demonstrating that Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates and the Netherlands were signatories to the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Convention) and that pseudoephedrine was on the list of precursors issued by the International Narcotics Control Board, the appellant tendered material from the website of the Ministry of Justice of the Netherlands. This material stated that ""[m]ost acts involving drugs which are offences in other countries are likewise offences in the Netherlands."" It also stated that the import or export of hard drugs was an offence, as was the illegal production of and traffic in precursors, money laundering and planning an offence. It also stated that Dutch policy on law enforcement is ""more explicit than in some other countries, which operate along the same lines in practice.""

234The material was admitted without objection. Further, as senior counsel for the appellant properly accepted at the hearing of the appeal, the trial judge was asked to exercise her discretion on the basis that it was not contended that Mr Standen would not be liable to prosecution under foreign law.

235In a judgment dated 20 August 2009 the trial judge declined to permit counsel for the appellant to cross-examine Mr Standen on material relating to those charges. This decision is the subject of Ground 6.

236Thereafter the appellant applied for an adjournment of the proceedings against him pending the conclusion of the trial of Mr Standen. The application was refused. This ruling is the subject of Ground 7.

237Mr Standen was convicted of the offences charged against him on 11 August 2011. The appellant seeks to rely on this in support of his contention that an adjournment should have been granted. Ultimately it was agreed between the appellant and the Crown that in considering this issue regard could be had to the remarks made on the sentencing of Mr Standen but not to the Crown address or the evidence at his trial.

238In his remarks on sentencing Mr Standen, James J, the trial judge in those proceedings, made the following comments:

""[20] The jury in seeing and hearing the prisoner give evidence for approximately 25 days had an extended opportunity to assess his general credibility and to assess whether the explanations he offered of particular items of evidence might reasonable possibly be true (sic). It can be inferred from the verdicts of guilty returned by the jury that the jury formed an adverse view of Mr Standen's credibility and rejected, as not even reasonably possibly being true, at least many of the explanations he proffered of apparently incriminating evidence.""

See R v Standen [2011] NSWSC 1422.

239James J found that as a result of payments made by a co-conspirator Mr Kinch to Mr Standen in December 2005 and January and February 2006, Mr Standen was irretrievably corruptly compromised as far as Mr Kinch was concerned, although his Honour accepted that that payment was not part of any criminal enterprise which had been entered into.

240James J found that the offending in respect of the offences the subject of the three charges commenced in early 2006. He stated that a payment of $1 million in about February 2006 to Mr Jalalaty was to develop a business as a cover or front for an illicit importation.

241In describing Mr Standen's role in the commission of the offences his Honour stated that Mr Standen, drawing on his knowledge and experience, advised Mr Jalalaty as to what steps should be taken to lessen the risk of the criminal enterprise being detected, that he made inquiries of officers of law enforcement authorities for the purpose of ascertaining whether shipments of the illicit substance had been detected by Customs and that from time to time he acted as an intermediary between Mr Kinch and Mr Jalalaty. He found that for many months Mr Standen knew what substance was going to be imported, how much was to be imported, its value and that he expected to receive a share of the profits of the venture.

242James J found that Mr Kinch and Mr Standen were principals with respect to the importation of the pseudoephedrine into Australia and that the proposed quantity to be imported was not less than 300 kilograms.

The judgment of the trial judge

243In her judgment on this issue the trial judge noted that in relation to all the allegations of illegality or impropriety put to Mr Standen, he asserted that he was at all times acting in good faith, either not turning his mind to some of the issues said to be best practice for law enforcement officers or not being aware of the existence of other matters and in any event, that he never had any deliberate intention to act improperly or in contravention of the law. Further, she noted that he denied acting recklessly.

244Her Honour recognised that in those circumstances the credibility of Mr Standen was relevant to the issue before her on the voir dire.

245Her Honour noted that at the time the issue the subject of this judgment ultimately arose, counsel for the appellant had completed his cross-examination of Mr Standen on all issues except matters relating to the charges brought against him. The trial judge was supplied with a list of issues on which it was proposed to cross-examine and noted that it would include cross-examination to suggest Mr Standen was guilty of the offences with which he had been charged and may also suggest earlier criminality. She stated that as she understood the position, depending on his answers, it may be suggested to him that he had criminal involvement with the informer Tom including money laundering connected with the supply of illegal drugs outside police operations and similar matters.

246In these circumstances the question arose as to whether Mr Standen should be required to be cross-examined on these matters, albeit with the benefit of a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act. Her Honour was informed that Mr Standen would object to answering the questions on the grounds set out in s 128(1) of the Evidence Act.

247Her Honour accepted there would be reasonable grounds for the objection and that she would be obliged to inform the witness that he need not give the evidence unless required to do so by virtue of s 128(4) of the Evidence Act. The effect is that if the witness is required to give the evidence, he or she would obtain the benefit of a certificate under the section which prevents the evidence being used in proceedings in a New South Wales court: Evidence Act, s 128(7). 

248Her Honour accepted that she could only require the evidence to be given if she was satisfied that the evidence did not tend to prove Mr Standen committed an offence against or arising under the law of a foreign country and that the interests of justice require the evidence to be given: s 128(4).

249The trial judge accepted on the basis of the statement of facts against Mr Standen tendered in the proceedings and a folder of transcripts relating to the charges, that some of the activities alleged to have occurred between June 2006 and June 2008 in the drug trafficking syndicate of which he was a member occurred in the Netherlands, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. The trial judge noted that all three countries were signatories to the Convention, which included pseudoephedrine as a precursor used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.

250In these circumstances the trial judge concluded in the absence of argument or suggestions to the contrary, that it was contrary to the law of each of those countries to manufacture, supply, trade in, import, export or otherwise deal with such substances. She also accepted from evidence tendered from the Netherlands Prosecutor's Office that there were criminal offences created in that country involving the sale, transport, production, import or export of such substances, or planning or intending to carry out such activities. She also accepted from that evidence that Dutch law created offences relating to money laundering surrounding such activities.

251However, the trial judge acknowledged that there was no evidence before her from which she could make a finding that an offence of the nature of those charged against Mr Standen in Australia, namely conspiracy to commit any of the substantive Dutch offences existed, and further, even if so whether some of the matters in the statement of facts tendered before her would be evidence under Dutch law to prove that conspiracy.

252Nevertheless the trial judge reached the following conclusion:

""However, taking all of that into account, and given the status of the United Nations Convention and the fact of signature by each of the relevant four countries, and the serious matters which that Convention seeks to control, I am satisfied at least for the purposes of this application that for each of those steps in the conspiracy alleged against Mr Standen where events occurred within another country, and in general terms because of the involvement of at least two Dutch nationals who have now been arrested, that at least some of the questions which Standen would be asked if permitted, would tend to prove that he had committed an offence against or arising under the law of a foreign country, more probably than not contrary to Dutch law.""

253She concluded in those circumstances she could not direct Mr Standen to give evidence which would tend to prove he had committed such offences.

254Against the possibility that she was incorrect in reaching that conclusion and having regard to the fact that not all of the events either occurred outside Australia or involved others outside Australia, her Honour proceeded to consider whether it was in the interests of justice that Mr Standen be compelled to answer such questions: s 128(4)(b).

255Her Honour determined that the interests of justice both in the trial and more generally did not require Mr Standen to answer those questions. She stated that she did not accept that the evidence which may suggest criminal behaviour on the part of Mr Standen was of great significance; she stated that such evidence could only go to credibility.

256Further, the trial judge noted that the source material which would have formed the basis of the cross-examination was tendered before her and in considering the question posed by s 138, she would be entitled to draw such inferences as were available from that material. Her Honour said the only distinction would be that there would be no opportunity to explore explanations given by Mr Standen in respect of the material.

257She then considered the position of the appellant and recognised that he was facing very serious charges, a matter relevant to take into account in considering the interests of justice. However, she also took into account that subject to the questions of admissibility it was a strong Crown case.

258The trial judge took into account the position of Mr Standen and noted that the general principle was that he was not obliged to disclose his defence; her Honour described this principle as significant if not fundamental to the system of criminal law. She recognised however, the statutory inroads made by s 128 of the Evidence Act. Further, she stated that it was important in the administration of justice that the position was not reached where Mr Standen could not receive a fair trial.

259The trial judge also noted the danger to Mr Standen arising from the fact that derivative use may be made of his answers.

260In the circumstances the trial judge concluded that it was not in the interests of justice to require Mr Standen to answer questions directed to the charges against him.

261Her Honour dealt with the subsequent application for adjournment briefly stating that having regard to the findings she made in relation to the s 128 application, the evidence was not so important that it would not be in the interests of justice to require the trial to continue.

The legislative background

262Section 128 of the Act as it stood at the time provided as follows:

""128(1) This section applies if a witness objects to giving particular evidence, or evidence on a particular matter, on the ground that the evidence may tend to prove that the witness: 

(a) has committed an offence against or arising under an Australian law or a law of a foreign country, or

(b) is liable to a civil penalty.

(2) The court must determine whether or not there are reasonable grounds for the objection.

(3) If the court determines that there are reasonable grounds for the objection, the court is to inform the witness: 

(a) that the witness need not give the evidence unless required by the court to do so under subsection (4), and

(b) that the court will give a certificate under this section if: 

(i) the witness willingly gives the evidence without being required to do so under subsection (4), or

(ii) the witness gives the evidence after being required to do so under subsection (4), and

(c) of the effect of such a certificate.

(4) The court may require the witness to give the evidence if the court is satisfied that: 

(a) the evidence does not tend to prove that the witness has committed an offence against or arising under, or is liable to a civil penalty under, a law of a foreign country, and

(b) the interests of justice require that the witness give the evidence.

(5) If the witness either willingly gives the evidence without being required to do so under subsection (4), or gives it after being required to do so under that subsection, the court must cause the witness to be given a certificate under this section in respect of the evidence.

(6) The court is also to cause a witness to be given a certificate under this section if: 

(a) the objection has been overruled, and

(b) after the evidence has been given, the court finds that there were reasonable grounds for the objection.

(7) In any proceeding in a NSW court or before any person or body authorised by a law of this State, or by consent of parties, to hear, receive and examine evidence:

(a) evidence given by a person in respect of which a certificate under this section has been given, and

(b) evidence of any information, document or thing obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the person having given evidence,

cannot be used against the person. However, this does not apply to a criminal proceeding in respect of the falsity of the evidence. 

Note. This subsection differs from section 128 (7) of the Commonwealth Act. The Commonwealth provision refers to an 'Australian Court' instead of a 'NSW court'.

(8) Subsection (7) has effect despite any challenge, review, quashing or calling into question on any ground of the decision to give, or the validity of, the certificate concerned.

(9) If a defendant in a criminal proceeding for an offence is given a certificate under this section, subsection (7) does not apply in a proceeding that is a retrial of the defendant for the same offence or a trial of the defendant for an offence arising out of the same facts that gave rise to that offence.

(10) In a criminal proceeding, this section does not apply in relation to the giving of evidence by a defendant, being evidence that the defendant: 

(a) did an act the doing of which is a fact in issue, or

(b) had a state of mind the existence of which is a fact in issue.

(11) A reference in this section to doing an act includes a reference to failing to act.""

The submissions of the parties

(a) The appellant's submissions

263The appellant submitted the trial judge was in error in concluding that the evidence the subject of the proposed cross-examination may have tended to prove that Mr Standen had committed an offence against or under the law of a foreign country. He relied in particular on what was said by Lindenmayer J in Marriage of Atkinson (1997) 136 FLR 347 at 376-377, that the witness must specify the particular law or at least the class of laws under which such an offence arises.

264The appellant submitted that no such attempt was made as there was no identification of any particular foreign provision upon which Mr Standen relied. The appellant accepted that Mr Standen did not have to prove that it would be likely that he would be convicted of a particular foreign offence, but submitted he had to demonstrate there was a possible offence with which he could have been charged, proving this matter either by expert evidence or use of provisions such as ss 174 and 175 of the Evidence Act.

265The appellant pointed out that mere accession to a convention does not mean that its contents have been incorporated into domestic law. He also submitted that the Convention did not require signatories to criminalise conduct across borders or require the exercise of jurisdiction when the conduct is alleged to have occurred abroad, where the ultimate supply took place abroad and the appellant was not present in the jurisdiction.

266So far as the printout from the Ministry of Justice website was concerned, the appellant submitted that it was not admissible and did not demonstrate that the conduct of Mr Standen constituted a breach of Dutch law. He also submitted that the presumption that, absent evidence, foreign law would be taken to be the same as the domestic law, was difficult to apply in the case of civil law countries.

267On this basis the appellant submitted the trial judge erred in concluding that the evidence which may have been given by Mr Standen may have tended to prove he committed an offence under the law of a foreign country.

268The appellant also contended the trial judge erred in not concluding that the interests of justice required the evidence be given. He submitted that the legislature had abrogated the right against self-incrimination and had struck a fresh balance which was required to be implemented by the courts. He submitted by taking into account the importance of the privilege in determining where the interests of justice lay, the trial judge had robbed s 128 of its purpose and power. In particular, the appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in concluding that derivative use could be made of the material having regard to the provisions of s 128(7) of the Evidence Act.

269The appellant submitted the interests of justice required the evidence be given as the credit of Mr Standen was a central plank in the argument that the evidence the subject of the voir dire should not have been admitted.

270At the hearing, senior counsel for the appellant conceded that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applied having regard to the failure to take objection to the evidence. He submitted, however, that even if there was material which suggested the existence of a foreign offence, the cross-examination could have been tailored to deal with this problem. However, as I indicated, senior counsel for the appellant also conceded that it was not contended at the trial that Mr Standen would not be liable to prosecution under foreign law in respect of the matters the subject of the proposed cross-examination.

271Senior counsel for the appellant also submitted that regardless of the admission of the evidence it was not capable of establishing a foreign offence, although as I have indicated that was not in issue on the voir dire. He also acknowledged that there was no suggestion that Mr Standen was involved in the importation of drugs the subject of the present proceedings and the most that could be put to him was he would do anything to achieve the appropriate outcome regardless of the legal position and also that he did not care if the drugs were harmful. He subsequently stated it would show the general attitude of Mr Standen to compliance with the law.

272So far as the question of an adjournment was concerned, the appellant submitted that any detriment to Mr Standen could have been cured by an adjournment. He submitted that absent the cross-examination, the trial judge could not properly determine the credibility of Mr Standen and there was every reason to conclude that the appellant would have been better off if the trial had been adjourned.

273In supplementary submissions filed after the conviction of Mr Standen the appellant pointed to evidence which was only relevant to the credibility of Mr Standen would have been admissible in the present case. The appellant submitted that this evidence would indicate that Mr Standen had been disbelieved by a jury and that he had been convicted of drug and perversion of justice offences.

(b) The Crown's submissions

274The Crown emphasised the conclusion of the trial judge that the evidence suggestive of criminal behaviour by Mr Standen was not of great significance in the matter for determination on the voir dire and that the source material on which the cross-examination would be based was in fact tendered.

275The Crown submitted there were no authorities supporting the proposition of Lindenmayer J in the Marriage of Atkinson supra, that it was necessary to specify the law or class of law in respect of which the evidence might tend to prove a contravention. However, the Crown accepted that there must be some indication of the relevant threat of self incrimination. The Crown submitted that all that was required was that there were reasonable grounds for a finding that the evidence may tend to prove that a person had committed a particular offence.

276The Crown referred to the statement of Heydon JA (as his Honour then was) in Damberg v Damberg (2001) 52 NSWLR 492 at 505 to the effect that it is well established, subject to numerous exceptions, that where foreign law is not proved it will be presumed to be the same as the lex fori. He submitted the failure of the appellant to object to the material tendered entitled the judge to proceed on the basis that there was no complaint about the acceptance of Mr Standen's case that the material constituted reasonable grounds for concluding that the evidence would tend to prove that Mr Standen had committed an offence against a foreign law.

277The Crown referred to authority which recognised consistently with the opinion of the trial judge that notwithstanding the provisions of s 128(7), the section offered only limited protection: Ross v Internet Wines Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 195; (2004) 60 NSWLR 436; R v Lodhi [2006] NSWSC 638; (2006) 199 FLR 328.

278Senior counsel for the Crown contended at the hearing that the summary of facts tendered on the voir dire related to overseas matters on which the trial judge could rely in concluding that Mr Standen was at risk of being charged with offences overseas.

279In considering the importance of the evidence senior counsel for the Crown emphasised that to a very large extent the evidence of Mr Standen was corroborated by that of Mr Bradley.

280Senior counsel for the Crown submitted that had the adequacy of the evidentiary material been raised, it would have been open to Mr Standen to obtain evidence of the relevant foreign law. However, having regard to the way that the case was conducted by the appellant it was unnecessary for him to do so.

281So far as Ground 7 was concerned, the Crown submitted that the decision to grant or refuse an adjournment was discretionary. The Crown submitted that having regard to the material which went into evidence it would be impossible to conclude that the appellant would have been in a better position if the cross-examination had taken place. The Crown pointed to the fact that there was ample material affecting the credibility of Mr Standen before the trial judge.

282The Crown also pointed to the fact that in assessing the probative value of the evidence, regard would need to be had to the difficulty in assessing dishonesty at a particular point of time from events which occurred subsequent to that time: R v Robinson [1999] NSWCCA 186 at [48]-[49].

283As with Ground 6 the Crown emphasised that the evidence of Mr Standen was by and large corroborated by that of Mr Bradley.

Consideration

Ground 6

284It is convenient first to deal with the question of whether the trial judge erred in determining that the interests of justice did not require the evidence to be given.

285A number of matters should be noted at the outset. First, the onus was on the appellant to establish that the interests of justice required the evidence to be given. That, in my opinion, is the effect of s 142 of the Evidence Act: see S Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law, 10th ed (2012) at [1.3.13060]. 

286Second, the requisite standard provided for in s 128(4)(b) of the Evidence Act is that the interests of justice require admission of the evidence. It is not enough that the evidence be relevant and in this case satisfy the exception to the credibility rule in s 103 of the Evidence Act. This relatively high standard of satisfaction is consistent with the fact that the legislation to a significant extent abrogates a basic common law right.

287Third, as a corollary to the second proposition, the trial judge who has the conduct of the trial is in a considerable position of advantage in dealing with whether the interests of justice require the admission of the evidence. That does not mean a decision is incapable of appellate review, but in considering whether to review a decision, regard must be had to the position of the trial judge who is familiar with the nuances of the trial.

288Fourth, it was not contended in this case that s 128 as a matter of construction precluded cross-examination of a witness in respect of pending charges. Thus the issues of construction which divided the members of the High Court in X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; (2013) 87 ALJR 858 and Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission [2013] HCA 39 do not arise in the present case.

289The application to cross-examine on the material the subject of the charges was made at the conclusion of a lengthy cross-examination of Mr Standen in which a significant attack on his credibility was mounted: see par [232] above. It could not be said in those circumstances that her Honour was in error in concluding that an additional attack on Mr Standen's credit based on material which was in fact before her would not be of real significance such as to require the answers to be given in the interests of justice.

290As the trial judge pointed out in dealing with Mr Standen's credibility, she had the facts and a deal of evidentiary material relating to the charges before her as well as a record of interview in which Mr Standen attempted to explain the material put against him. Her Honour was entitled to doubt whether in these circumstances additional cross-examination would significantly alter the position.

291Further, it must be remembered that the proposed cross-examination was not designed to demonstrate the involvement of Mr Standen in the offences the subject of the charges brought against the appellant; the most it could go to was to support the proposition that Mr Standen would do everything to achieve what he regarded as the appropriate outcome regardless of the legal position, his lack of concern as to whether the drugs were harmful and the general attitude of Mr Standen to compliance with the law. These were matters on which there had already been substantial cross-examination.

292Nor do I think that the trial judge erred in taking into account the position of Mr Standen. In my opinion, the trial judge did not misconstrue s 128(7) and conclude that it did not provide protection against derivative use. She was simply noting the proposition accepted in other cases that the provision of derivative use immunity does not provide complete protection: R v Lodhi supra at [55]; Ross v Internet Wines Pty Ltd supra at [99].

293In the present case the appellant sought leave generally to cross-examine Mr Standen in respect of the charges brought against him. The effect of such cross-examination, even with derivative use immunity, was summarised by Hayne and Bell JJ, with whom Kiefel J agreed, in their joint judgment in X7 supra in the following terms:

""[124] Even if the answers given at a compulsory examination are kept secret, and therefore cannot be used directly or indirectly by those responsible for investigating and prosecuting the matters charged, the requirement to give answers, after being charged, would fundamentally alter the accusatorial judicial process that begins with the laying of a charge and culminates in the accusatorial (and adversarial) trial in the courtroom. No longer could the accused person decide the course which he or she should adopt at trial, in answer to the charge, according only to the strength of the prosecution's case as revealed by the material provided by the prosecution before trial, or to the strength of the evidence led by the prosecution at the trial. The accused person would have to decide the course to be followed in light of that material and in light of any self-incriminatory answers which he or she had been compelled to give at an examination conducted after the charge was laid. That is, the accused person would have to decide what plea to enter, what evidence to challenge and what evidence to give or lead at trial according to what answers he or she had given at the examination. The accused person is thus prejudiced in his or her defence of the charge that has been laid by being required to answer questions about the subject matter of the pending charge.""

294It should be noted that in Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission supra at [54], one member of the majority, French CJ, expressly agreed with these remarks.

295It is true that the trial judge may have been able to control the cross-examination to limit any unfairness which may have arisen: Hamilton v Oades [1989] HCA 21; (1989) 166 CLR 486 at 498-499; Lee v New South Wales Crime Commission supra at [140]. However, the trial judge was entitled to take account of the position of Mr Standen in the manner she did along with the other matters she referred to in determining whether the interests of justice required the evidence to be given.

296It follows in my opinion that the trial judge did not err in finding that the interests of justice did not require Mr Standen to give the evidence.

297In these circumstances it is strictly unnecessary to deal with the question of whether the trial judge was correct in declining to permit the cross-examination on the basis that it tended to prove Mr Standen committed an offence against the law of a foreign country. Nevertheless it is appropriate that I do so.

298I have already pointed to the fact that senior counsel for the appellant acknowledged that no objection was taken to the evidence. In these circumstances r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies to this ground of appeal so far as it relates to the admission of the evidence said to support the proposition that the cross-examination may tend to prove an offence under foreign law. Having regard to my conclusion that the interests of justice did not require that the evidence be admitted, no miscarriage of justice has been demonstrated. It follows that this ground of appeal would fail to the extent it relied on the wrongful admission of evidence.

299However, the appellant submitted that the evidence so admitted did not provide any foundation for the claim that the cross-examination would tend to prove a contravention of foreign law by Mr Standen. 

300To the extent that the trial judge did not deal with this point, there is really no basis for criticism. As the trial judge pointed out (see par [250] above) and as the appellant concedes, it was not in issue before her. Indeed, no submission whatsoever was made by senior counsel for the appellant at the trial on this issue.

301In these circumstances there is a real question as to whether this point should be permitted to be taken or whether the appellant should be bound by the course taken at the trial: see, for example, Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at [9]. At the very least the approach taken by her Honour should be considered in light of this fact.

302I have set out the approach taken by the trial judge above at pars [249]-[252]. The approach her Honour effectively adopted was that while she was not prepared to assume there was an offence of conspiracy under Dutch law similar to the common law (see par [251] above), she was prepared to presume that the Dutch law criminalising the importation and export of narcotic substances was similar to Australian law and that Mr Standen as a participant would be liable for breach of that law.

303In adopting that approach the trial judge was applying the well-known presumption that absent evidence to the contrary, foreign law is presumed to be the same as the law in this country. As set out above, in Damberg v Damberg supra at [119], Heydon JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, described the proposition as well supported. However, he then cited numerous exceptions throughout jurisdictions in the common law world. He stated at [144] by reference to The Parchim (1918) AC 157 that one circumstance where the presumption was applied was when it was assumed to be reasonable to apply English law because it was unlikely to differ greatly from the foreign law. In the result in Damberg, the Court declined to presume that the law of Germany relating to the taxation of capital gains was the same as that of Australia. 

304The presumption can apply in relation to the law of non-common law countries. In Neilson v Overseas Projects Corporation of Victoria Ltd [2005] HCA 54; (2005) 223 CLR 331, a question arose as to whether a Chinese court would exercise its discretion under Article 146 of the General Principles of Civil Law of the People's Republic of China in the same way as it would be exercised by a court of this country. Article 146 permitted a Chinese court in a dispute between foreign nationals of the same country to apply the law of that country to resolve the dispute. The majority was prepared to apply the presumption: Gummow and Hayne JJ at [125], Callinan J at [249], Heydon J at [267], although Gleeson CJ who agreed in the outcome and McHugh and Kirby JJ who dissented, were not prepared to do so. Gummow and Hayne JJ explained the presumption in the following terms:

""[125] If there is thought to be some deficiency in the evidence, the 'presumption' that foreign law is the same as the law of the forum comes into play. That would then require an Australian court to approach the task of construing Art 146 as it would approach the construction of an Australian statute. Neither the absence of pleading the relevant content of foreign law nor the absence of proof would be fatal to the case of the party relying on the relevant provision of foreign law. If the presumption was applied it would follow that the relevant power or discretion would be exercised, as it would by an Australian court under an Australian statute, having regard to its scope and the objects for which it was conferred.""(Citations omitted)

Whilst Callinan J dealt with the issue as follows:

""[249] In those circumstances, the absence of relevant evidence of the Chinese approach to the construction and application of Art 146, it is right in my opinion to presume that the Chinese principles of statutory construction are the same as the Australian ones and to use the latter. This is consistent with authority in which English law has been applied to resolve questions involving a foreign law in the absence of any, or sufficient evidence of that law, which otherwise is in the usual case, to be pleaded and proved as a fact. In Jabbour v Custodian of Israeli Absentee Property, Pearson J, who was confronted with an unassisted need to construe some Israeli statutes, said this: 

'I did not feel entitled or qualified to look through volumes of Palestine or Israeli ordinances or statutes or law reports as they were not in evidence and I would not know which of the ordinances or statutes were still in force or which of the reported decisions were still good law at any material time. It must be assumed that the Israeli rules of construction are the same as the English rules of construction.'""
(Citations omitted)

Heydon J at [267] agreed with each of Gummow and Hayne JJ and Callinan J.

305There is also some uncertainty about which party can rely on the presumption. In BP Exploration Co (Libya) Ltd v Hunt [1980] 1 NSWLR 496 at 503, Hunt J stated that the application of the presumption was to operate against, not in favour of, the party whose obligation it was to prove the foreign law. This statement was cited with approval in Nygh's Conflict of Laws in Australia, 8th ed (2010) at [17.41]. By contrast, Dicey, Morris and Collins on the Conflict of Laws, 15th ed (2012) at [9-025] stated the presumption in the following terms:

""The burden of proving foreign law lies on the party who bases his claim or defence on it. If that party adduces no evidence, or insufficient evidence, of the foreign law, the court applies English law. This principle is sometimes expressed in the form that foreign law is presumed to be the same as English law until the contrary is proved.""(Citations omitted)

306The learned authors, after referring to Damberg v Damberg supra and Neilson supra, state that courts have not yet offered precise guidelines as to when application of the presumption would not be appropriate.

307None of these issues were debated before the trial judge. However, having regard to the material tendered and the absence of any submissions to the contrary, she was entitled in my opinion to assume that Australian law was unlikely to differ greatly from foreign law in this area and to apply the presumption. Both the Netherlands and Australia were signatories to the Convention and the material concerning Dutch law that was tendered without objection showed that the import and export of narcotic substances was criminalised in that country.

308I do not think that the decision of the Full Court of the Family Court in Marriage of Atkinson supra affects the position. The case was an unusual one. The husband had filed certain evidence in relation to his financial position. He declined to answer questions in cross-examination on the ground it might tend to prove offences committed by him against the law of Vanuatu. The trial judge declined to allow the questions to be put but then proceeded to refuse to permit the husband to tender any evidence concerning his financial affairs. The appeal was allowed. Lindenmayer J at 376-377 concluded that as the evidence did not specify the particular law or class of laws in respect of which an offence might be proved, the husband should not have been permitted to decline to answer the questions and thus the whole of his evidence should have been admitted.

309However, the other members of the bench did not adopt the same approach. Baker J at 349 disagreed with Lindenmayer J on the effect of s 128, holding that the judge was correct in finding that the husband was not required to give the evidence. He went on to decide that the trial judge in those circumstances was in error in refusing to permit the husband to lead any evidence as to his financial affairs. The third judge, Smithers J, simply held that irrespective of whether the questions should have been permitted or not, the judge was in error in not permitting the other evidence to be given.

310It is unnecessary to decide if Lindenmayer J was correct. This is because, in my opinion, the class of foreign law to which Mr Standen was liable was adequately identified, namely, participation in the importation and export of drugs.

311The appellant submitted that cross-examination could have been tailored to avoid any potential exposure to foreign law offences. This was not expressly raised in the grounds of appeal or for that matter in the Court below. To the contrary, senior counsel then appearing for the appellant expressly disclaimed such an approach (T466). In these circumstances, this point should not be permitted to be raised in this appeal.

312It follows that Ground 6 has not been made out.

Ground 7

313The decision of whether or not to grant an adjournment is discretionary in the sense that it could only be overturned if an error in the sense described in House v The King supra is demonstrated: R v Alexandroaia (1945) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290; R v MAK [2005] NSWCCA 98 at [13].

314The only error identified is that the trial judge failed to conclude that the appellant might be in a better position if his trial was adjourned until the conclusion of the trial of Mr Standen: R v Collisson [2003] NSWCCA 212; (2003) 139 A Crim R 389 at [34].

315In my opinion there was no error in the exercise of discretion. Having correctly concluded that the interests of justice did not require the evidence to be given on grounds including that it would not be of great significance to her determination on the voir dire, it does not seem to me to be an error of discretion by the trial judge to permit a trial in respect of an alleged offence which had been committed 4½ years previously to continue.

316Quite apart from the significance of the evidence, there was no basis to assess if the appellant's prospects would be improved if a continuation of the trial awaited the trial of Mr Standen. Mr Standen may or may not have given evidence at the trial, the evidence may or may not have assisted the appellant and the jury may or may not have found him guilty. Any benefit to the appellant in these circumstances was entirely speculative.

317Further, whether Mr Standen was convicted or acquitted of the charges, the problem of potential foreign offences would remain. Mr Standen may well have been entitled to refuse to answer questions on the grounds that they tended to prove offences against foreign law.

318It follows that there was no error of discretion in declining to grant the adjournment. This ground of appeal has not been made out.

Ground 8

319This ground of appeal was as follows:

""8) The appellant (applicant) has a justifiable sense of grievance in light of the sentence imposed upon the offender, Mr. Pavan, and a different less severe sentence is warranted and ought to have been imposed.""

320The appellant was sentenced to a total term of 15 years' imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years' imprisonment.

321Mr Robert Pavan who was involved in the same syndicate pleaded guilty to one count of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of cocaine, the quantity being 3 kilograms. The charge particularised three separate supply offences. Mr Pavan was sentenced to a total term of 12 years with a non-parole period of 7½ years. His sentence included a discount of 20% for the utilitarian value of his plea.

The remarks on sentence

322The trial judge noted that the offences were very serious, stating that they involved substantial quantities of cocaine. Her Honour stated that whilst the quantity of cocaine the subject of each count was significantly above the lower limit necessary to constitute the offence (two times in respect of Count 1 and three times in respect of Count 2), the quantities were not such as to aggravate the objective seriousness of the offences. She accepted the drugs were relatively pure.

323The trial judge stated that the appellant played an important role in the syndicate at an intermediate level in the supply chain. She stated that he had a greater organisational role than a mere wholesaler. She accepted, however, that he was not the principal of the syndicate. 

324Ultimately the trial judge concluded that each of the offences were in the middle range in terms of objective seriousness but towards the bottom of that range.

325The trial judge accepted that the appellant made significant concessions and admissions in the conduct of the trial which had significant utilitarian value. She noted that from the outset the appellant conceded that the charge could easily be proved if his challenge to the admissibility of evidence failed. She described the challenge as ""not merely speculative or nonsensical"". 

326The trial judge noted that the whole trial was completed in three days which she described as having significant utilitarian value. She stated that if strict proof was required the trial would have taken at least two weeks or considerably longer. She accepted the sentence should be discounted to reflect the utilitarian value that arose because of the conduct of the accused at the trial.

327So far as the appellant's subjective circumstances were concerned, the trial judge noted that whilst he could not be called a person of good character, nonetheless in both his life before he committed these offences and more so since, he had demonstrated some significant positive attributes.

328She accepted from the history given by the appellant to a Dr Lennings that the appellant commenced using drugs following the death of his sister in 1999, that he overcame that to an extent for a period of time but resumed his association with drugs following a boating accident caused by his negligence in which his fiancé's brother was seriously injured. Her Honour accepted, however, that he committed the offences for monetary gain.

329The trial judge accepted that the appellant had ongoing support from his fiancé and his family. She stated in these circumstances that he had demonstrated excellent prospects of rehabilitation.

330Her Honour accepted that the principles of parity were relevant and stated that the sentence which bore the greatest similarity in terms of criminality and subjective circumstances was that imposed on Mr Pavan. Her Honour made the following comments:

""His role, as I understand it from the sentence imposed by Judge Berman in this Court, was quite similar to that of this offender, in that he identified purchasers and facilitated the supply of the cocaine sourced from Hatfield. He was present and supervised the supply and he was engaged in it for financial gain. The offence was found to be in the middle of the range in terms of objective seriousness. He was somewhat older than this offender, but equally had a minor criminal record and was a drug user. He was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation and to be unlikely to re-offend.

Judge Berman on those findings declined to impose the standard non-parole period, but as I understand it purely on the ground of the utilitarian value of the plea which he assessed at twenty per cent. That as I calculate it must mean that his Honour used a starting point of about fifteen years for that offence and then discounted it in the circumstances. It seems to me that that is a sentence which is a matter that should be considered when assessing relativity or proportionality in relation to this offender and the appropriate sentence.

It is the case that for Mr Pavan, he was facing sentence for one count only, whereas this offender is before the Court for two counts. In large part that does not play, in my view, a significant difference in comparing the two sentences, given that the facts in relation to Mr Pavan indicate that that three kilos was represented by three separate supply offences of one kilo each on three separate occasions dealt with as a rolled up charge. That could equally have been the case in relation to this offender. Of course it was not. The offender gains no credit or mitigation because of those decisions made by the prosecuting authorities.""

331In these circumstances her Honour concluded that the appropriate sentence for Count 1 was a non-parole period of nine years with a parole period thereafter of five years, giving rise to an overall period of imprisonment of 14 years and for Count 2 a non-parole period of six years with a parole period of three years, giving rise to an overall period of imprisonment of nine years. Her Honour stated that only a small amount of accumulation was necessary as in large part the two offences represented one episode of criminality, albeit two separate offences. Having regard to the period the appellant had spent in custody the judge directed the sentence for Count 1 should commence on 16 May 2009 and Count 2 on 16 May 2008.

The submissions of the parties

332The appellant submitted that the roles played by Mr Pavan and the appellant in the syndicate were identical, both acting as go-betweens between Mr Hatfield and other wholesalers. He submitted that the conduct of Mr Pavan was slightly more serious as the quantity of drugs was slightly greater and Mr Pavan had engaged in three rather than two discrete transactions.

333The appellant also submitted the subjective cases were largely identical, both men having only relatively minor prior convictions and good prospects of rehabilitation.

334The appellant submitted that the trial did not involve any factual contest about the appellant's conduct. He pointed to the fact that he sought to challenge the s 138 ruling made by the trial judge but that leave was refused. He pointed to the fact that he was obliged to maintain his plea of not guilty to preserve his right of appeal against the s 138 ruling. He submitted that his manner of conducting the trial facilitated the course of justice which should have been afforded considerable weight in the sentencing process.

335Counsel for the appellant submitted that although it would have been of little utility, it would still have been open to the appellant to put the Crown to strict proof on all issues. He pointed out that Mr Pavan obtained a discount on sentence even though his plea was not forthcoming at the first opportunity.

336The Crown submitted that in sentencing, the trial judge paid particular regard to the sentence imposed on Mr Pavan. It was submitted that her Honour was correct in stating that the appellant gained no credit or mitigation because of decisions made by the prosecuting authorities to impose different charges. The Crown submitted that having taken the sentence of Mr Pavan into account, there was no error in the exercise of her sentencing discretion in imposing a different sentence.

337The Crown submitted that the reduction from the standard non-parole period of 15 years to a parole period of 10 years adequately provided for any discount arising out of the saving of time at the trial.

Consideration

338It is plain that the trial judge took into account the parity principle and the level of co-operation by the appellant and his representatives in the conduct of the trial. The question is whether these matters were adequately taken into account having regard to the sentence imposed on Mr Pavan.

339There are two differences of significance which must be borne in mind. First, Mr Pavan entered a plea of guilty. It is not entirely clear from the judgment of Berman SC DCJ when the plea was entered into but it would appear to have been after the decision in Dowe (No 2). More importantly he did not contest any aspect of the proceedings at least after arraignment.

340By contrast the appellant contested the admissibility of the evidence in a voir dire extending over some 18 days and as a result of his plea in a trial occupying three days. He was fully entitled to take that course and as the trial judge said, his co-operation significantly reduced the length and complexity of the trial. That being said the utilitarian value of his conduct was significantly less than that of Mr Pavan.

341Further, the appellant unlike Mr Pavan, was sentenced for two offences which the trial judge partly accumulated. It has been held consistently in this Court that the parity principle does not extend to correcting any imbalances in the manner in which offenders were charged: R v Formosa [2005] NSWCCA 363 at [44], [54]; Pham v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 25; (2009); 193 A Crim R 190 at [36], [37]; Jimmy v The Queen [2010] NSWCCA 60; (2010) 77 NSWLR 540 at [117], [247]; JOD v R [2009] NSWCCA 205. The appellant did not suggest these cases were wrongly decided.

342In Green v The Queen [2011] HCA 49; (2011) 244 CLR 462, the majority expressed some reservation as to the scope of the principle laid down in these cases. At [30], their Honours made the following comments:

""[30] In Lowe v The Queen and in Postiglione v the Queen, this Court was concerned with the application of the parity principle to persons charged with the same offences arising out of the same criminal conduct or enterprise. Those decisions are not authority for the proposition that the principle applies only to persons so charged. The foundation of the parity principle in the norm of equality before the law requires that its application be governed by consideration of substance rather than form. Formal identity of charges against the offenders whose sentences are compared is not a necessary condition of its application. Nevertheless, as Campbell JA recognised in Jimmy v The Queen, there can be significant practical difficulties in comparing the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes. The greater the difference between the crimes, the greater the practical difficulties, particularly where disparity is said to arise out of a sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the appellant. The existence of those difficulties may be accepted. So too may the inability of a court of criminal appeal to undertake, under the parity rubric, a de facto review of prosecutorial charging discretions. Those practical difficulties and limitations, however, do not exclude the operation of the parity principle. The effect given to it may vary according to the circumstances of the case, including differences between the offences with which co-offenders are charged.""(Citations omitted)

343However, their Honours did not overrule what was said in those cases. The minority expressly stated that in this regard Jimmy supra was correctly decided: Green supra at [90], [91], [122]. Nonetheless, the Court should be mindful of the remarks of the majority just quoted. 

344Having regard to the marked difference between the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty entered by Mr Pavan and the assistance provided by the appellant, and further, to the fact that the appellant was convicted of two charges instead of one in the case of Mr Pavan, the appellant was not entitled to have a legitimate sense of grievance in the objective sense referred to in the authorities: see Green supra at [31]. My conclusion would be the same regardless of whether the approach of the majority in Green supra was applied or the matter was approached by the application of the principles in Jimmy supra and the other cases to which I have referred.

345It follows that this ground has not been made out.

Conclusion

346In the result I would make the following orders:

(1)Appeal against conviction dismissed.

(2)Grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal.

347BEAZLEY P: I agree with the reasons and with the orders proposed by Bathurst CJ.

348HOEBEN CJ at CL: I agree with Bathurst CJ.

349BLANCH J: I agree for the reasons given by the Chief Justice that both the appeal against conviction and the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

350PRICE J: I agree with the judgment of the Chief Justice that both the conviction appeal and the sentence appeal be dismissed.

2705904,Linney v R [2013] NSWCCA 251,"Judgment
1GLEESON JA:  I agree with R A Hulme J.
2R A HULME J:  Darren Linney (""the applicant"") applies for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him by Bellew J on 14 December 2012.  The sentence was one of 3 years 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 5 months and it was imposed following the applicant's plea of guilty to a charge that he threatened to cause injury to a judicial officer on account of something lawfully done, namely delivering a judgment in the District Court in a civil case.
3The offence is against s 326(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years.
Facts
4The facts in the matter were not disputed.  The following summary is largely derived from his Honour's reasons for sentence.
5In 2003, the applicant and his family moved to Emerald Beach in northern New South Wales.  Initially his family got along well with the family next door.  But after a while the relationship soured to a point where the neighbours moved away.  The neighbours commenced proceedings in the District Court against the applicant and his partner, Ms Morris, claiming damages for nuisance, defamation and personal injury.  
6His Honour Judge Johnstone (""the judge"") presided over the hearing of the action over several weeks in February 2012.  He gave judgment on 15 March 2012 in which he gave a verdict for the plaintiffs and ordered the applicant and his partner to pay damages totalling some $189,000.
7The applicant was not present in court when the judgment was delivered.  The judge's associate emailed a copy of the judgment to the applicant together with details as to further orders that had been made in relation to costs.  This was on the morning of 15 March 2012.  Within an hour the associate received an email reply from the applicant in which derogatory remarks were made about both the judgment and the judge.  She informed her judge of the email and placed a hard copy on the court file.  She replied to the applicant to the effect that the judge had no further function to perform in the case and that any further communication should be with the Registrar of the Court.
8On 10 April 2012, an email was received at the Customer Assistance Unit of the New South Wales Police Force.  It was the first of a series of three emails sent by the applicant that are the foundation of the offence.  Each of the emails are quoted at length in Bellew J's sentencing judgment:  R v Darren Linney [2012] NSWSC 1564 at [16]-[20].  
9The email to the police was in quite inflammatory terms.  It included a number of derogatory statements about the applicant's former neighbours and complaints about a perceived lack of assistance the applicant had received from police.  But it also included the following:
""Remember Judge Opas. The next is Judge Jonestone [sic] of the District Court.""  
""A bullet in his head for him would not be a dream.""
""Please take me seriously.""
""Don't think this is a joke."" 
10As Bellew J observed, the reference to ""Judge Opas"" was clearly a reference to the late judge of the Family Court of Australia who was shot and killed at his home by an unidentified gunman in 1980.
11The second email was received by the judge's associate when she arrived at work on Monday 16 April 2012.  It had been sent by the applicant the previous Saturday morning.  It included criticism of the judge in the most vile and derogatory terms.  It warned that the applicant knew where the judge lived.  It threatened, in part:
""Remember Judge Opas.  You should join him.  I will now to the same to you.""
""You being such an incompetent and corrupt judge and a faggot should be wasted.""
""Maybe you should start digging your own hole.  You will rot in hell much quicker and earlier than you anticipate.""
""Can't wait to see your arrogant faggot face.  At close rang[e] at your house.""
""You failed in your duty and now you must pay for your actions.""
12This email also included a threat of similar retribution against counsel who had acted for the plaintiffs.
13The third email was sent to the judge's associate by the applicant on the morning of Saturday 28 April 2012.  Aside from profanities and criticism of the judge and the judgment in similarly derogatory terms as before, it included:
""Just to let you know I will not disappear.  Not until you die.  Your [sic] not going to keep doing this to not only me but others.""
""Nice house you have maggot.  Im [sic] glad you won't get to enjoy it much longer.  What goes around comes around.  You fuck peoples lives - they fuck yours, maggot.""
14Statements made by the judge and his associate after receipt of the 14 April email were tendered before Bellew J.  (This is relevant to a ground of appeal about the harm caused by the offence.)  The statement by the judge included that he had been informed of the first email to his associate and of the email to the police.  When he saw the second email to his associate of 14 April he was ""shocked and concerned"".  He elaborated:
The contents of the [14 April] email sent [by] Mr Linney to my associate have caused me extreme concern.  It is not so much the personal abuse. Rather it is the threats.  In particular the reference to Justice Opas and an insinuation that Mr Linney knows where I live, and he is proposing to come to my house, have been particularly upsetting.  I have of course informed my family of the circumstances.  I live with my wife and two youngest sons and from time to time one of my son's girlfriend stays and these events have worried everyone and unsettled us all.  I am concerned to ensure that all that can be done should be done to protect them and myself from this threat.  I am also concerned about Mr Bates [counsel for the plaintiffs] who is mentioned in the email and of course his clients.  I am also aware that my associate is extremely stressed from these events and is concerned for the safety of myself and my family.  
The style and content of the Linney email are very similar to the Linney letter referred to in my judgment.  My concerns about my safety and my family's safety are heightened by the evidence in the trial in that Mr Linney continued to harass the plaintiffs, even after they had moved away.  He found out where they had moved to and continued to harass them and made at least one harassing phone call to them.
In my view based on my observations of Mr Linney during the trial he is only likely to desist from this sort of threatening behaviour if he is confronted by the police and is either charged or brought before the court.
15The associate's statement contained a description of a similar response to the 14 April email.  She described being ""extremely shocked and upset"" and said ""this has been a most traumatic time"".  Her response was informed by her experience of the applicant during the trial:  ""Mr Linney presented as very aggressive and very vocal in the court room and I was never comfortable staying in the court after Judge had left"". 
16The applicant was arrested in Queensland on 4 May 2012.
The proceedings on sentence
17The applicant pleaded guilty in Central Local Court on 26 June 2012 and was committed to the District Court for sentence.  Sentence proceedings commenced before his Honour Judge King SC on 30 August 2012 and effectively concluded with judgment being reserved.  However, at some stage shortly thereafter a view was reached that because of the identity of the victim it was inappropriate that a judge of the District Court sentence the applicant.  
18The Chief Justice gave his concurrence to the proceedings being transferred to the Supreme Court.  In the light of the history of the proceedings, Bellew J was at pains to bring about a resolution expeditiously.  There was some slight delay caused by a need to obtain a further psychiatric report but ultimately his Honour received evidence and submissions on 10 December and passed sentence on 14 December 2012.
The applicant's evidence
19The applicant gave evidence before King DCJ and a transcript of it was provided to Bellew J.  
20He said that he and his family moved from Emerald Beach to Dayboro, a little north-west of Brisbane, in 2007.  In 2012, he was working in a mine near Mackay.  He would spend 10 days a fortnight there, working for 4 days, having 2 days off but remaining there, then working another 4 days before returning home for the balance of the fortnight.  He took a laptop computer with him to Mackay so that he could keep in touch with his family via Skype.  On his days off he would sit in his donga (a prefabricated modular home often used in mining villages) ""stewing over what we had been subjected to"" or ""fuming"".  The result of the proceedings was financially disastrous for the applicant and his family and he had been made bankrupt.
21The applicant's evidence was that he had no intention of carrying out the threats made in the emails.  He did not know where the judge, or counsel for the plaintiffs, lived.  He said he regretted sending the emails and described them as ""brainless"".  He appreciated that they would have caused concern but added, ""it's all through just sheer frustration in my head of what has progressed in the last seven years"".  In response to leading questions from his counsel he indicated that he was apologetic towards the judge and his associate and was willing to apologise to the plaintiffs' counsel.
22After a series of questions in cross-examination, the applicant eventually, albeit reluctantly, said that the reference to ""Judge Opas"" reflected an intention to convey to the judge a threat to his life.  He said he appreciated the emotional response the judge would have experienced but then added, ""I just thought he needed to understand how he destroyed me"".
23The applicant was asked about the threat in the 14 April: ""Maybe you should start digging your own hole. You will rot in hell much quicker and earlier than you anticipate"".  He explained, ""I wanted him to feel how I had been feeling"".
24It is abundantly clear from the applicant's evidence overall that he still harboured feelings of having suffered a grave injustice.  It is also clear that not only did he ""have a grudge against"" the plaintiffs but he also felt wronged by the judge: for example, ""he was totally disrespectful to me. I wanted to show him how I truly felt in what had happened to us"".
The applicant's account to others
25The applicant told the author of the Pre Sentence Report that after the judgment had been delivered ""he was angry and frustrated at the judicial system, claiming he was not afforded a fair hearing.  He stated that it was this anger that lead to the commission of the offence"". It was the author's opinion that the applicant ""failed to accept the gravity of his actions"".
26Dr Scott Clark, forensic psychiatrist, reported that the applicant did not feel that he was treated fairly by the judge; the plaintiffs' lawyer was corrupt; and that he intended to seek further legal advice and wished to prosecute the judge, the police, and his neighbours.  He wanted a retrial.  But the applicant had also described the emails as ""stupid and impulsive"" and said that he had no intention of hurting anyone.
27Bellew J referred to the evidence of the applicant's partner, Ms Tanya Morris.  She referred to him having suffered a nervous breakdown in 2009 as a result of the litigation and the financial cost.  She subsequently observed him to suffer from stress, sleepless nights and depression.  He was taking anti-depressant medication but he had managed to stop drinking alcohol. She observed him to be still suffering from depression at the time the judgment was delivered.  She said ""the reality of losing the case, the family home to bankruptcy and some possessions was taking a toll on him"".
Assessment of the seriousness of the offending
28Bellew J observed (at [31]) that it was inevitable that an unsuccessful litigant will be affected in some way by the adverse outcome and would, at the very least, be disappointed.  He also noted that it is unfortunately the case that an adverse outcome may be to the financial detriment to the unsuccessful party.  But, his Honour continued:
[32]  Whilst these circumstances, and those referred to by Counsel as forming the background of the offending in the present case, might go some way to explaining the context in which such offending occurred, under no circumstances can they excuse such offending, much less justify it.  No amount of disappointment, no amount of frustration with the judicial process, and no financial consequence however significant, could ever excuse or justify conduct of the kind in which the offender engaged in this case. 
29In response to statements in testimonials by Ms Morris and another person to the effect that sending the emails was the applicant's way of ""venting"", his Honour said (at [34]) that this was to completely ignore the vile, contemptible and confronting terms in which the emails were expressed.
30His Honour accepted (at [35]) a submission that the offending was not planned but also did not regard it as spontaneous, having regard to it involving three emails sent over a period of some weeks.
31His Honour accepted (at [37]) that the terms of the emails would have left the recipient in little doubt that the threats were genuine.  But he concluded (at [38]) that he could not be satisfied one way or the other as to whether the offender intended to carry out the threats; the evidence did not allow him to reach a definitive conclusion on this topic.
32His Honour found it ""unsurprising"" that the stark terms of the threats caused the judge to immediately fear for the safety of himself and his family.  He concluded (and this is relevant to ground 2 of the proposed appeal) (at [40]):
Irrespective of whether the offender did not intend to act upon the threats, the emotional harm to his Honour consequent upon such threats being made was clearly substantial.  That is an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act [1999].
33It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that at the time of the offending he lacked an appreciation of the gravity of his conduct.  After a brief review of the evidence relied upon in support of that submission his Honour rejected it (at [44] and [46]):
What the offender did, in blunt terms, was threaten a judicial officer with death.  He did so in terms that were specific, stark and chilling.  In my view, even when full regard is had to the offender's psychiatric issues ... it is inconceivable that he lacked an appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct.
...
It is clear that in sending the emails, and quite apart from their terms, the offender intended to convey, to Judge Johnstone, a threat to his life.  He intended that Judge Johnstone would interpret what had been written in that way.  I reject the submission that in circumstances where the offender had that intention, he was not aware of the seriousness of what he was doing.  I am satisfied that it was obvious to the offender at the time that such conduct was of the utmost seriousness.
34Similarly, his Honour viewed claims by the applicant to the author of the Pre Sentence Report and to Dr Clark that his offending was ""stupid"" or ""stupid and impulsive"" as indicating that he failed to fully and properly acknowledge the seriousness of his actions ([47]-[49]). 
35His Honour noted (at [51]) that the offending was not isolated but extended over a period of time; it was carried out in the full knowledge by the applicant of the seriousness of his actions; and there was an intention to convey to the judge that his life was under threat.  He concluded (at [53]) that the offence ""falls above the mid-range"" of objective seriousness. (More will be said about this later in the context of one of the grounds of appeal.)
Personal circumstances of the applicant and subjective mitigating features
36His Honour noted a number of features of the evidence concerning the personal circumstances of the offender.  It is not contended that his Honour overlooked or was mistaken about anything in this respect.
37The applicant was 46 years of age.  He had been in a relationship with Ms Morris for the past 15 years and they had three children aged between 7 and 11.  The youngest and eldest of children had certain medical issues.  Ms Morris had to defer her nursing diploma studies in order to care for the children.
38The judge noted the applicant's employment history; in the three years leading up to the offence he worked as a boilermaker in the mining industry.  He was described as having a good work history.
39A particular matter to which his Honour had regard was the fact that the applicant's family lived in Queensland.  Because of geographical and financial reasons, Ms Morris had been unable to visit the applicant since he had been taken into custody in May 2012.  It was submitted that this was a mitigating factor in that it rendered the fact of custody more onerous for the applicant.  This submission was accepted and the matter was taken into account in the applicant's favour.
40An allowance of 25 per cent was made for the applicant's early plea of guilty in the Local Court in recognition of its utilitarian value.
41His Honour accepted that the applicant did not have a significant record of criminal convictions and that he was of prior good character, although he noted that some of the testimonial evidence in support of the latter proposition was qualified by the authors tending to diminish the seriousness of the offending.
42His Honour declined to accept a submission that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and was unlikely to re-offend.  This is the subject of ground four of the proposed appeal and will be discussed more fully in that context.
43His Honour rejected a submission that the applicant was genuinely remorseful.  His claims in this respect were regarded as no more than expressions of regret. The applicant raises no complaint about this.
44The offender's mental state was the final subjective matter discussed by his Honour in his sentencing remarks.  He said, ""the offender's mental state is a matter of some significance in determining the appropriate sentence"" (at [88]). 
45The applicant had previously been prescribed anti-depressant medication during the course of the civil litigation with his former neighbour.  He had been placed on this type of medication again after coming into custody.
46Dr Clark's second report included an opinion that the applicant had ""personality problems of a paranoid nature, and he appears to be highly vulnerable to loss and abandonment"".  Continuation of the applicant's abstention from drug or alcohol use was recommended as they ""could exacerbate personality problems as well as depression"".  His Honour also quoted from Dr Clark's second report:
Mr Linney will benefit from psychiatric review and psychotherapy to assist him to deal constructively with his problems and manage his anger and frustration.  He remains on antidepressant medications and, following further contact with a psychiatrist, the use of low-dose antipsychotic medication may be recommended.
47Despite there being no submission made on the applicant's behalf, his Honour was prepared to accept (at [94]) that considerations of general and specific deterrence, whilst important in such a case, were of ""less significance than might otherwise have been the case had the applicant's mental state been different"".
Assessment of sentence
48Bellew J concluded that no sentence other than one of imprisonment was appropriate: s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.
49He concluded that such a sentence should exceed two years and so was compelled, for that reason alone, to reject a submission that the sentence should be suspended: s 12 of the same Act.  He had regard to the principle that a sentence must not reflect undue weight to an offender's subjective circumstances and result in something that is not reasonably proportionate to the gravity of the offence, citing R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354 and R v GWM [2012] NSWCCA 240 at [136] per Johnson J.
50His Honour did, however, find that there were special circumstances which warranted a reduction of the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period.  These comprised the applicant's ""psychological state and the need for him to have an extended period of release which is subject to medical and other supervision"" (at [102]).
51In the end, his Honour reiterated the seriousness of the applicant's offence (at [103]-[105]).  He remarked that an offence against s 326(1)(b) is, by its nature, serious; it strikes at the heart of the administration of justice.  He said that to do other than impose stern punishment would fail to have proper regard to the authority of the courts which, in turn, would undermine the administration of justice.  For that reason such conduct should be appropriately denounced in order that the authority of the courts is vindicated rather than undermined.  The applicant raised no criticism of those remarks in this Court.
Grounds of appeal
52Four grounds of appeal were relied upon.  The first involves a contention that the sentence is manifestly excessive and in relation to it the applicant relies upon submissions made in support of the other grounds.  For that reason I will deal with that ground last.
Ground 2 The sentencing judge erred in treating as an aggravating factor, in the absence of any victim impact statement or other sufficient evidence, that the emotional harm, to the victim of the offence, was substantial.
53The applicant submitted that ""there was no victim impact statement from Judge Johnstone in evidence at the sentence proceedings"".  In order for emotional harm suffered by a victim of an offence to amount to an aggravating factor, it has to be both ""substantial"" and more than would be expected from an offence of the kind committed.  
54These submissions were made with reference to s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act which provides that it is an aggravating factor if ""the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial"".  
55Reliance was also placed upon King v R [2010] NSWCCA 33 in support of a contention that any harm caused in this case was not beyond what would be expected from an offence of its kind.  A discussion of that proposition appears in my judgment in King v R, with whom Grove and Simpson JJ agreed, at [34]-[35]. I referred to various cases in this Court where it had been found that a sentencing judge had erred by taking into account as an aggravating factor a matter that is an inherent characteristic of an offence, or a particular class of offence.   I also referred to the recognition that a factual matter that may be an element of an offence, or an inherent characteristic of it, may be present to a greater degree than is necessary to establish the element, or that is normally a characteristic of the offence, and so may legitimately be taken into account as an aggravating factor. 
56At the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant clarified that the point sought to be made under this ground was that it was not so much the absence of evidence of harm itself, but that there was an absence of evidence that it was ""substantial"".  It was submitted that the statement of Johnstone DCJ only established that he was ""extremely concerned"" and ""extremely upset"" and that this was insufficient to establish harm of a substantial kind.  Here, unlike other cases where substantial emotional harm has been found, there was no evidence of the victim having to seek out counselling or psychiatric assistance.
57There are three responses to made in dealing with this ground.  First, emotional harm is not an inherent characteristic of the offence in s 326.  The offence involves threatening to do or cause, or actually doing or causing, injury or detriment.  The injury or detriment can be at any level of gravity. Threatening to let down the tyres on a judicial officer's car would be a ""detriment"" caught by the section but it would not necessarily give rise to emotional harm. And as Ms Wilson, senior counsel for the Crown, submitted, it is at least theoretically possible for a threat to cause injury or detriment to be punishable notwithstanding it was not even communicated to the putative victim.
58Second, whether there was substantial emotional harm caused by the applicant's offending conduct is a question of fact.  I am not persuaded that it was not open to Bellew J to find, on the material contained in the judge's statement, that the aggravating factor was established beyond reasonable doubt.  In fact, I think it would be perfectly understandable that even the most emotionally robust judge might be terrified by explicit death threats from a disgruntled and volatile litigant, particularly when they are accompanied by statements indicating the litigant knew where the judge lived with his wife and two of his children.  
59Third, the aggravating factor in s 21A(2)(g) does not require there to be long term psychological damage for it to be established.  There is no requirement for there to be evidence of a victim requiring counselling or psychiatric care.
60Ground 2 should be rejected.
Ground 3 The sentencing judge erred in failing to take into account or did not give sufficient weight to relevant considerations which ought to have mitigated the otherwise appropriate penalty.
61Four ""relevant considerations"" were identified in the expression of the ground.  They were (a) that any term of imprisonment would be more burdensome because his family lived in Queensland and had been, and would be, unable to visit; (b) that the applicant underwent sentence proceedings in the District Court before they were aborted and the case transferred to the Supreme Court; (c) that the applicant did not have a significant record of previous convictions; and (d) that his mental state was such that general and specific deterrence were of less importance than they otherwise would be.
62The contention that the judge ""failed to take into account"" these matters was abandoned; it being accepted that his Honour considered each of them. The first, third and fourth matters were each accepted by his Honour to be mitigating factors.  As to the second matter, his Honour said (at [60]) that he had regard to the delay in the sentence proceedings by virtue of the transfer from one court to another.  But he considered it was something that was ""deserving of very little weight"" on account of there being an ""absence of evidence of its precise effect upon the offender"".
63Counsel for the applicant contended that the point sought to be made was that the sentence was manifestly excessive having regard to these, and other, matters. It was effectively conceded on the hearing of the application that this ground on its own could not succeed.  Such a concession was appropriate when one recalls the often cited statement of Spigelman CJ in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [111]:
Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge.  The circumstances in which matters of ""weight"" will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.
Ground 4 The sentencing judge erred in declining to find the Applicant was unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation.
64Bellew J discussed matters relevant to the applicant's prospects of re-offending and of rehabilitation at length (at [71]-[79]).  He considered that there was ""some force"" in the submission by the applicant's counsel that certain matters supported favourable findings as to these mitigating factors.  
65However, his Honour then referred to evidence that indicated that the applicant had not ""moved on with his life"", contrary to the evidence of his wife.  He had told Dr Clark that he wanted to ""prosecute"" Judge Johnstone and the author of the Pre Sentence Report noted that he continued to question the judge's integrity. There was also the statement the applicant made to the latter to the effect that he proposed to cease his medication regime when released from custody.  The applicant had said something to the contrary in his evidence before King DCJ but Bellew J remained concerned nonetheless.  He concluded:
[79] In my view, the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are largely dependent upon him abandoning the intentions he originally expressed to Dr Clark about pursuing various matters associated with the earlier proceedings, adhering strictly to any medication regime which might be put in place for him and undergoing psychiatric review. On the evidence before me, significant issues arise at least as to the first and second of those matters. In these circumstances, I am not able to come to any positive conclusion about the offender's prospects of rehabilitation or his likelihood of re-offending.
66Counsel for the applicant submitted that Bellew J ""did not have regard to the position that the offence was committed by a person at the end of his tether and that when in that position the Applicant committed the offence by sending the threatening emails.  Those matters were very unlikely to be repeated.""  
67It was also contended that the judge had failed to take into account, in this context, that the applicant was of prior good character, had no significant record of convictions, had a supportive family, and had employment.  
68The judge was not persuaded that the applicant was genuinely remorseful. He said, in that context (at [86]), that what the applicant had said was ""little more than an expression of regret"". In this Court it was submitted that ""regret"" was ""very relevant"" to the question of the likelihood of re-offending and prospects of rehabilitation in the context of a 46-year-old man of good character who had been in custody for the first time for more than seven months at the time of sentence.
69This ground, like the second, challenges findings of fact by the sentencing judge.  I readily accept that it would have been open to his Honour to have found in the applicant's favour in respect of these two mitigating factors (although personally I consider that doing so would have been generous).  But the important point is that, the evidence was not all one way and such a conclusion was not the only one available to be drawn.
70It is implicit in the remarks on sentence that his Honour was aware that the applicant had offended when ""at the end of his tether"".  But there was little to provide comfort that he would not offend if he found himself again in such a state.
71His Honour only referred to statements by the applicant contained in the psychiatric and Pre Sentence reports.  He could also have referred to some things the applicant said in his evidence before King DCJ.  While professing to be apologetic to the judge, the applicant also conveyed that he remained critical of the judge and disgruntled over his judgment.
72The applicant bore the onus of establishing these mitigating factors on the balance of probabilities.  In my view, it was well open to Bellew J to conclude that they had not been established.
Ground 1 The sentence is manifestly excessive
73To succeed on this ground the applicant must establish that the sentence imposed was ""unreasonable or plainly unjust"": Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at [25] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ.
74Bellew J accepted a number of matters in the applicant's favour.  In summary, they were that he had no significant record of previous convictions; he was of prior good character; he had overcome alcohol and substance addictions; he would serve his sentence in more onerous circumstances because his family, who were supportive of him, lived in Queensland; and that general and specific deterrence were less important than they otherwise would be on account of his mental condition.
75An allowance of 25 per cent was made for the utilitarian value of the applicant's plea of guilty.
76Is the starting point of 5 years unreasonable or plainly unjust when considered against the statutory guidepost of a maximum penalty of 10 years when regard is had to the various matters the judge took into account in the applicant's favour? 
77It was conveyed to counsel before the hearing of the application that the Court was interested to hear submissions as to the following passage of the sentencing remarks in the light of the range of conduct encompassed by s 326(1):
[52] There is necessarily a wide range of threatening behaviour encompassed by the section which creates the offence. Towards the higher end of the scale such behaviour might include, for example, a face to face threat made with the use of a weapon. At the lower end of the scale, the behaviour might manifest itself in a spontaneous threat of harm, as opposed to death.
[53] The objective seriousness of the present offending falls somewhere between those two extremes. In my view, taking into account all of the matters to which I have referred, it falls above the mid-range. (Emphasis added)
78Counsel for the applicant had submitted that his Honour should find that the objective seriousness of the offence was ""mid-range, if not a little above"".  The Crown Prosecutor (who did not appear in this Court) responded by submitted that ""it would be in the middle of the mid-range, in the middle from the mid-range to the high range"".  I confess to be confused about what that meant.
79It is appropriate to look at the terms of s 326(1). It provides:
(1)  A person who threatens to do or cause, or who does or causes, any injury or detriment to any person on account of anything lawfully done by a person:(a)  as a witness or juror in any judicial proceeding, or(b)  as a judicial officer, or(c)  as a public justice official in or in connection with any judicial proceeding, is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.
80Counsel for the applicant submitted in this Court that his Honour had erroneously confined his consideration of the criminality dealt with by the provision to threatening behaviour and had omitted to consider that that an offence will be more serious if it involves actually doing or causing injury or detriment. Accordingly, the assessment of objective seriousness should have yielded a conclusion that it was below mid-range.  He accepted that his submission at first instance had been based upon the same erroneous confinement.
81It was submitted that, in addition to the various favourable subjective matters, this aspect provided further support for the proposition that the sentence was manifestly excessive.
82The Crown's response was to submit that it should not be concluded that his Honour overlooked the fact that the section was concerned with both threatening and doing or causing injury or detriment.  His Honour's assessment set out above involved a consideration of comparable conduct caught by the section, namely behaviour that was threatening.  Senior counsel accepted as a general proposition that, ordinarily, threatening harm would be less serious than causing harm, but submitted that the range of conduct that could amount to the offence was wide so this was not always the case. 
83Threats of harm might be made but with the offender obviously having no ability to carry them out.  Injury or detriment might actually be caused but could be quite superficial in nature.  At the other end of the scale, there would be a practical limit on the extent of injury that might be caused before the offender would be prosecuted for a more serious offence.
84So, the Crown submitted that the present case was correctly characterised by the sentencing judge in terms of its objective seriousness.  There were threats of death; they were not spontaneous and were repeated; and they were made in circumstances where the recipient was given real cause to fear that they could be carried out.  It was submitted that as far as threats to a judicial officer might go, these were ""at the very highest end of the range"".
85The Crown submissions should be accepted.  I do not accept that his Honour inadvertently overlooked the fact that the offence can involve doing or causing injury or detriment as well as threatening to do so.  
86I emphasised the word ""threatening"" in the passage set out above from paragraph 52 of the sentencing remarks to highlight that his Honour was considering ""threatening behaviour encompassed by the section"".  The submissions for the applicant would have force if his Honour had simply referred to ""behaviour encompassed by the section"" and then proceeded to give examples at either extreme of threatening conduct.
87Once it is accepted that the characterisation of the seriousness of the offence was not attended by error and was one that was open to his Honour to make, as I believe it was, the conclusion must be reached that the sentence is not manifestly excessive.  All of the favourable subjective matters identified in the applicant's submissions were considered and taken into account.  The applicant had the benefit of the allowance for his plea of guilty and the further allowance of a reduced non-parole period following his Honour's finding of special circumstances.
88The sentence was undoubtedly a severe one to pass upon a person of the applicant's background and personal circumstances.  But his conduct, amounting as it did to a direct attack upon the administration of justice, called for a severely denunciatory sentencing imposition. 
Orders
89I propose the following orders:
1.  Leave to appeal against sentence granted.
2.  Appeal against sentence dismissed.
90ADAMSON J:  I agree with R A Hulme J.

2705907,R v SPIROULIAS [2013] NSWDC 292,"Sentence

1HIS HONOUR: Andrew Spiroulias appears today for sentence in relation to two offences contrary to s 25A(1) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The offences that he pleaded guilty to at the Local Court were, firstly, that he between the 22nd day of December 2011 and the 20th day of January 2012 at Neutral Bay in the State of New South Wales did on three or more separate occasions during a period of 30 consecutive days supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis, to wit, heroin, for financial or material reward. That is Sequence 1. In sentencing the offender in relation to sequence 1, I am to take into account a number of matters on a Form 1 which I will refer to shortly.

2Sequence 2 is an offence, contrary to s 25A, alleging that the prisoner between the 21st day of January 2012 and the 9th day of February 2012, between Neutral Bay and Dee Why in the State of New South Wales, did on three or more separate occasions during a period of 30 consecutive days supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis, to wit heroin, for financial or material reward.

3Each offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and or a fine of 3,500 penalty units, there is no standard nonparole period for that offence. The matters on the Form 1 for which the offender has admitted his guilt and are to be taken into account in relation to the Sequence 1 matter are all offences arising out the circumstances of his arrest on 9 February 2012. They are offences of resisting police, possessing 0.15 grams of methylamphetamine a prohibited drug, dealing with suspected proceeds of crime in the sum $157.85 and having goods in his custody reasonably suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained, to wit, one diamond. The facts of those matters I will refer to in a moment.

4I have been provided with are described as 'Facts on the Sentence' of which the prisoner's counsel referred to as 'agreed facts'. They are not signed by the prisoner but they have not been disputed and the prisoner has not given any evidence to dispute the facts. The background of the offending with which I am concerned is that Manly Detectives in December 2011 set up a strike force to investigate the supply of prohibited drugs within the Manly and Northern Beaches Peninsula. It is clear that they quickly targeted the prisoner, hence the lawful interception of a number of telephone calls made by him which are very much the basis of the prosecution. In fact between 22 December 2011 and 9 February 2012 the prisoner's mobile phone services were targeted and hence the particulars in the charges represent the period of time over which the telephone interception occurred.

5During the relevant time the prisoner used four different mobile service and two of those mobile phones, or those SIM Cards, were in his possession at the time of his arrest. The particulars of the four telephone services are set out in the facts and I need not reiterate. The conversations that were lawfully captured, as the facts state, involve the prisoner discussing with other people, about the supply of heroin.

6It is accepted in the facts that the prisoner during this particular period of time had an addiction to cocaine and methylamphetamine, and in some conversations or in one particular conversation, the facts do not make it clear, the prisoner said that he was using too much cocaine and it was costing him money. He also complained of going on methylamphetamine benders which would cost him money because he could not answer his customers calls. The facts state that the prisoner indicated that he would not sell cocaine or methylamphetamine and would concentrate on his 'work', his work being the supply of heroin.

7The prisoner is said to have frequently caught public transport to Redfern, Sydney CBD and Cabramatta in order to source heroin and other drugs, and he often purchased drugs in what are described as halfball or ball quantities, that is, 1.75 grams and 3.5 gram quantities.

8The first ongoing supply offence which I have already outlined involved him and a female associate assisting him in the supply of customers, at least between 22 December and 28 December 2011. In this time he made up a number of packages of heroin in amounts of 0.05 grams, 0.1 gram, 0.2 grams in quantities of up to 0.4 grams.

9He was in constant communication with the associate and gave her the prepackaged heroin to sell to customers. He spoke to purchasers directly and then gave her directions about what sort of drugs the purchasers wanted to buy and where she should meet them to handover the packages. A number of code words were used between the prisoner and his associate in relation to, first of all, the description of different drugs and then, the quantities that were sold which I need not again reiterate here.

10Annexed to the statement of facts are the list of what are described as transactions conducted by the prisoner covered by the first charge. During this time he made a number of sales as is self-evident. On 23 December, for example, he made 28 sales to various purchasers. Quantities sold during the period range between 0.05 grams to 0.2 grams. He is not charged with any offences relating to the sale of cocaine.

11During this period the prisoner supplied an approximate total of 22.15 grams of heroin for approximately $20,500. At the end of December, during the course of the commission of the Sequence 1 offence, the prisoner and his associate had a disagreement and she stopped distributing drugs on his behalf. I am informed that she was to appear for arraignment at the Sydney District Court on 23 August 2013 which coincidentally was the date that Mr Spiroulias first appeared before me. I am given no particulars in relation to her and it is quite clear from the facts that she was working at his direction, albeit, that she was assisting him.

12The second offence in time, that is the Sequence 2 offence followed the same pattern. The prisoner used code words in telephone conversations with purchasers. If I may quote from para 14 of the facts, in one conversation the prisoner said, ""If I get pinched again, I'm gone"" and on 28 January 2012 the prisoner had a conversation where he said he did not like to supply drugs of poor quality and is quoted as saying, ""I've been in this industry, mate, for a fucking very long time, mate, and I'm not stupid, you know what I mean."" Again, an annexure is attached to the facts setting out the transactions conducted by the prisoner, this time without assistance, as was the case for part of the offending covered by Sequence 1.

13On 31 January 2012 he made 17 sales to various purchasers. Quantities of heroin sold during the period range between 0.05 grams and 0.04 grams. He is again not charged with any offences relating to the sale of cocaine. During this period the prisoner supplied an approximate total of 14.45 grams of heroin for approximately $14,000.

14On 1 February 2012 a purchaser was arrested by police as part of this operation to identify the drug. The purchaser was in possession of a bag containing heroin.

15On 8 February 2012 another purchaser was stopped by police in the Dee Why area and after purchasing a particular item from the prisoner the purchaser was found with two bags of ""heroin"" in his sock. He said to police that he paid $300 for it. On his phone there were text messages between he and the offender on one of the mobile phone numbers I have already set out. For the two month period covered by the charges, or slightly less than two months, the prisoner supplied a total of approximately 36.6 grams of heroin for an amount of $34,500.

16Paragraph 19 of the 'facts' states;

""The offender himself in telephone intercepts stated that he made $2,000 a day from the sale of prohibited drugs. He also stated that he brought a $15,000 watch and expensive sunglasses and he was able to pay $1,600 a week rent when doing well.""

17The Form 1 offences arise out of his arrest at 4.30pm on 9 February. The prisoner got into a gold Nissan sedan on York Street, Sydney, sat in the front passenger seat with the male associate driving and there he purchased some methylamphetamine. He got out of the car and entered a hotel in Jamison Street, Sydney and walked towards the toilets. The police found the prisoner in the cubicle of the female toilets in the hotel and he was seated on the floor in his underpants and attempting to smoke methylamphetamine. Police announced themselves and attempted to enter to locked toilet cubicle, the prisoner placed both legs against the door to stop them entering. He then dropped a clear resealable bag and a rolled up $5 note into the toilet bowl and attempted to flush the toilet while kicking his feet at police. Three police officers were required to forcibly subdue him and remove him from the toilet cubicle, that's the offence of resisting police.

18The police located a clear resealable bag with clear crystals in the bag. The bag was water damaged and most of the contents dissolved. The prisoner admitted to being in the toilet to smoke the methylamphetamine and was about to smoke it when police entered. The contents of the small bag that could be recovered from the floor were analysed by the Division of Analytical Laboratories and found to contain 0.15 grams of methylamphetamine.

19The prisoner was also in possession of a clear stone wrapped in aluminium foil which ""looked like a diamond."" When questioned about this the prisoner said, ""Found it on the street."" He gave no explanation as to why he was in his underwear and he continued his lack of cooperation when he got to the police station when he exercised his right to silence and declined to be interviewed.

20The prisoner was born on 20 November 1975. He will thus turn 38 at the end of this month. He has a criminal history that goes back to 1994 and it must be said at the outset that his criminal history does not entitle him to any leniency, although, it must also be said, judging from the jurisdictions in which he has appeared and the sentences imposed, that the matters with which I am concerned now are the most serious offences for which he has been convicted. 

21He first appeared at the Sutherland Local Court in 1994 and was convicted of common assault and offensive language for which he was fined. He then, in the same year, was convicted of malicious damage and offensive language. In 1995 he was convicted of driving in manner dangerous, resisting arrest, malicious damage, and also convicted of driving whilst licence cancelled in an earlier time in 1994. In 1996 he was convicted of offences relating to the possession of a prescribed restricted substances, possession of a prohibited drug, cultivating prohibited plants and possession of prescribed restricted substances which were offences taken into account on a Form 1 when he was dealt with in the District Court. He was dealt with in the District Court in 1997 for supplying a prohibited drug on a bench warrant and he was sentenced to three months imprisonment. I have no details of what drug was supplied directly from him.

22I note, although the criminal history is almost unintelligible, that he had a matter of supplying a prohibited drug, apparently taken into account on a Form 1 with the other matters I have identified. He was convicted in July 1997 for causing injury with intent to influence a witness and sentenced to a minimum term of nine months with an additional term of 15 months. Apparently there were other matters taken into account on a Form 1. He was convicted of driving offences in the early part of the century, including drive in a manner dangerous or a speed dangerous to the public. He was again convicted in 2004 of driving in a manner dangerous or a speed dangerous to the public. He was convicted of possessing prohibited drugs and possessing restricted substances in 2004 and having goods in his custody suspected of being stolen or unlawfully obtained in 2006 for which he was imprisoned.

23At the Manly Local Court he was sentenced on 13 May 2008 for being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence. He received a period of imprisonment of 20 months with a nonparole period of nine months and he was ordered to undertake residential drug rehabilitation as directed by the Probation and Parole Service. He had earlier, three months before, been convicted of making knowingly false or misleading statements and dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime for which he was sentenced to six months imprisonment.At the Manly Local Court he was also convicted of common assault and sentenced to 12 months imprisonment.

24At Hornsby Local Court in April 2011 he was convicted of possessing a prohibited drug and supplying a prohibited drug for which he was respectively sentenced to six months imprisonment. He was also convicted of dealing with property suspected to be the proceeds of crime and sentenced to six months imprisonment. They are the fingerprinted matters. The nonfingerprinted matters include convictions for common assault in 2006 for which he received a s 9 bond, destroying or damaging property for which he received a s 9 bond. He was convicted in his absence of using a carriage service to threaten to kill another person or other persons, there were nine counts of that offence and he was ultimately sentenced at the Sutherland Local Court to two months imprisonment.

25It is about time that criminal histories were presented to Judges in intelligible fashion and in a chronological order to assist them to summarise the contents.

26The other evidence available to the Court comes from a range of sources. From the Crown I have the Probation and Parole Service report which I believe I requested given the prisoner had previously been on parole. This report deals with a summary of the prisoner's prior periods of supervision. In relation to a previous order for community service I note that it was extended on two occasions and ultimately it was revoked because of Mr Spiroulias's failure to complete the hours required and advise a change of address.

27When he was subjected to a s 9 bond the supervision was deemed to be poor as he did not report on a regular basis. He was under parole supervision in 2008 and 2009. He was described as ""Difficult to work with."" Urinalyses results do not indicate illegal drug use and he ultimately completed the order in a satisfactory manner.

28In the summary of the prisoner having regard to the file information and the interview with the prisoner, the assessment of the Probation and Parole Service officer was that his propensity to illicit drug addiction over a lengthy period of time appears to be the primary contributing factor to his ""Criminogenic"" behaviour. ""He is fortunate to retain the support of his family who may be able to assist him"" (the word 'is' is in the report, but it should be) ""in assimilating back into the community. However, Mr Spiroulias will need to remain vigilant and focussed on addressing the issues that have continued to bring him before the Court if he is to reduce the risk of further adverse attention of the law.""

29It is thought that he would benefit from referral to alcohol and drug assessment and counselling and rehabilitation program, referral for random urinalysis, some psychological evaluation and treatment, particularly targeting the area of ""depression"", monitoring his associations and referral of him to educational employment skills training.

30It is to be noted, of course, the prisoner is 38 years of age and has little in the way of achievement in the way of employment or training. The background of the prisoner, and I am relying now on the account given by the Probation and Parole Service, is that the prisoner started using drugs, he says, when he began working out in a gym and commenced using steroids, he moved to cocaine, amphetamine and has used heroin as well. He told the Probation and Parole Service that when he was arrested February 2012 he was quote ""a mess"". He had a tragedy in his life when he was aged twenty-five years.

31In about 2000 his fiancé of two years passed away as the result of an accident, as I understand it, falling from a building at Rockdale, at Rockdale Plaza. He does not have any children. He hopes to reside with his parents in Bexley, and I note his parents have been in Court supporting him during the course of the proceedings, although for some reason they were not called to give evidence. 

32It is about time counsel appreciated that simply saying the parents are in Court is barely enough to assist the Judge. The Court might have been assisted by some evidence from the parents as to what assistance they can provide the prisoner given his performance over the last twenty years and his criminal conduct and his current circumstances, although I accept that his parents will support him.

33He left school during Year 9 to complete an apprenticeship in panel beating. He did not complete that apprenticeship and he has a number of different employments over the years, usually in short-term casual positions, particularly since his last release from custody. Securing employment, he said, was a priority when he returned to the community. I note that he has been employed in the Industries Complex at Bathurst Correctional Centre for some period of time with 'nil adverse' comments in relation to his work performance.

34He told the Probation and Parole Service he had been assessed as suitable for a particular Probation and Parole program. He is assessed through some form of actuarial assessment system as being of medium risk of reoffending which I think is selfevident from his past performance and identified needs include education, financial support, associations, drug and alcohol problems, emotional and personal issues, and as well as obviously attitude and ""orientation."" I have a drug and alcohol report from Junee Correctional Centre. The prisoner has obviously been moving around the system.

35The Offender Development Officer at Junee said that during interview the prisoner appeared to give honest answers and showed a willingness to change behaviours and establish a better lifestyle for himself, making better more informed choices. He appeared to the writer to be motivated and determined to succeed in his endeavours and it went without saying that the writer recommended that he take drug rehabilitation through residential or some other form and would benefit from the alcohol and other drugs program conducted within the prison.

36There is other information there consistent with the Probation and Parole Service report and I have two reports from two drug rehabilitation programs, one Odyssey House, the other the 'Bridge Program' at the Salvation Army, indicating the prisoner's suitability for admission to residential programs run by those organisations.

37Of course, the material within those letters may be considered in due course by the Parole Authority but one might have thought ultimately that it was more pertinent to considerations of potential release on bail which in this case were not realistic.

38The prisoner produced a report from Mr WatsonMunro. Much in the report does not tell me anything more than the prisoner could have told me from his witness box or his counsel could have told me from the bar table. It sets out some detail of background and social history, some history of his family and some employment history which I have taken into account. It notes his reaction to the death of his fiancé as I referred to earlier and the effect upon him of that but it must be fairly said that his performance in the community since that death reflects little in the way of an attempt by him to address some of the underlying issues that are referred to by the psychologist.

39The psychologist refers to his history of drug addiction or drug use. He claims that the prisoner is now detoxified, which may be so, but does not relieve the prisoner of the burden of having to address the risks that are awaiting when he is released to the outside world.

40The psychologist noted that in the interview the prisoner was ""highly respectful"" and ""cooperative."" He noted no evidence of psychiatric disturbance. To be frank there is no medical evidence whatsoever of any psychiatric or physiological condition perhaps beyond, apart from, 'drug dependence' which explain his offending on this occasion or on these occasions.

41Again, Mr WatsonMunro applied little in the way of psychometric testing. He did administer the Beck Depression Inventory which is a selfreporting questionnaire. But I would be more greatly assisted, as would other Judges, if psychologists would employ the skills that are available to them, particularly the psychometric and other psychological testing that they are qualified to undertake.

42The selfreporting of the prisoner shows symptoms of depression and anxiety. In the previous fortnight before testing one would expect this given the prisoner's current circumstances.

43Mr WatsonMunro states that the prisoner is ""Suffering ongoing depression and anxiety reflected in feelings of expectations of punishment, low selfesteem, feelings of past failure, remorse, sleep disturbance, variation of mood and some cognitive intrusion referrable to concentration and decision-making.""

44However, he notes a renewed sense of optimism, high levels of energy and drive and better orientation leading to insight and its galvanising effect on his desire to move forward with his life.

45He noted, on review, that the prisoner had denied amphetamine psychosis but conceded some paranoia and impaired judgment when using amphetamines, and notes his drugfree status since his arrest and would recommend him to be subject to rehabilitation, and recommended a particular rehabilitation centre in Wyong. However, again, the expectation that he would be released there in September 2013 was somewhat optimistic. I have had regard to Mr WatsonMunro's opinions and given them such weight as they deserve. I note his undertaking of a relapse prevention program in custody.

46I was provided by the Crown, I believe, with a number of statistics relating to the sentencing of offenders in relation to ongoing supply. I have made the comment in the course of submissions, I do not believe they are a complete record of the sentences that have been imposed in the higher Courts and I believe that is refected in one of the judgments that was given to me which provides a very survey of decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal, particularly up until 2010 in relation to s 25A. That is the decision of Gore v R; R v Hunter [2010] NSWCCA 330. I do not believe the sentencing of Gore particularly, as Ms Hunter was more leniently dealt with, provides a comparative sentencing exercise to the matter with which I am concerned. 

47I note he appealed against the severity of a sentence of seven years six months imprisonment with a nonparole period of five years seven months and twelve days in respect of an offence under s 25A taking into account eleven matters on a Form 1.

48The facts in relation to Mr Gore were for supplies over the relevant period involving a total of $700 and a quantity of 2.7 grams, and the Court of Criminal Appeal interfered with the sentence to reduce it substantially to a nonparole period of three years four months with a balance of 14 months taking into account the matters on the Form 1.

49What is useful in the judgment is, apart from of course, the very helpful survey by Justice Adams of general principles relating to the relevance of maximum penalties in sentencing, the requirement of intuitive synthesises laid down by Markarian and the particular authorities relating to the principles to be applied in relation to s 25A matters, is the survey of a number of judgments, again, of the Court of Criminal Appeal for offences of 'ongoing supply' either single counts or multiple counts.

50I appreciate, as was pointed out in the judgment of Gore, noting that Hunt CJ at CL in Morgan had said in 1993, that; ""It is quite wrong to compare the sentence"" at bar with other sentences simply on the basis that offenders may have similar characteristics or may have committed similar crimes. But it is correct as was pointed out in Morgan and was reaffirmed in Gore that prior sentences of comparative offenders and offences provide some 'range' in fixing an appropriate sentence.

51I note what is set out at [46] through to [59] of the judgment, where his Honour refers to cases, without reciting the citations, of Fitzpatrick, Chen, Singh, Hanza, Tran, Smith, Hoon and Pouoa, Khaled, SZ and of course the first decision considering s 25A, Smiroldo, where the former Justice Hulme of the Supreme Court surveyed the legislative policy and the sentences there imposed. I also note his confirmation of the observations of Justice R S Hulme in Smiroldo, particular in [14] to [16], discussing the issue of the relevance of quantity to sentencing.

52Mr Gould who skilfully represented his client's interests, particularly took me to [24] of the reasons for sentence in Gore for reflecting upon what the sentencing judge had found and then to [43], where the Court of Criminal Appeal in considering the case of Barne(?) noted the relatively small amounts of drugs actually supplied in the premises and the fact that the sales were at ""street level amounts"", so that the offender was not trading as a wholesaler.

53I must point out in passing that I was also taken to the decision of Baxter, the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal of 2007 which was in fact an appeal from a decision of mine where I misstated the maximum penalty. The Court of Criminal Appeal in that matter did not change the head sentence but varied the nonparole period on the basis of fresh evidence available to it and did not interfere with any other sentences.

54Essentially, it was submitted on behalf on behalf of the prisoner that the prisoner was a street dealer. It was agreed that taking into account the matters on the Form 1, the first count would require a greater sentence than that for Sequence 2. It was submitted that the quantity of supply was at the lower end of the scale but this needs to be considered in the context of what has been said about that matter in Gore and Smiroldo and other cases.

55I took up with Mr Gould the claims of the prisoner in the conversations he had that were intercepted. It was submitted that the prisoner may have been 'talking up' his success as a dealer. This may be so, but for reasons I will expose in a moment I believe there is an element of truth in the claim he made that in fact his sale of the heroin was contributing to his lifestyle and not just his cocaine and methylamphetamine dependence.

56It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that the profit from the sale of heroin was being spent on the use of cocaine and methylamphetamine solely.

57It was submitted that police had not provided any 'corroboration' of the claims that the prisoner made against his interest. It was submitted on behalf of the prisoner that I should promote his rehabilitation and whilst his record was not encouraging, it was submitted that he was not entitled to leniency, it was a 'shame' that the prisoner could not get access to the Drug Court and the Court should make a finding of 'special circumstances'.

58It was submitted that the relevant aggravating factors that might arise under s 21A were basically those that are implicitly or explicitly confined to the character of the offending.

59The Crown submissions state that it was trafficking to a substantial degree, given the quantities and the amounts of money involved. The prisoner's admission of supplying up to $2,000 worth of drugs on the one day shows that this was not a oneoff activity but a course of conduct. It was in fact his business or his ""work"".

60The Crown submitted that the primary aggravating factor was his record. He was deeply entrenched in the use and supply of drugs and perhaps the Court might find that working with his associate in relation to Sequence 1 provided an aggravation that he was committing the offence in company. For reasons I will deal with in a moment, I do not propose to conclude that his criminal history is a ""aggravating factor"" contrary to s 21A(2). It seems to me, of course, as I have said earlier, it does not entitle him to any leniency but I could not conclude it was an aggravating factor.

61For the same reasons as were discussed in Gore I could not conclude that the Sequence 1 offence, even in part, was committed relevantly in company such as to be an aggravating factor.

62The Crown submitted, I think controversially, that the discount to be given to the prisoner, notwithstanding the plea of guilty at the Local Court, should be 20%.

63It was submitted that there had been unconscionable delay to arrive at the plea of guilty in relation to offences for which he was originally charged and it was submitted on behalf of the Crown that thus the utilitarian benefit of the plea of guilty had been diminished.

64With regard to the timing of the plea, Mr Gould submitted that there may have been a number of factors that may explain the delay and that it would be a matter of speculation for the Court to conclude adverse to the prisoner so far as this discount to be given in accordance with the guideline judgment of Thomson and Houlton. I will not go into the details of what he put, but he noted there may have been delays in obtaining relevant information and the like. He also took up the issue of the claim of profit or a gross profit of $2,000 and pointed out it may have been a peak day, it may have been talking up.

65It is to be borne in mind of course, as I pointed out to Mr Gould, that these were admissions made by the prisoner at a time when he did not believe his calls were being intercepted. In other words, they are statements made against interest when he was disarmed and do not have the same character of selfserving statements made when he knows that they are going to be reported to the Court.

66Whilst it is correct to describe the prisoner as a user dealer, it is an oversimplification, in fact inaccurate, to describe the prisoner as selling prohibited drugs solely for the purpose of obtaining money for the use of drugs himself. There are a number of reasons for this finding.

67Firstly, the prisoner on his own admission was a user of amphetamines and cocaine. He admits this in the telephone intercepts but the prohibited drugs he was selling were heroin. Of course this is not the place, nor do I have the evidence, to be undertaking a comparative analysis of the impact of these prohibited drugs and whether the sale of one drug or another that involves the same level of moral turpitude and the like. But the facts of the matter were that he was selling heroin and using other drugs.

68Secondly, there is no doubt he was substantially involved in the business of selling prohibited drugs in the way that that concept has been discussed in Gip and other decisions, and not simply because he was charged with 'ongoing supply'. I also note other decisions dealing with this issue such as Gu, and Fayd'herbe from the Court of Criminal Appeal in 2006 and 2007. 

69I have seen ongoing supplies of 18 year old Aboriginal kids in hotels in Wagga being asked by undercover police to find 'a point', not even having drugs on them, running off, getting a point, bringing it back, giving it to the undercover officer, doing the same thing three days in a row. This is far removed from that bare minimum of trafficking culpability. The facts reveal the multitude of dealings and substantial sums of cash beyond the money required to purchase the drugs that he used.

70I bear in mind in this respect that the prisoner has not given any evidence in relation to how he used the profits from his sale of drugs. Any hearsay representations made to the psychologist or others have not been subject to the test of crossexamination and must be approached with some circumspection, particularly having regard to the objective reality in the facts of the extent of his dealing and the admissions he made against interests in the course of intercepted telephone conversations.

71This brings me to the third matter, which is the prisoner's admissions during those telephone intercepts. I have already referred to those in summary. The admissions that I referred to are in para 19 of the facts. I also note the admissions the made during telephone intercepts referred to in para 6, where he referred to his abuse of cocaine and methylamphetamine that distracted him from his work, 'which was the supply of heroin' and also the direct quote in para 14 during the course of the second offence where he said, ""I've been in this industry, mate, for a fucking very long time...I'm not stupid, you know what I mean.""

72In relation to the various submissions that I have referred to about these 'facts', I appreciate the point made by counsel concerning the possibility of the accused talking up, so to speak, his business and his accomplishments as a drug supplier. But just from the frequency of sales there is clearly some truth in his admission that he was in the industry or the business of supplying heroin for a profit. While some of this profit was used, no doubt, for the purchase of methylamphetamine and cocaine, he was, on his own admission, applying some of the profits to living and expenses and to what I would loosely describe as ""lifestyle.""

73Of course in sentencing an offender, having regard to this offending, one must keep one's feet on the ground. He clearly was not a wholesaler as that expression has been used in some of the authorities to which I have referred. Sitting in this jurisdiction, clearly the busiest jurisdiction in the Commonwealth of Australia in relation to the issue of drug supply and importation, one is regularly conducting trials and sentencing people involved in the manufacture, supply and or sale of kilograms of prohibited drugs.

74I have presided over at least three trials in the last three years that have involved the importation or the planned importation or the planned importation of hundreds of kilograms of prohibited drug in each instance, primarily cocaine from South America and Mexico.

75That having been said, and accepting that the major distributors take advantage of the weakness of those who are drug dependant to assist them in the distribution of drugs, this prisoner's drug dependency or usage over the relevant period of time covered by the charges did not prevent him coherently and in an organised manner supply heroin. This is exemplified by his multiple use of mobile phones, his use of code, the method and number of sales and supplies of heroin (a drug that he did not use on a regular basis knowing full well the effect of those drugs upon others) and shows his deliberation.

76His own criminal history demonstrates that he would have had an understanding at least of the consequences of illegal drug use either in the promotion of further supplies of drugs by his customers or the commission of other offences in order to obtain the funds to obtain drugs. He knew that if drug dependant and unable to work he could maintain a lifestyle otherwise unaffordable. That is precisely what occurred here. 

77Notwithstanding the terms of s 5, noting the submission was made that I should not impose upon the prisoner a term of imprisonment, I have regard thus to the terms of s 3A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the various purposes of sentencing that arise. These are sometimes said to point in opposing directions. But clearly in the sentencing of offenders for these types offences, given the seriousness of the offending and as a general and personal deterrence loom large, denunciation and punishment, making the prisoner accountable are all relevant matters to take into account.

78The promotion of his rehabilitation, however, is not to be lost sight of, as was pointed out in the decision of Yardley v Betts, adopted in this State in the decision of R v Blackman and Walters. The promotion of the rehabilitation of offenders works to the benefit not just of the offender but for the community. If people are promoted to pursue a lifestyle that turns them away from offending, that is clearly in the interests of the community. In any event, I have taken into account all the relevant factors under s 3A. 

79As I have pointed out, under s 21A there are no specific aggravating factors that arise. I note of course, that, as counsel for the prisoner pointed out, aggravating factors that might be thought to arise are implicitly to be seen as characteristics of this offending. Planning, organisation, financial reward and the like, these are really the very essence of the offending itself and thus fall within the terms of s 21A(4) that the Court is not to have regard to any aggravating factor in sentencing which would be contrary to any act or to do so which includes of course not taking into account any aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence pursuant to s 21A(2). 

80There is little in the way of mitigating factors. I could not conclude that the prisoner is unlikely to re-offend or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation, notwithstanding the contents of the psychological report. The 'proof will be in the pudding' for the prisoner and his past performance does not engender great hope. I accept the prisoner has pleaded guilty. I can not conclude that the prisoner has expressed remorse save for that evidence by his plea of guilty. I have no direct evidence from the prisoner that permits a finding of remorse as a mitigating factor. So far as other aspects of s 21A(3) they are either not relevant or not made out.

81However, I am satisfied in the context of all the evidence that there are special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. There will be a partial accumulation of the sentence for Sequence 2 upon Sequence 1. That itself is a special circumstance. There is a need to adjust the relationship of the non-parole period to the balance of sentence to give the prisoner an extended period of supervision to adjust to community living and to receive supervision in the community to assist him if he is so desirous of pursuing it and drug rehabilitation and counselling. That is a matter for him and I note he has past attempts have been unsuccessful as the facts of this matter establish.

82It might be fairly said of course that the prisoner has reacted to the death of his fiancé in a way which has remained untreated. But, again, he will have to take responsibility for pursuing that matter.

83In sentencing the prisoner I have had regard to a decision of the High Court in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, particularly [45]. I am required to give a specific and appropriate sentence for each matter for which the offender is to be sentenced and then give regard to totality of the criminality and thus assess the extent of accumulation and concurrency as the case may be.

84I have also taken into account the matters on the Form 1, in the way directed by the guideline judgment from 2002, Attorney General's application under s 37 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No 1) of 2002, (2002) 56 NSWLR 146. The focus is upon sentencing the prisoner for the primary offence but the fact that there are matters on a Form 1 are to be taken into account, means that greater weight should be given to personal deterrence and retribution. This has the consequence that the purpose of the process usually, I emphasise the word 'usually' but not always, is to impose a longer sentence than if the primary offence had stood alone and that the additional penalty will not necessarily be small.

85The manner and degree to which the Form 1 offences impinge upon the sentence for the primary offence will depend upon a range of factors and the weight to be given to them in the overall sentencing task. In relation to the effect upon the primary sentence there is no need to specifically distil the extent of that, although that may be reflected in the outcome. It is also the case that a number of authorities have stressed the fact that matters taken into account on a Form 1 do require earnest consideration in the ultimate determination of the sentence for the primary offence. Thus, I have fully taken into account all matters that are required under the legislation and as a consequence of the evidence in the sentencing.

86You can stand up, thank you very much, sir. In relation to the offence, the Sequence 2 offence, that is the second offence in time, you are convicted. The starting point of the sentence is five years imprisonment. I have given you a discount of twenty-five percent. I have noted what the Crown has said but ultimately you were committed for sentence to this Court and I agree with the submissions of your counsel that for me to reduce the discount may involve, on my part, speculation about matters for which no party has sought to produce evidence. In respect of the sentence, thus convicted, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years nine months, that will date from 9 February 2012 and expire on 8 November 2015.

87In relation to the Sequence 1 offence taking into account the matters on the Form 1 the starting point is five years eight months imprisonment, again I have given you a discount of 25% for the utilitarian benefit of the pleas of guilty. The final sentence thus is four years three months. That sentence will date from 9 August 2013, that is 18 months into the sentence for the Sequence 2 offence. In respect of that offence I fix a period of two years three months. The non-parole period to be served by way of imprisonment is two years three months, that will date from 9 August 2013 and expire on 8 November 2013. In other words, the non-parole period expires at the expiry of the sentence in relation to the Sequence 2 offence. I fix a balance of sentence of imprisonment of two years, that balance of sentence will expire on 8 November 2017.

88Total term of imprisonment is five years nine months with an effective nonparole period of three years nine months. I cannot direct that you be released to parole, that will be a matter for the Parole Authority when your non-parole period expires. You can take a seat, thanks very much.

89Yes, Madam Crown, any technical matters from you?

90GARRITY: No, I don't believe so.

91HIS HONOUR: Any matters from you, Mr Ting? Do you understand the sentence I have imposed for Mr Spiroulias? Your non-parole period, effective non-parole period, is three years nine months and it will be a matter for the parole authority whether you are released but if you are released to parole you will have a parole period of two years, you will be subject to the supervision of the parole authority, they will fix the conditions for your parole. They will no doubt have regard to my judgment subject to any rights of appeal of the Crown and yourself. But whatever happens the fact finding of this Court and any other Court will be taken into account by the Parole Authority. Thank you, very much, you are excused. Thank you, gentlemen, very much.

		04 March 2014",2013-11-04 00:00:00,NSW District Court
2705911,Landsman v Director of Public Prosecutions [2013] NSWCA 369,"Judgment
1MACFARLAN JA:  The applicant, Mr Warren Landsman, was tried in the Local Court on 22 May and 13 August 2012 on two charges of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  The applicant's case was conducted upon the basis that the prosecution evidence was not capable of satisfying the Court beyond reasonable doubt that it was the applicant who had assaulted the victims.  
2After the magistrate convicted the applicant of both offences, he adjourned the proceedings to enable the applicant to be assessed for eligibility to serve his sentence in the community by way of an Intensive Correction Order (an ""ICO""; see s 69(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999).  Having been assessed as suitable for it, the magistrate made an ICO.  Thereafter, the applicant exercised his right under s 11(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 to appeal to the District Court against his conviction.
3The evidence upon which an appeal under s 11 against conviction in the Local Court is to proceed is identified in s 18 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act as follows:
""18   Appeals against conviction to be by way of rehearing on the evidence
(1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19.
(2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given.
...""
4Before the appeal was heard, the Crown sought leave to call on the appeal fresh evidence, to be given by Mr Paul Yeomans, a Corrective Services' Officer.  The proposed fresh evidence was outlined in a statement of Mr Yeomans of 26 March 2013.  Mr Yeomans stated that on 8 November 2012 he conducted an interview with the applicant for the purpose of assessing his suitability for an ICO.  Mr Yeomans said that he explained the nature of an ICO to the applicant and said to him, at the commencement of the assessment, ""It's important that you are honest with me regarding your answers as it helps me conduct a thorough assessment"".  Mr Yeomans said that the following exchange occurred during the interview:
""I [s]aid - in your own words, tell me what happened on the night of the offence.He [s]aid - I was at a dress up party.  I bumped into two other guys.  There was a verbal altercation with these two other guys which became physical.  I hit each of the males once.  If sentenced to an ICO I plan to appeal based on severity.""
5Mr Yeomans also said that upon returning to his office he typed a case note which included the following:
""The offender stated that he understood the current charges and agreed with Police facts.  The offender stated that what began as a verbal altercation soon escalated to a physical altercation where he acted first as he thought he was going to be assaulted"".
6In argument in the District Court on the application to call fresh evidence, the applicant's counsel pointed out that Mr Yeomans had not warned the applicant that anything he said might be used against him on his appeal.  He submitted that, although a formal caution such as is given on arrest was not necessarily required, it was unfair that the applicant had been given ""an [exhortation] to say everything without any proviso about what use might be made of it subsequently"" and that that unfairness should lead to the Court refusing to accede to the Crown's application.  
7In granting the Crown leave to adduce the fresh evidence Blanch CJDC made the following remarks:
""It appears to me that what has occurred is that the appellant has simply been honest and made a confession that he was the person who committed the assault.  I have no doubt that he did that on the basis of cooperating with the probation officer bearing in mind that what was in contemplation was either a gaol sentence or a non full-time custodial sentence and it would have been very much in his interests to try to avoid going to gaol.
...
One thing that does need to be looked at is the circumstances in which it arose, and that is whether there is any unfairness or impropriety in what occurred between him and the probation officer.  I see nothing in what occurred to lead to any conclusion about impropriety, it is not a case where the law requires a probation officer to give a warning, the confession seems to have been one that was volunteered in the course of an overall assessment by the probation officer and in my view it is in the interests of justice that the prosecution be allowed to call the material.""
8His Honour noted that the applicant would be given leave to call evidence in rebuttal, including as to an apparent defence of self-defence. 
9On 20 May 2013, the applicant requested that his Honour state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  Prior to the hearing, the applicant identified the following as the form of the question he wished to be stated:
""Did I err in law by holding that, within the meaning of s. 18(2) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, it was in the interests of justice to permit the prosecution to lead fresh evidence at an appeal against a conviction recorded at the Local Court, in circumstances where such fresh evidence consisted of an admission obtained from the appellant, after he had been found guilty, and where such admission was made within the process of assessing whether the appellant was a suitable person to serve his sentence by way of intensive correction in the community?""
10Early in the course of argument on this issue, his Honour said that ""it occurs to me that it's not a point of law at all, but a thinly disguised appeal against the decision which is not open on the stated case procedure"".  The applicant's counsel rejected that proposition and indicated that his submission was that ""the Court was bound to find that it was contrary [to] the interests of justice given the circumstances in which the admission was made"".  Shortly thereafter, he added the following:
""LANGE:  Your Honour, to the extent that perhaps my poor drafting has led to your Honour's comments, perhaps if, without wishing to barter with your Honour, the question were phrased in this way, was I bound to conclude that it was not in the interests of justice when the statements relied upon by the prosecution was made after a finding of guilt and in circumstances where it was made during an assessment for an ICO.  Of course, doing that on my feet.  That then plainly raises a legal question whether there was a threshold[ ] determination in the assessment of whether it was in the interests of justice rather than a balancing act, which your Honour appears to be of the view that that question attacks"".
11In his judgment delivered on the same day, Blanch CJDC noted he had an obligation to state a case unless the application for him to do so was frivolous or vexatious, but that this only applied if the application related to a question of law.
12His Honour then set out the terms of the question identified prior to the hearing (see [9] above) and concluded:
""In my view that is simply an attempt to appeal against the decision that was made.  On the facts of the case it is not a question of law.  It is always open for questions of fact to be attempted to be turned into questions of law by the use of the formula such as 'Did I err in law by holding?'  However, what is in reality sought to be done here is simply to appeal against a decision based on the facts of the case.  In those circumstances I decline to state a question of law, because no question of law arises"".
13By Summons filed in this Court on 3 June 2013, the applicant sought, under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970, an order in the nature of certiorari quashing the decision of Blanch CJDC not to state a case for consideration by the Court of Criminal Appeal.  The applicant contended in his Summons that his Honour erred in concluding that the question posed by the applicant was not a ""question of law"".  In the course of argument in this Court, the applicant recognised that, to succeed, he would have to establish that his Honour committed a jurisdictional error (Kirk v Industrial Court of New South Wales [2010] HCA 1; 239 CLR 531), this being the consequence of the preclusion by s 176 of the District Court Act of other judicial review challenges to the District Court's decisions (Downey v Acting District Court Judge Boulton (No 5) [2010] NSWCA 240; 78 NSWLR 499 at [133] - [134]).
14It is convenient to consider whether his Honour's refusal to state a case involved any error before considering whether that error was a jurisdictional error entitling the applicant to relief from this Court.
THE REFUSAL TO STATE A CASE
15Section 11(1) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 confers a right of appeal to the District Court on a person who has been convicted or sentenced by the Local Court.  Sections 5 and 5AA of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which confer rights of appeal on those convicted in the District Court either on indictment or in its summary jurisdiction, do not extend to determinations by the District Court of appeals to it against convictions or sentences in the Local Court.  As a result, no further appeal lies from such a determination, the general right of appeal to the Supreme Court under s 127 of the District Court Act being inapplicable to the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court (see the definition of ""action"" in s 4).  Section 176 of the District Court Act precludes judicial review of District Court decisions, although, as noted above, decisions infected by jurisdictional error remain open to review.  
16In these circumstances, the ability and duty of a District Court judge to submit to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination any question of law arising in an appeal to the District Court in its criminal (and special) jurisdiction is of considerable importance.  This is particularly so in the present case where the Crown sought to adduce important fresh evidence at the hearing of the District Court appeal.  There is no avenue available to the applicant to have the decision on that appeal reviewed on its merits.
17Section 5B(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act is in the following terms:
""5B   Case stated from District Court
(1)  A Judge of the District Court may submit any question of law arising on any appeal to the District Court in its criminal and special jurisdiction coming before the Judge to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination, and the Court of Criminal Appeal may make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit.""
18District Court judges have a duty to submit a question of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal unless ""the question is so obviously frivolous and baseless that its submission would be an abuse of process"" (Elias v DPP [2012] NSWCA 302; 222 A Crim R 286 at [8] citing Ex parte McGavin; Re Berne (1945) 46 SR (NSW) 58), or adoption of the procedure would otherwise be an abuse of process (Elias at [9]).  Although the parties are entitled to be heard on an application for a case to be stated, ""[u]ltimately it is for the judge stating the case to settle the terms of the case which is stated"" (Lavorato v The Queen [2012] NSWCCA 61; 82 NSWLR 568 at [73]).
19The question that the applicant formulated prior to the hearing of his application in the District Court (see [9] above) and which the judge addressed in his judgment was, in effect, whether it was in the interests of justice for leave to be granted to the Crown to adduce the fresh evidence of Mr Yeomans.  The judge considered this was a question of fact.  On appeal to this Court, the applicant contended that the question was one of law because it required the construction of the expression ""the interests of justice"" which was not an ordinary English term but a technical legal one.
20The applicant relied in this respect upon the third general proposition stated by the Full Federal Court in Collector of Customs v Pozzolanic Enterprises Pty Ltd [1993] FCA 322; 43 FCR 280 at 287 that the ""meaning of a technical legal term is a question of law"" and the High Court's apparent approval in principle of this in Collector of Customs v Agfa-Gevaert Ltd [1996] HCA 36; 186 CLR 389 at 395 - 6 (see also Lombardo v Federal Commissioner of Taxation [1979] FCA 105; 40 FLR 208 at 215).  
21There may have been force in this submission if the issue to which s 18(2) actually gave rise in this case was whether it was in the interests of justice that leave be given to adduce the fresh evidence.  The issue was however whether the judge was satisfied that that was the case, not whether it was the case (compare Corporation of the City of Enfield v Development Assessment Commission [2000] HCA 5; 199 CLR 135 at [33] - [34]).  Determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal of the meaning of the expression ""the interests of justice"" in vacuo would not have assisted the judge in considering that issue because the term is undoubtedly of ""the widest possible reference"" (Herron v Attorney-General for New South Wales (1987) 8 NSWLR 601 at 613).  In these circumstances, there was in my view no duty on him to refer the question to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  Its referral would have been futile.
22During the hearing in the District Court of the stated case application the applicant's counsel did however seek to have the question for referral reformulated (see [10] above) to raise what in my view was a material question of law, that is, whether the uncontested facts before the judge were capable of supporting the judge's view that it was in the interests of justice that the leave sought be given or, to put it as the applicant's counsel did, whether the judge was bound to conclude that it was not in the interests of justice for leave to be given.  As stated by the plurality in Vetter v Lake Macquarie City Council [2001] HCA 12; 202 CLR 439 at [24], ""whether the facts found by the trial court can support the legal description given to them by the trial court is a question of law"".  Their Honours referred in that case with approval to the observations of Jordan CJ in Australian Gas Light Co v Valuer-General (1940) 40 SR (NSW) 126 at 138 that:
""[I]f the facts inferred ... from the evidence ... are necessarily within the description of a word or phrase in a statute or necessarily outside that description, a contrary decision is wrong in law"".
23The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Hammond v R [2013] NSWCCA 93 is a recent example of that Court's consideration of such a question on a stated case (see at [24]).  The position is analogous where the statutory power is conditioned upon the decision maker being satisfied of identified circumstances (R v Connell; Ex parte Hetton Bellbird Collieries Ltd [1944] HCA 42; 69 CLR 407; CHEP Australia Ltd v Strickland [2013] NSWCA 351 at [5]).  The state of satisfaction must be ""such that it can be formed by a reasonable man who correctly understands the meaning of the law under which he acts"" (Connell at 430).  This cannot be so where the facts are incapable of supporting the required state of satisfaction.
24Whilst this was not the question that the applicant formulated prior to the hearing in the District Court, the applicant's counsel in my view sought the reformulation of the question in a sufficiently clear fashion to enliven the judge's duty to refer the reformulated question to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  To assist him, it would of course have been entirely appropriate for his Honour to have required the applicant to produce a written reformulation of the question but his Honour did not do this.
25The reformulated question to which I have referred is in my view arguable and not one whose submission to the Court of Criminal Appeal would be futile.  The alleged admissions of the applicant were made in response to the encouragement of a person in authority, the probation officer, and in a context where it was plainly indicated to the applicant, at least by implication, that from a sentencing point of view his interests lay with complete frankness.  The applicant was not given any warning that what he said might be used against him on an appeal from his conviction, or otherwise.  In my view he is entitled to have determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal the question of whether in these circumstances it was open to the District Court judge to be satisfied that it was in the interests of justice to permit the Crown to lead the fresh evidence of the probation officer on the applicant's appeal.
WHETHER JUDICIAL REVIEW AVAILABLE
26As noted earlier, judicial review for jurisdictional error is available notwithstanding s 176 of the District Court Act.
27In general terms, jurisdictional error occurs ""if the decision maker makes a decision outside the limits of the functions and powers conferred on him or her, or does something which he or she lacks power to do"" (Kirk v Industrial Court at [66] citing Re Refugee Review Tribunal; ex parte Aala [2000] HCA 57; 204 CLR 82 at [163]).  
28The District Court judge declined to state a case for the Court of Criminal Appeal because he did not consider that a relevant question of law arose.  For the reasons I have given above, that was incorrect.  As his Honour was mistaken about the extent of his jurisdiction, that is, he failed to recognise that a question of law had arisen such that he was bound to state a case, an order should be made quashing his decision.  It will be for the District Court to formulate the question to be referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal to reflect the applicant's argument in the District Court to which I have referred in [22] above.  In order to properly reflect the issue raised by that argument, the statement of the probation officer, Mr Yeomans, should be annexed to the stated case.  It records the facts upon which the judge proceeded, these not being disputed for the purposes of the s 5B application (see Hammond v R at [11]).
ORDERS
29For these reasons I propose the following orders:
(1)That the order made by Blanch CJDC on 20 May 2013 refusing to submit a question for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal be quashed.
(2)That the proceedings be remitted to the District Court to be heard and determined according to law.
(3)That the respondent pay the applicant's costs of the application to this Court.
30LEEMING JA:  I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA, and very substantially with his reasons, which enable me to be concise.
31I agree with Macfarlan JA for the reasons which he gives that s 5B of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 imposes an obligation to submit questions of law to the Court of Criminal Appeal unless it would be frivolous or futile to do so.  I agree that there was no duty to submit the question as originally framed by counsel for the applicant.  I prefer not to express any view on whether a question framed by reference to ""the interests of justice"" gives rise to a question of law; as Macfarlan JA points out, the question posed by s 18(2) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 turned upon the primary judge's state of satisfaction.  I agree, again for the reasons given by Macfarlan JA, that the reformulated question (whether the primary judge was bound to conclude that admitting the fresh evidence was in the interests of justice) did give rise to a question of law and that that reformulated question was put forward sufficiently clearly so as to engage the duty under s 5B.
32As Macfarlan JA observes, s 5B is important for the duty it imposes upon the Judge of the District Court, from whose interlocutory or final decisions in the course of hearing an appeal from the Local Court no appeal lies.  It is also important because it appoints the Court of Criminal Appeal to determine that question, and confers power upon that Court to ""make any such order or give any such direction to the District Court as it thinks fit"".  Prima facie, the relief which may be given by the Court of Criminal Appeal exceeds that which is available in the exercise of this Court's supervisory jurisdiction.
33It is relatively common for the same court to have both appellate and supervisory jurisdiction in respect of the same order or conduct.  Many of the principles governing the exercise of those overlapping jurisdictions may be seen in New South Wales Bar Association v Stevens [2003] NSWCA 95 at [11]-[14].  Speaking generally, prerogative relief, which is discretionary, is often refused because the alternative remedy of an appeal is available.  Those considerations are of added force where, as here, the Legislature has provided for questions of law arising out of appeals to the District Court from the Local Court to be determined by the Court of Criminal Appeal, upon which Court a broad power to make orders and give directions has been conferred.  
34Here the primary judge failed to accede to a request under s 5B.  The only recourse available is this Court's supervisory jurisdiction.  The exercise of that jurisdiction is discretionary.  But in my opinion it is inappropriate in this case to accede to the submission advanced by the respondent that relief be refused in the exercise of that discretion.
35Counsel for the applicant advanced essentially two arguments directed to the ultimate question (namely, whether the primary judge was bound to reject the fresh evidence application).  His larger submission was that s 18(2) was not available to the prosecution in any case in respect of evidence obtained after the conviction.  That cannot be so.  Appeals are creatures of statute, and in each case the language of the statute must be the starting point:  Kostas v HIA Insurance Services Pty Ltd [2010] HCA 32; 241 CLR 390 at [89].  The appeal created by s 11 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, whose incidents are specified in s 17 and s 18, may be contrasted with prosecutors' appeals (on sentence), either to the District Court or the Land and Environment Court, in respect of which s 26(2) and s 47(2) of the same Act make special provision for the giving of fresh evidence by the prosecutor, ""only in exceptional circumstances"".  Subsection 18(2) is in marked contrast:  it speaks identically and symmetrically in relation to applications for giving fresh evidence.  Where the same statute expressly qualifies the right to adduce fresh evidence in an appeal by a prosecutor, there is no textual foundation for the applicant's larger submission.
36The applicant's narrower submission was that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Court was bound to find that the interests of justice were not advanced by permitting the fresh evidence to be given.  The difficulty here is the breadth of the term ""interests of justice"".  One aspect of the interests of justice is the important interest served by the ""right to silence"" (more precisely, the disparate group of immunities encompassed by that expression:  see X7 v Australian Crime Commission [2013] HCA 29; 87 ALJR 858 at [40], [105]), which includes the cautious use of admissions obtained from persons in authority.  But the ""interests of justice"" is a very wide term, of which (albeit in a different context) Kirby P has said that ""there could scarcely be a wider judicial remit"":  Herron v Attorney-General for NSW (1987) 8 NSWLR 601 at 613.  The interests of justice are capable of including a broader interest:  permitting the statutory mechanism of appeals to be used appropriately and efficiently.  It might be thought that it would be a large proposition to conclude that it was not possible for the primary judge, correctly applying the law to the facts of this case, to do anything other than to be satisfied that it was not in the interests of justice to permit the giving of fresh evidence.  However, although the merits of that ultimate question were touched on when the application for leave was heard in the course of the parties' submissions on discretion, it was not fully argued.  The structure of the legislation is that it is a matter for the Court of Criminal Appeal, and not lightly ought this Court to accede to a submission which deprives the applicant of his right to have the Court of Criminal Appeal answer that question.  I agree with Macfarlan JA that it should be submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal for determination.  
37I agree with Macfarlan JA that s 176 does not stand in the way of this Court granting relief.  Section 176 of the District Court Act 1973 purports to prevent an ""adjudication on appeal"" from being removed into the Supreme Court.  It has been held that the provision requires jurisdictional error to be demonstrated:  Garde v Dowd [2011] NSWCA 115; 80 NSWLR 620 at [10]; Mahmoud v Sutherland [2012] NSWCA 306 at [7]-[8] and [51] and as much was common ground when the summons for leave was heard.  I agree with Macfarlan JA that by declining to submit a question of law, which, for the reasons given by Macfarlan JA with which I agree, the primary judge was bound to submit, there was jurisdictional error whose review could not be prevented by s 176.
38Finally, it is not entirely clear on the face of the record whether in fact an order was made on 20 May 2013 susceptible of being quashed.  However, an order in the nature of certiorari was sought by the applicant, perhaps out of an abundance of caution, and without opposition in this respect from the respondent.  Accordingly, I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA.
39SIMPSON J:  I agree with Macfarlan JA.

		05 November 2013",2013-11-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Appeal
2705912,Willmott v R [2013] NSWCCA 244,"Judgment
1BASTEN JA:  On 13 October 2010 the applicant, Kelvin Robert Willmott, murdered the deceased, Shane Curphey, at a caravan park on the Central Coast of New South Wales.  The applicant entered a plea of guilty to murder on 6 December 2011 at Wyong Local Court.  He was committed for sentence in the Supreme Court.
2On 20 July 2012 Price J sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 21 years, to commence on 13 October 2010, with a balance of term of seven years: R v Willmott [2012] NSWSC 824.  The period of the sentence was therefore 28 years.  
3The applicant seeks leave to appeal on a single ground, namely that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.  In oral argument, counsel for the applicant accepted that the sentence might well have been within range if imposed after a trial, but was not an appropriate sentence once account was taken of the 20% discount for the plea of guilty, which, as the sentencing judge acknowledged, indicated an undiscounted starting point for the sentence of 35 years: at [40].  In other words, the applicant submitted that the appropriate starting point should have been 28 years, rather than 35 years.  
4Given the severity of the sentence, it is appropriate that there be a grant of leave to appeal.  However, for the reasons set out below, the applicant has not established that the sentence was outside the available range.  Accordingly the appeal must be dismissed.
Legal principles applied at sentencing5No issue arose as to the statement of principles by the sentencing judge.  Thus, he correctly noted that whilst the maximum sentence for murder was imprisonment for life, the Court was authorised to pass a lesser sentence, pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (""the Sentencing Procedure Act""), s 21.  A standard non-parole of 20 years applied to the offence: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 54D.  The judge also noted s 61(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which provides:
61 Mandatory life sentences for certain offences
(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.
6The operation of s 61 was discussed by the Court in R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19; 59 NSWLR 587.  It is not necessary to consider its operation in the present case, as the sentencing judge was satisfied that, although the applicant's level of culpability was ""of a high order"", the test provided in s 61 was not engaged: at [36].  A sentence of life imprisonment was not imposed.
7There was also no issue taken with the application of the aggravating and mitigating factors prescribed by s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, or the judge's findings in respect of relevant factors.  Whilst the sentencing judge treated the fact that the applicant was on parole at the time of the offence as a significant aggravating circumstance, he also ensured, by backdating the commencement of the sentence to the date on which the applicant was taken into custody, that there was no double punishment on that account.
Circumstances of offending8The sentencing judge dealt with the matter on the basis of a statement of agreed facts, which is set out in full in the judgment: at [3].  He accepted the facts as stated: at [4].  It is sufficient for present purposes to note the key elements of the circumstances as they affected the sentencing determination.
9The deceased and the applicant were drinking with two residents of the caravan park, Daniel Curds and Jodie Murray at Mr Curds cabin.  Two events occurred in the course of the afternoon.  The first involved the applicant handing Mr Curds a pre-mixed vodka drink and urging him to ""skull it"".  When he did so, the applicant laughed and said ""I just drugged you"".  It appears that Mr Curds took that comment as a joke, but sometime later passed out on his bed.  (He had been drinking since 8.00 that morning.)  The statement of facts continued:
""10. At some stage the Deceased went to use the toilet in the cabin and noticed CURDS passed out on his bed. The Deceased then asked the Offender if he had slipped anything in CURDS' drink and the Offender replied 'I don't have any drugs'.  Shortly after this, the Offender made a comment toward MURRAY involving calling her a 'slut'. The Deceased said 'You don't have to go talking to women like that' and told the Offender 'Get out'.  The Offender apologised and said 'I'm sorry, I was out of line'.  The Deceased said 'Just make sure it doesn't happen again'. The Deceased then started getting argumentative and asking the Offender again to get out.
11. After some arguing, the Deceased said to the Offender 'we don't hang out with people like you' and told the Offender to get his stuff and get out of CURDS' cabin.  The Offender apologised again and said 'I was out of line'.  The Deceased said 'I don't care I just want you to leave because you're starting to piss me off and if you don't leave I will make you leave'.  The Deceased offered to take it outside' and the Offender and (sic) said 'I don't want to fight, I don't know how to fight'.
12. The Deceased told the Offender if you come back here again you will know about it.  Don't come back here again'.  The Offender picked up his bag and bottle of vodka and went to leave.  The Deceased followed the Offender outside.  The Offender walked away.  The Offender had not behave (sic) aggressively while in the company of the Deceased, CURDS and MURRAY.
13. MURRAY and the Deceased went back inside the cabin.  The Deceased became more agitated and decided he wanted to go looking for the Offender to confront him physically.  After around 20 minutes, he got up and walked out and said 'we'll go for a walk and see where he is'.
14. The Deceased walked through the caravan park looking for the Offender, and approached a male in the park and asked him where the Offender lived.
10This material was significant for two reasons.  First, it involved the first stage of the altercation between the applicant and the deceased and demonstrated that, although the applicant was not entirely without fault, it was the deceased who was, at that stage, aggressive.  Secondly, it demonstrated that the deceased wished at that point to confront the applicant further.
11The next stage of the altercation involved the applicant returning to his mother's caravan, at which time he was ""angry and very agitated"": agreed facts, par 15.  He demanded a sharp knife and said ""they're coming for me in a couple of seconds"": agreed facts, par 16.  
12While it was true that the deceased had been looking for the applicant, it is not entirely clear why the applicant thought he was at risk.  The agreed facts (par 13) did not suggest that the deceased had demonstrated any intention to pursue the applicant at the time the applicant walked away from Mr Curds' caravan.
13Having armed himself with two small steak knives from his mother's cutlery draw, the applicant then went to the caravan of another resident and asked for a ""big knife"": agreed facts, par 19.  He helped himself to a ""serrated kitchen type knife"", later described as a ""paring knife"": agreed facts, par 44.  In response to a question from the resident as to what was wrong, he stated, ""I'm going to go and bash someone"" and ""I'm going to go and fix this bloke up"": agreed facts, par 20.
14At about 5.30pm the applicant approached the deceased and Ms Murray at which stage a further confrontation occurred, described as follows in the agreed facts:
""23. The Offender approached the Deceased and MURRAY and said to the Deceased 'What's your problem?'  The Deceased said 'you drugged my mate' and the Offender replied 'No I was joking about that.  Daniel's my mate too I just came over to have a few drinks with him'.
24. The Offender and the deceased began yelling and swearing at each other.  Several witnesses state that they heard the Deceased say to the offender 'Don't be so gutless' and 'Come on do it, do it', as he pointed to his stomach area.  While this was being said, the offender stood still with his arms crossed behind his back, holding a knife.  The Deceased yelled aggressively at the offender, with his face close to the Offender's.  At one stage the Deceased was pulled 2 to 3 metres away by Jodie MURRAY, but moved back to the Offender and continued yelling at him.  MURRAY then got the Deceased to move away from the Offender and speak to her.
25. The Deceased then approached the Offender again and pushed him with both hands to the front of his chest.  The Offender stumbled back and fell over.  He then got up and produced a knife from behind his back.""
15The applicant then commenced a frenzied attack with two knives upon the deceased.  The sentencing judge found in these circumstances that when he obtained the large serrated kitchen knife, he had formed an intention to inflict serious injuries on the deceased and that when the attack commenced, he had an intention to kill the deceased: at [7].  He stated at [9]:
""I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the deceased's aggression towards the offender provided some provocation, but the attack that followed was far out of any reasonable proportion to the deceased's behaviour.  Furthermore, the offender had caught up with the deceased with the intent to seriously injure him.  I give very modest weight to the deceased's provocation in mitigation of the offence.""
16Further, the sentencing judge was satisfied that the murder was not planned: at [10].  
17The ferocity of the attack was extraordinary: the deceased suffered 105 stab wounds.  The applicant kicked the deceased a number of times whilst he was on the ground and was described by a witness as ""laughing and dancing around the deceased and appeared to be enjoying himself"": agreed facts, par 29.  
18The applicant's mother approached at some stage during the attack, which caused the applicant to desist and speak to her before recommencing the attack.  He was seen to ""walk back and forth between his mother and the deceased, each time stabbing the deceased in the chest and torso, and sometimes kicking him in the head"".  He also tried to cut the deceased's head off, holding it by the hair and slicing at the neck and banging the deceased's head against the roadway.
19The extraordinary ferocity of the attack and the bizarre behaviour which accompanied it raised a question as to whether the applicant was mentally ill.  A report by Dr Olav Nielssen, a consultant psychiatrist, found that he suffered from alcohol abuse disorder, dysthymic disorder (chronic low grade depressive illness) and ""possible"" bipolar mood disorder.  Dr Nielssen's opinion stated:
""The diagnosis of possible bipolar mood disorder is made on the basis of the history of mood swings and the history of treatment with mood stabilizing and antipsychotic medication usually reserved for bipolar disorder.  However, I did not elicit a history consistent with a typical manic episode that would confirm the diagnosis, or find any corroborative descriptions of manic states amongst the medial records provided to support that diagnosis.
It seems that the main reason for the offence was Mr Willmott's state of intoxication and his association with other highly intoxicated people, which added to the risk of an alcohol fuelled altercation.  Mr Willmott reported a heightened perception of threat, which might have been due to the physical presence of the deceased.  It seems he has a pattern of becoming aggressive whilst intoxicated, which would have been increased by the effect of a moderate does of methamphetamine taken several hours before the offence.""
20The sentencing judge gave careful attention to Dr Nielssen's report: at [18]-[21].  He also noted the report of Professor Starmer, a pharmacologist, who estimated that the applicant's blood alcohol concentration at the time of the offending would have been approximately 0.434g/100ml which was described as ""extraordinarily high"": at [22].  However, the judge was not satisfied that the calculation was entirely accurate: at [27].  He noted that, although significantly intoxicated, the extent of his intoxication ""did not prevent him from sustaining a prolonged attack upon the deceased"".  He concluded at [27]:
""The offender's intoxication does not mitigate the seriousness of the murder but assists in providing an explanation for the crime and the horrific manner in which the deceased was killed.  The offender's prior history of heavy drinking and of violent offending whilst affected by alcohol demonstrates that his intoxication was not out of character for him.  He had previously used amphetamines as a young person.  I conclude that his intoxication and consumption of methamphetamine neither mitigates nor aggravates the offence.""
21Noting that counsel for the applicant had not submitted that the psychiatric disorders diagnosed by Dr Nielssen impacted upon the offender's culpability (at [28]), the sentencing judge then turned to the question of future dangerousness.  He concluded at [30]:
""Unless the offender can overcome his alcohol abuse, the risk of future dangerousness that he presents to the community is high.  The risk will moderate naturally with advanced age.  The offender's prior alcohol related offending and return to the heavy consumption of alcohol upon release to parole encourages a pessimistic view being taken of his prospects of rehabilitation and the risk of violent re-offending upon release.  I consider that the offender's prospects of rehabilitation are poor.""
22The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant was genuinely remorseful and took his remorse into account as a mitigating factor: at [32].  
Range of sentence23The applicant was 37 years of age at the time of sentencing.  An undiscounted sentence of 35 years would have expired when he was 72.  There were no reasons to find special circumstances and accordingly the sentencing judge imposed a sentence comprised of a non-parole period and a further term of one-third of the non-parole period, in accordance with s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act.  Applying that proportion to the putative head sentence of 35 years, would have resulted in a non-parole period of 28.5 years, and thus mandatory incarceration until the applicant was 65.5 years of age.  The sentence in fact imposed, allowing the 20% reduction for the plea of guilty, involved a non-parole period of 21 years which will expire on 12 October 2031, when the applicant will be 56 years of age.
24The challenge made to that sentence placed weight on three favourable findings noted by Price J, namely that the offence was not pre-meditated, that there was a significant degree of provocation and that there was evidence of genuine remorse.  Those factors were said to take the case out of the worst class of killing.  On the other hand, the degree of violence was extraordinary, the applicant was on parole following his conviction in Queensland for an assault involving the infliction of grievous bodily harm and he had a record of earlier offences involving weapons and assaults.
25The second limb to the applicant's case involved reference to the Judicial Commission statistics indicating the range of sentences imposed for murder.  For the period from July 2005 until June 2012, 24% of offenders received a head sentence of 25 years or more although it should be noted that 57% received a sentence in excess of 20 years.  Since the introduction of the standard non-parole period of 20 years, some 14% of 126 cases have received a non-parole period greater than 20 years.  (Of these, 5% received a life sentence.)  On the other hand, when the cases involving a plea of guilty are isolated, the figure drops to 4%, being two cases out of 54, one of whom received a life sentence.
26The applicant acknowledged that the bare statistics, without reference to the circumstances of particular cases, would provide limited assistance to the Court.  That submission was correct: Hili v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [53]-[56].  Accordingly, the Court was taken to four cases which, it was submitted, bore similarity with the present case.  Such an exercise was necessary in part because the bald statistics did not of themselves establish that the sentence was outside an appropriate range.  
27Taken chronologically, the first was Regina v Reid [2005] NSWSC 230.  The offender had entered a plea of guilty to murdering his former de facto partner in her own home.  The sentencing judge, Hulme J, found an intention to kill and premeditation.  He also found that the offender was not remorseful.  He was 37 years of age and had a lengthy criminal record.  The sentence imposed was 22 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 17 years.  The calculation involved a discount of 10% for the plea.  However, as counsel for the Director noted, despite his criminal record, the offender had no prior sentence of imprisonment and certainly no record for violence of the kind to which the applicant was subject.
28A second murder case involving a former de facto partner, stabbed in her own home, was Regina v Robinson [2007] NSWSC 460.  The offender was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years.  He had no prior convictions but was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence.  Hall J found that the offender went to the home of the deceased intending to commit violence upon her and, when he attacked, intended to kill her.  He received a 20% discount for an early plea and a finding of limited remorse.  He was 32 years of age at the date of the offence and 34 years at the date of sentence: at [3].
29The third matter involved the killing of the partner of his former wife: Regina v Gabor Ziha [2008] NSWSC 145.  Again the offence occurred in the home, that of the ex-wife who was herself stabbed in the course of the attack.  The offender had no prior criminal record and suffered from depression.  He was 57 years old at the time of sentence by Barr J, who imposed imprisonment for 24 years with a non-parole period of 18 years.
30The final comparable case was Regina v Cotterill [2012] NSWSC 89.  The murder occurred when the offender broke into the house of a 19 year old woman, intending to steal.  The sentencing judge found that the killing was intentional, but not planned or pre-meditated.  Nevertheless, it was a vicious attack.  The offender was 18 years and 9 months of age at the time of the offence.  McCallum J sentenced him to 22 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years.  The sentence included a discount for the plea ""in the order of 15%"": at [19].  
Conclusion31While it is true that each of four cases involved a sentence of lower severity than that imposed on the applicant, none involved an offender with the applicant's record for violent assault, nor an attack of quite the ferocity of that undertaken by the applicant.  They do not demonstrate that the sentence imposed by Price J was manifestly excessive.  Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
32ADAMS J:  I agree with Basten JA.
33LATHAM J:  I agree with Basten JA.

		06 November 2013",2013-11-04 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal
2705918,RajLaw NSW Pty Ltd v RajLaw Pty Ltd [2013] NSWSC 1621,"Judgment

1By Contract of Sale dated 6 July 2012 the plaintiff company purchased from the first defendant that part of its legal business as was carried on in New South Wales. The second defendant (Mr Raj) was the sole director of the first defendant. The purchase price was $1 million subject to variations. A sum of $600,000 was paid on completion as part of the ultimate purchase price. 

2The plaintiff company is a legal practice. Mr Bechara Shamieh is its sole director. Mr Raj was previously a director but in some way that appointment, according to the ASIC search in evidence, ceased on 12 September 2013. The shares in the plaintiff company are held by Consolidated Corporate Pty Limited. Consolidated Lawyers Pty Limited is another legal company. Mr Shamieh is one of four directors. He holds a majority of the shares. The other directors are Graham Fullick, Therese Armstrong and Ramy Qutami. Veritas Legal Pty Limited is a third New South Wales legal company. The directors of this are Mr Qutami, Ms Armstrong and Mr Shamieh. Maddison Marcus Law Firm Pty Limited is the fourth law firm involved on the plaintiff's side. It has the same directors as Veritas.

3The Contract omits to describe the business name of the business sold but lists the type of business sold as ""legal firm"". There are special conditions to the contract relevant to this interlocutory hearing:

45.1 The Vendor and Purchaser agree to the following post settlement collaboration:

...

(c) Will use their best endeavours to assist one another to grow their respective practices.


45.2 The parties may agree to the following post settlement collaboration:

...

(b) Referral of work and clients to one another. For example, the Vendor shall refer to the Purchaser all work falling within the New South Wales jurisdiction and the Purchaser shall refer to the Vendor all work falling within the Queensland, [sic] even if a client is a national client, that is, the services they require fall within the Queensland jurisdiction and the New South Wales jurisdiction.

(c) Notwithstanding Clause 45.2(b) the Purchaser agrees that the Vendor may continue to act for National clients that he currently acts for from his Queensland office as disclosed in Annexure ""B"" of this agreement.

...

46 Restraint

(a) Mr Raj warrants that for a period of seven-(7) years he will not carry on or be engaged in the practice of law in New South Wales (unless otherwise required by the Purchaser) nor will he contact the clients and/or referral partners for the purposes of soliciting that client and/or referral partner to cease dealing with the Purchaser to return to the Vendor company and/or any other company to which Mr Raj is associated or otherwise connected.

(b) The Purchaser acknowledges that this Special Condition does not restrain Mr Raj from practising as a Solicitor in another state / jurisdiction other than in the State of New South Wales.

(c) The parties acknowledge that this Special Condition shall not merge on completion.

(d) In addition, the Vendor, its directors, shareholders and related entities agree that it will not open or be involved in a business, that is similar to or competitive with the Purchaser within the State of New South Wales for a period of seven-(7) years.

(e) The Vendor and its directors, shareholders and any related entity agree not to do any act or thing which would cause or is likely to cause the clients to seek the transfer of their file to another firm. For the purposes of this clause related entity has the same meaning as prescribed in the Corporations Act (2001).

(f) The Vendor and its directors, shareholders, employees (to the extent possible) and related entities covenant that they shall not undertake, engage or carry out any work on behalf of clients relating to the Practice of Law in New South Wales, a client domiciled in New South Wales and work that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales from any other state or jurisdiction, unless otherwise consented to by the Purchaser for a period of seven-(7) years from the Completion Date. This clause shall bear no effect on the Vendor with respect to clients domiciled in Queensland.

4There were discussions between Mr Raj and Mr Shamieh about an over- arching name for the Queensland and New South Wales businesses. The Queensland business after the sale continued to be operated by the first defendant. Mr Shamieh was in favour of Maddison Marcus. On the evidence as it stands Mr Raj did not agree to this. The Maddison Marcus website indicated that Consolidated Lawyers, Veritas Legal and Raj NSW Property Division were combined under the Maddison Marcus umbrella. Maddison Marcus has itself opened an office in Brisbane it seems consisting of Consolidated Lawyers and Veritas Legal but not Raj NSW. Members of the staff of Raj NSW have worked for Maddison Marcus clients from time to time but this does not really matter for the purpose of this interlocutory hearing.

5The third defendant, Arrow Law Pty Ltd (Arrow), was incorporated in July 2013. Mr Raj is one of two directors. A company, Astra Group Investments Pty Ltd, is a major shareholder. It is not clear whether Arrow has purchased the practice of the first defendant or whether there has been a transfer of business without purchase but Mr Raj is now practising as Arrow Law and is transferring the clients from the first defendant to the new firm.

6The substantive orders sought in the action are:

1. Declarations of breach by the first and second defendants of obligations under the restraint provisions of the contract for sale;

2. An order for specific performance of certain obligations the subject of the alleged breaches;

3. An order for final injunctions restraining breach of the restraint provisions and certain other provisions of the contract;

4. In addition, orders are sought restraining Arrow from carrying on any legal practice for 7 years, and an account of profits of the third defendant; and

5. Damages.

7This judgment deals with a claim for interlocutory relief. The principal orders sought are set out in prayers 20-25 and 27 of the Amended Summons as follows:

20. An order, until further order, restraining the Third defendant (whether by its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever) from carrying on, or being engaged in, legal practice.

21. An order, until further order, restraining the First and Second defendants (whether by its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever) from transferring the business of the first defendant to the third defendant.

22. An order, until further order, restraining the Second defendant (whether by its servants or agents or otherwise howsoever) from carrying on, or being engaged in, legal practice in a name other than 'Raj Lawyers' in Queensland and Victoria.

23. An order that the First defendant, Second defendant and Third defendant be restrained (whether by themselves, their servants or agents or otherwise howsoever), pending the final hearing of the proceedings, or further or earlier order, from:

a. carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled in New South Wales, or that involves the practice of law in New South Wales;

b. carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled outside of New South Wales that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales.

24. Further and in the alternative, an order, until further order, under section 232/234 of the Australian Consumer Law restraining the Third defendant from aiding and abetting the contravention by the First and Second defendant of section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law by carrying on, or being engaged in, legal practice.

25. Further and in the alternative an order, until further order, under section 232/234 of the Australian Consumer Law restraining the First defendant from contravening section of 18 of the Australian Consumer Law by:

a. restraining the First defendant from transferring its business to the Third Defendant;

b. restraining the First defendant from carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled in New South Wales, or that involves the practice of law in New South Wales;

c. restraining the First defendant from carrying on, or being engaged in, any work for a client domiciled outside of New South Wales that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales.

...

27. Further and in the alternative, an order, until further order, restraining the Third defendant from interfering with the Contract between the Plaintiff and the First defendant by carrying on, or being engaged in legal practice.


8There are additional claims under section 18 of Schedule 2 to the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Australian Consumer Law) against the first and second defendant. These are really representation claims based upon the contractual obligations and claimed breaches of those obligations.

9It is accepted by the defendants for the purpose of this hearing that there is a reasonable question to be determined as to whether Mr Raj is a party to the contract. It is I think clear that Arrow, through Mr Raj, had knowledge of the contract for the sale of business so that in accepting as clients those who were previously clients of Raj Law Pty Ltd there is at least a seriously arguable case to be tried as to whether Arrow induced a breach of the contract between the plaintiff and the first defendant: OBG Ltd v Allan [2008] AC 1 at 39-41 per Lord Hoffman. There is also a question of whether or not Arrow was formed as a sham for the purpose of enabling the first and second defendants to evade their obligations under the contract: Albert Locke (1940) Ltd v Winsford Urban District Council (1973) 71 LGR 308 (Chancery Division).

10Whether the tort of causing loss by unlawful means has been committed is not presently to the point. The decision of the House of Lords in OBG Ltd v Allan [2008] AC 1 shows why DC Thomson & Co Ltd v Deakin [1952] Ch 646 is no longer good law in England. There was a statement by Williams JA in Deepcliff Pty Ltd v Gold Coast City Council (2001) 118 LGERA 117 at 139 that it is only for the High Court of Australia to decide whether a tort of causing loss by unlawful means exists in Australia, after that Court refused to decide that question in Sanders v Snell (1998) 196 CLR 329. 

11Whether or not that tort is part of the law in Australia, the tort of inducing breach of contract is: Short v City Bank of Sydney (1912) 15 CLR 148. To that extent, the reasoning of the House of Lords is open to be followed here. Commentators have said that it could be followed: R P Balkin and J L R Davis, Law of Torts (2013, 5th edn) at 610. Judges have cited Lord Hoffman's speech relating to inducing breach of contract with apparent approval: Wilson HTM Investment Group Ltd v Pagliaro (2012) 226 IR 75 at 96 per Bergin CJ in Eq; Cleary v Kocatekin [2012] NSWSC 692 at [18] per Bergin CJ in Eq; LED Technologies Pty Ltd v Roadvision Pty Ltd (2012) 199 FCR 204 at 215-216 per Besanko J. 

12As the first and second defendants are restrained under the contract from carrying on legal business in NSW for 7 years and there is an arguable case that Arrow was formed for the purpose of circumventing this and that Arrow has induced the first defendant to breach its contract with the plaintiff, I consider there is a serious question to be tried on those issues. The balance of convenience is clearly in favour of an interlocutory order restraining Arrow from carrying on legal business in New South Wales. I can see no basis for restraining Arrow from practising anywhere at all as is actually sought.

Prayer 21 of the Amended Summons
13The evidence indicates that the transfer has taken place. In that case there would be no point in the order sought. In addition the argument on this claim as addressed by Mr AW Street SC was based upon clause 46(e) of the contract which in my opinion deals with clients of the NSW firm. There is no suggestion or threat such clients have been or will be approached to transfer or will be somehow transferred to Arrow. I do not consider there is a proper question to be tried on this claim.

Prayer 22 of the Amended Summons
14This claim appears to be contrary to rights under clause 46(b) of the contract. Clause 46(e) does not appear to vary clause 46(b) rights. There is no doubt that Mr Raj is involved in the Arrow company but the claim for interlocutory relief was not based upon the agreement as to collaboration under clause 45 of the contract.

Prayer 23 of the Amended Summons
15There is no evidence that any work of the nature referred to is being carried on or that there is some threat that it will be. Matters identified related only to completion of leasing matters where the costs had already been paid. In addition, the nature of the restraints sought in prayer 23(b) is expressed in terms that lack clarity and certainty. I do not consider the court would make the order sought. This is because one cannot ordinarily direct injunctions at people who are not parties and because ""any work ... that would reasonably be expected to be carried out in New South Wales"" is so uncertain and open to debate as to its meaning that it could not form part of a court order. 

Prayer 24 of the Amended Summons
16As I have said I intend to make an order pursuant to the claim in prayer 21 on a more limited basis I would not make a wider order under paragraph 24.

Prayer 25 of the Amended Summons
17In respect of prayer 25 the same conclusions are reached as I have already reached on the earlier paragraphs dealing with the contractual claims.

18Other interlocutory orders sought in the Amended Summons were not addressed by counsel and were therefore not pressed and I do not deal with them. I should add that clauses 46(a) and (c) of the contract of sale cannot impose obligations on Arrow which is not a party to the contract. 

Result
19The result of this is that an order will be made in more limited terms than that sought in prayer 20. The balance of the claims for interlocutory relief will be dismissed. As each party has had some success and as the final result has not been determined it seems to me that the appropriate order for costs is that the costs of the interlocutory hearing be determined by the trial Judge.

20It is, I think, important that this matter be determined on a substantive basis as quickly as possible. It seems likely that a lot of the evidence required for final hearing has already been gathered. I will make directions to do this.

Orders
1. Upon the plaintiff through its counsel giving the usual undertaking as to damages, order up until the final determination of the action or any prior order the third defendant be restrained from carrying on or being engaged in legal practice in New South Wales.

2. Costs of the Notice of Motion be determined by the trial Judge.

Directions
3. Direct the matter proceed on pleadings and the plaintiff file a Statement of Claim by 12 November 2013.

4. Direct the plaintiff to file a Notice of Motion by 7 November 2013 returnable on 15 November 2013 seeking an expedited hearing.

2705934,Abdul v R [2013] NSWCCA 247,"Judgment
1THE COURT:  The applicant was convicted after trial of one count of sexual intercourse without consent, contrary to s61I of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW).  The maximum penalty for this offence is imprisonment for 14 years.  Pursuant to s54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (CSP Act) the offence attracts a standard non-parole period of 7 years.
2On 1 May 2009 the applicant was sentenced by Neilson DCJ to imprisonment for 9 years and 4 months, with a non-parole period of 7 years, commencing 3 June 2008 and expiring 2 June 2015.
3The applicant seeks an extension of time within which to seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him.   The single ground of appeal relied upon by the applicant is:
Ground 1:  His Honour ""erred by treating the provision of the standard non-parole period as having determinative significance in sentencing"" the applicant.
Factual BackgroundThe offence4The complainant met the applicant about a week before the commission of the offence.  The victim had just turned 17 and the applicant was aged 21.  They were introduced by mutual friends at the BP service station at Warwick Farm.
5On that occasion the applicant asked the victim to go for a walk, which she interpreted as meaning to engage in some sexual activity.  The victim declined the invitation.  Later in the conversation, the applicant asked the victim to give him a ""head job"", which she also refused.
6On Tuesday, 9 October, 2007 approximately six days later, the victim had a fight with her father who told her to leave the house.  She telephoned her then boyfriend, Rami Lafta, who suggested that they go to a hotel or motel in the Liverpool area.  The victim agreed because she did not have anywhere else to stay.  She made her way by public transport to the Liverpool Railway Station where she was met by Rami Lafta and two other men, Nazir and Fadi.  The four travelled to the Grandstand Motel at Warwick Farm where the victim, Rami and Nazir stayed overnight.
7The victim woke the next day at approximately 11.30am.  At about 1pm Nazir's cousin arrived, stayed about an hour and when he left, Rami went with him leaving the victim alone in the room with Nazir.
8At about 4pm the applicant knocked on the door of the motel and was admitted into the room by Nazir.  The applicant said that he wished to talk to the victim.  The victim kept asking what he wished to talk about but he kept saying that he wished to talk to her.  Eventually the victim agreed to talk to him alone and Nazir left the room.
9When Nazir left, the applicant locked the door.  He tried to kiss the victim and kneeling on the bed undid his belt and trousers and exposed his penis.  He asked the victim to suck his penis, which she refused to do.  He repeated that request on a number of occasions and on each occasion the victim refused.
10A struggle then ensued with the applicant trying to remove clothing from the victim's lower half, pulling down her pants and underwear.  There was a further struggle over that.  At one stage the victim managed to get to her feet, but she was pushed back onto the bed by the applicant.  She was trying to get to the door to get out of the room when the applicant told her that she could not do anything.
11Eventually the applicant forced the victim's legs apart and, having pulled down her pants and underpants from her rear area, penetrated her from behind.  She said that when he inserted his penis into her vagina ""it really hurt"".  The victim continued to ask the applicant not to do it but he persisted with thrusting and after a few minutes, ejaculated into her vagina.  The applicant made no attempt to wear a condom and made no inquiry as to whether the victim was on any form of contraception.
12After he had ejaculated, the applicant withdrew from the victim's vagina and said ""See it wasn't that hard was it"".  The victim then went into the bathroom, locked the door, sat on the toilet and started to cry.  She was in there for a few minutes when the applicant knocked on the door and said ""Hurry up I need to go to the toilet"".  The victim washed her face and left the bathroom.
13When she left the bathroom, she found that Nazir was present.  Eventually she was taken by Nazir to the Liverpool Railway Station.  She caught a train to Campbelltown Railway Station and went to the Campbelltown Police Station where she made a complaint about what had occurred.
Background to this application
14After having been sentenced, the applicant filed a Notice of Intention to Appeal in relation to his sentence on 25 May 2009.  On 22 June 2009 the applicant made an application for legal aid in respect of the appeal.
15The applicant consulted with a solicitor who said that he would get an opinion from a barrister as to whether the applicant had a good chance of winning his appeal.  In June 2010 the solicitor advised him that the barrister did not think that he had good prospects of success on his appeal and that Legal Aid NSW would probably not support his appeal.
16In due course Legal Aid NSW refused the applicant's application for assistance.  The applicant appealed from that refusal.  On 25 October 2010 Legal Aid NSW (presumably the Legal Aid Review Committee), rejected the appeal and confirmed that it would not provide legal aid for his appeal as it did not consider that he had reasonable prospects of success ""in accordance with the Legal Aid merit test"".
17On 30 March 2011 Legal Aid NSW processed a further application for legal aid from the applicant dated 16 February 2009, and on 9 August 2011 Legal Aid NSW again confirmed the refusal to provide legal aid for the appeal because ""the application was not considered to have reasonable prospects of success in accordance with the Legal Aid merit test"".
18Between 4 March and 6 March 2013 the applicant's closed Legal Aid file was reviewed to determine whether the sentence might be susceptible to a review before the courts, due to ""Muldrock type errors"".  This was a reference to the decision in Muldrock v The Queen [2011] HCA 39; 244 CLR 120.   On 27 March 2013 a letter was sent to the applicant advising that his case had been reviewed and inviting him to make an application for legal aid so that further work could be conducted.  In due course this application was prepared and filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal Registry on behalf of the applicant on 28 June 2013.
19In order to understand what is meant by the expression ""Muldrock error"" it is necessary to say something about the background to that decision.
20In 2003 standard non-parole periods were introduced as part of the sentencing law of NSW.  Part 4 Div 1A (entitled ""Standard Non-Parole Periods"") was inserted into the CSP Act by the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Amendment (Standard Minimum Sentencing) Act 2002.  The provision created standard non-parole periods for several offences in a table located at the end of s54D (""the Table"").  The Table only applied to offences committed on or after 1 February 2003.  In 2007 and 2008 other offences were added to the Table.  
21The standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table (s54A(1)).  It ""represents an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table"" (s54A(2)).  When imposing a sentence of imprisonment for a standard non-parole period offence, ""the court is required to impose the standard non-parole period unless it determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period"" (s54B(2)).  A court is obliged to make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period.  It must identify in those reasons each factor that it took into account (s54B(4)).
22The decision of R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 was the leading authority on the question of how the standard non-parole provisions in Pt 4 Div 1A should be applied.  An Application for Special Leave to appeal from the decision in R v Way was refused by the High Court in 2005.  Thereafter, R v Way was applied repeatedly by the courts in this State.
23R v Way held the following:
(1) Under s54B of the Act when sentencing for an offence identified in the Table, after trial a sentencing judge must ask and answer the following question:  ""Are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?""
(2) Where a sentencing judge decides that the standard non-parole period ought not to be imposed, after trial or where the offender had pleaded guilty, the sentencing discretion should be exercised in accordance with established sentencing practices
(3) Division 1A of Pt 4 operates to provide a guidepost or benchmark against which the case in hand could be compared.  It does not require a departure from the intuitive or instinctive synthesis approach to sentencing.  
(4) Where the standard non-parole period is varied, due to s54B(4), reasons for the variation must be recorded expressly in the Remarks on Sentence and each factor taken into account must be specifically identified.
24Seven years after R v Way, the High Court held in Muldrock that R v Way was wrongly decided.  The Full Bench of the High Court in a single judgment held:
""25 ...  It was an error [of the court in R v Way] to characterise s54B(2) as framed in mandatory terms.  The court is not required when sentencing for a Div 1A offence to commence by asking whether there are reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period nor to proceed to an assessment of whether the offences fell within the midrange of objective seriousness.""
25The court said at [26]:
""26 ... It is a mistake to give primary, let alone determinative, significance to so much of s54B(2) as appears before the word ""unless"".""
At [32] the Court said:
""32 ... The Court of Criminal Appeal erred by treating the provision of the standard non-parole period as having determinative significance in sentencing the appellant.""
26What is clear is that the Muldrock decision weakened the link between the standard non-parole period and the sentence imposed in a particular case and diminished the role accorded to the standard non-parole period.
27The following can be extracted from the High Court decision in Muldrock:
(1) The fixing of the non-parole period is only one part of the larger task of passing a sentence.  Fixing the appropriate non-parole period is not to be treated as if it were the necessary starting point or the only important end point in framing a sentence to which Div 1A applies.
(2) Section 54B(2), read with sections 54B(3) and 21A of the CSP Act requires an approach to sentencing for Div 1A offences that is consistent with the approach to sentencing described by McHugh J in Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357.  
(3) The Court said at [27]:
""Section 54B(2) and s54B(3) oblige the court to take into account the full range of factors in determining the appropriate sentence for the offence.  In so doing, the court is mindful of two legislative guideposts:  the maximum sentence and the standard non-parole period.  The latter requires that content be given to its specification as ""the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" [s54A(2)].  Meaningful content cannot be given to the concept by taking into account characteristics of the offender.  The objective seriousness of an offence is to be assessed without reference to matters personal to a particular offender or class of offender.  It is to be determined wholly by reference to the nature of the offending.""
(4) A court is not required to commence with an assessment of whether the offence falls in the middle range of objective seriousness (by reference to a hypothesised offence) and then to ask whether there are matters which warrant a longer or shorter non-parole period.
(5) Section 54B(4) requires the Court to make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period.  This does not require the Court ""to attribute particular mathematical values to matters regarded as significant to the formation of a sentence that differs from the standard non-parole period or the need to classify the objective seriousness of the offending"" (at [29]).
28It follows that what has been referred to as ""Muldrock error"" involves a sentence judgment which traverses those statements of principle by the High Court.
29It was common ground between the applicant and the Crown that when sentencing the applicant, the sentencing judge had given determinative effect to the standard non-parole period so that error of the kind identified in Muldrock had occurred.
30The Crown did not accept that, pursuant to s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), any lesser sentence to that imposed by his Honour was warranted in law.  
Delay
31Pursuant to s5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (the Act), any appeal against sentence by a person convicted on indictment can occur only with leave of the Court.  Section 10(1)(a) of the Act prescribes a time limit of 28 days after the sentence for the giving of the Notice of Intention to apply for leave to appeal.  Section 10(1)(b) provides:
"" (b)  The court may, at any time, extend the time within which the notice under paragraph (a) is required to be given to the court or, if the rules of court so permit, dispense with the requirement for such a notice.""
32Section 10(1)(c) requires the appeal to be made in accordance with the rules of court.  Rule 3A(1) Criminal Appeal Rules provides (relevantly) that a Notice of Intention to apply for leave to appeal has effect for 6 months from the day of filing the notice.  Rule 3A(2) enables the Court to extend the period for which a Notice of Intention to apply for leave to appeal has effect.  Rule 3B(1) provides that a Notice of an Application for Leave to Appeal may only be given:
""(a) If a ... Notice of Intention to apply for leave to appeal has been given with respect to the ... sentence - within the period during which that Notice of Intention has effect, or 
(b) If a ... Notice of Intention to apply for leave to appeal has not been given with respect to the ... sentence - within the period of three months after the ... sentence.""
33In the present case the sentence was imposed on 1 May 2009.  The Notice of Intention to Appeal, filed 25 May 2009, lapsed.  Accordingly, an extension of over 4 years is sought.
34The Crown opposed the granting of an extension of time.  It did so on a number of bases:  The grant of an extension of time would be futile in that a change in the law does not provide a proper basis for an appeal.  The grant of an extension offended the principle of finality.  No proper explanation had been given for the delay.  The grant of an extension would not have adequate regard to the position of the victim.  On the facts, the application for leave to appeal against sentence was without merit.
35The Crown relied upon the comprehensive summary of principle and case law in Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; 205 A Crim R 138 where Campbell JA (with whom Latham and Price JJ agreed) said:
""18 In Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199 Johnson J (with whom Allsop P and Kirby J agreed) considered principles relevant to extension of time under section 10(1)(b). 
""8 The Court has a discretion with respect to extension of time under s10(1)(b) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  In exercising that discretion, the Court has regard to the prospects of success on the application for leave to appeal itself: R v Young [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30] ff.  The Court will usually require some satisfactory explanation as to why an appeal was not brought within the time allowed, especially if the delay is considerable: R v Beattie [2000] NSWCCA 201 at [17].
...
13 The principle of finality of litigation is relevant on an application such as this.  Although it may be, as here, that the Crown cannot point to any actual prejudice because of the delay in bringing the application, there is a public interest in avoidance of delay, and the finality of litigation, in the area of sentencing as with litigation generally.  In many cases, the prospect of sentence being reopened long after the event may impact adversely upon victims of crime.""
19 In R v Unger [1977] 2 NSWLR 990 Street CJ (with whom Begg and Ash JJ agreed) considered an application for an extension of time in which to appeal against conviction, in circumstances where a regulation had been held invalid after the conviction.  That regulation formed part of the primary judge's legal reasoning to the conclusion that the matters with which the Applicant had been charged were a contravention of the law.  While that fact situation is far removed from the present, the principles in accordance with which Street CJ declined to grant the extension bear upon any application for extension of time to appeal.  His Honour noted, at 993, the decision in R v Ramsden (1972) Cr L Rev 547 that:
""... alarming consequences would flow from any general policy of permitting the re-opening of cases by granting a substantial extension of time on the ground that a decision of a court of authority had removed a widely held misconception as to the prior state of the law.""
20 At 995 his Honour observed that there was a consideration of general principle that, when applied to extensions of time to appeal, had the effect that those alarming consequences did not arise:
""The trial having been concluded and the time for appeal having gone by, the general principle is that the matter is regarded as at an end.  It is to be borne in mind that the effect of a conviction in a criminal court no less than a verdict and judgment in a civil court, is to merge in that conviction or judgment, as the case may be, all of the material upon which it proceeded.  Dixon J as the Chief Justice then was, said in Victorian Stevedoring and General Contracting Co Pty Ltd v Dignan (1931) 46 CLR 73:
""... if he has already been convicted, then because his liability has merged in the conviction, it no longer depends upon the law under which it arose, and it does not lapse with the revocation of the law. The conviction has become the source of his liability for his offence, and the conviction continues in force because its operation does not depend upon the law creating the offence, but upon the authority belonging to a judgment or sentence of a competent Court.""
This concept of merger is no blind, arbitrary proposition. It is founded deeply in the fabric of the philosophy of the common law.  Although in pure theory the overruling or modification by judicial decision of previous conceptions of legal principle does no more than correct a departure from the timeless perfection of the law, the plain fact is that legal principle is constantly evolving and being moulded in the light of the changing and developing social context. Recognizing this, there has always been an unwillingness to permit the re-opening of past decisions.  Indeed the process of appeal, either civil or criminal, is a comparatively recent and statutory concept - it finds no basis in the common law itself.""
21 In R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199 Hodgson JA (with whom Levine and Simpson JJ agreed) observed at [38]:
""I accept that an important consideration as to whether an extension of time for an appeal should be granted is the consideration of what justice requires in all the circumstances.  However, plainly that question is not itself answered simply by the consideration that, if such a point were now taken at a trial and an appeal was now brought within time, the appeal would be allowed and a new trial ordered.""
22 After considering the statements of Street CJ in Unger, Hodgson JA continued, at [41]:
""... an important factor in a decision as to whether an extension of time should be granted is whether the interests of justice require it; but the interests of justice must take into account not just the interests of the applicant, but also those of the Crown (and the community represented by the Crown), and of the administration of law generally.  There are many factors relevant to those matters, including the powerful considerations supporting the finality of judicial decisions.""
23 There will sometimes be considerations concerning the interests of justice that arise concerning an application to extend the time for appeal against a conviction that do not apply to an application for leave to appeal against sentence.  In particular, if there was a prospect that a successful appeal against conviction would result in a retrial rather than an acquittal, practical difficulties about the availability of witnesses, the freshness of recollection of those witnesses who were available, and the appropriateness of putting witnesses through the ordeal of giving evidence once more would need to be taken into account.  Those considerations are not present in an application to extend time to appeal against sentence, at least when it is not suggested that any significant new facts bearing upon the appropriate sentence have arisen between the time the sentence was imposed and the time the matter comes before the appellate court.
24 Even so, the ""powerful considerations supporting the finality of judicial decisions"", to which Hodgson JA referred, apply to applications to extend the time for appeal against sentence.  As well, when a time limit has been laid down through legislation, it would be subverting the intention of the legislation for this court to consider the matter as though it were an application for leave to appeal against sentence brought within time, and if such an application would succeed, regard that as a sufficient reason for extending the time.  I recognise that ""exceptional circumstances"" are not, in so many words, expressly made part of the statutory scheme for granting an extension of time to appeal (Arja v R [2010] NSWCCA 190 at [4] - [5], cf McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174 at [5] - [7]).  Even so, it seems to me that the need to give weight to the factors I have just mentioned in operating the statutory scheme must call for something beyond the presence of factors that would be sufficient to result in a sentence being varied if an application for leave to appeal against sentence were brought within time.
25 Consistently with the principles involved in the cases I have just been citing, it is appropriate, in deciding whether to grant leave to appeal out of time, to consider the grounds upon which the appeal is sought to be brought in a more summary fashion than would be done on an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time.  As well, in the present case that also needs to be done in the context of the particular reasons the Applicant gives to explain the delay.""
36In response the applicant submitted that in this case there were no ""alarming consequences"" as were referred to in R v Ramsden (1972) Cr L Rev 547.  He submitted that the decision of Muldrock only has significance for a particular class of offender.  The Standard Non Parole Period Review Team within Legal Aid NSW had identified only 38 cases where no appeal had been heard, where it was considered that there was a potential Muldrock error and where a lesser sentence was warranted in law.
37The applicant noted that Street CJ in Unger had modified the words of Lord Greene MR in Re Berkeley (1945) Ch 1.  The applicant submitted that there was an important qualification in the statement of principle by Lord Greene MR when his Lordship said at p3 - 4:
""I find no difficulty in reconciling the statement that the different decision is not necessarily a ground for enlarging the time with the statement that the court can enlarge the time if it is just in the circumstances to do so.  It seems to me that the principle to be extracted is that it is not sufficient for a party to come to the court and say that a subsequent decision of a superior court has determined that the principle of law on which his case was decided was wrong.  The court will say to him: ""that bald statement is not enough.  What are the facts?  What is the nature of the judgment?  Who are the parties affected?  What, if anything, has been done under it?  And so forth.  In other words, the whole of the circumstances must be looked at.  If the court, in the light of those circumstances, considers it just to extend time, then it will do so.  That seems to me to be the proper principle ...""
38The applicant, while accepting that finality was an important consideration, submitted that it was necessary for the ""whole of the circumstances"" to be considered, including the reason for the delay, the length of the delay and the strength of the grounds of appeal (Young v R [1999] NSWCCA 275 at [30]; Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455;159 A Crim R 154 at [53]; Edwards v R [2009] NSWCCA 199; Ng v R [2011]  NSWCCA 227; 214 A Crim R 191 at [5]; Ward v R [2013] NSWCCA 46 at [8]).  The applicant accepted that the interests of justice included the interests of the Crown (representing the community) as well as the interests of the applicant.
39The applicant did not accept that it was necessary for him to establish ""exceptional circumstances"" before leave should be granted to extend time to appeal where there had been considerable delay.  The applicant submitted that there was no justification in Lawrence v R (1980) 1 NSWLR 122 (Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J) for importing a requirement for ""exceptional circumstances"" to be satisfied in such circumstances.  The applicant noted that in Young v R, Smart AJ (with whom Studdert and Dunford JJ agreed) said in relation to an earlier provision which was in identical terms, that it conferred ""an unfettered discretion upon the court to extend the time to appeal ..."".  Smart AJ in that case observed that in Lawrence, Nagle CJ at CL and Yeldham J before refusing leave to extend time indicated that they were satisfied that no injustice had been caused to the applicant and that no miscarriage of justice had occurred.
40The applicant noted that although Lawrence was cited with approval in McCall v R [2010] NSWCCA 174, more recently in Arja v R [2010] NSWCCA 190 Basten JA said:
""4 The power of the Court to extend time is discretionary, but is unfettered.  The statement in Lawrence should be understood as operating where ""any considerable delay has occurred"" and should be understood as a warning to those who delay not to expect any automatic grant of an indulgence.  In McCall, the Chief Judge noted that leave would not be granted in the absence of any satisfactory explanation for the delay and where no merit had been demonstrated in the proposed grounds: at [7].
5 Those are undoubtedly two critical factors in this case, as in most cases.  Reference to ""exceptional circumstances"" will usually be undesirable, as it suggests the imposition of a fetter on the exercise of discretion which is not to be found in the statutory scheme.
6 As Latham J has explained, the explanation advanced in the present case is not satisfactory, nor has the merit of the proposed appeal been demonstrated.  In these circumstances the appropriate course is to refuse the application for an extension of time.""
The applicant accepted that in Arja Latham J (with whom Hall J agreed) did not express an opinion on whether the test of ""exceptional circumstances"" needed to be satisfied before an extension of time could be granted.
41In summary, the applicant submitted that the matters raised by the Crown did not constitute a barrier to this Court granting an extension of time and intervening where the justice of the case warranted that course.  He submitted that when determining whether an extension of time ought to be granted, this Court should take into account all relevant factors including the merits of the proposed grounds of appeal.
Consideration
42There have been recent statements of principle in relation to the importance of the concept of finality.  In Montero v R [2013] NSWCCA 214 Leeming JA made the following observation.  He did so in the context of an application for extension of time within which to apply for leave to appeal against sentence where the error complained of was non-compliance with Muldrock.  His Honour said:
""2 There is a further reason for refusing the application for an extension of time. It is well established that a change in the law, even a change whose effect is that a conviction would be quashed on appeal, is not of itself sufficient to warrant the granting of an extension of time in which to appeal. This is an aspect of the principle of finality.
...""
43Having referred to R v Ramsden, R v Unger and State of NSW v Kable [2013] HCA 26; 87 ALJR 737 Leeming JA concluded:
""6 Those principles have been applied in this Court, including in R v Gregory [2002] NSWCCA 199 at [38] - [45] and Etchell v R [2010] NSWCCA 262; (2010) 205 A Crim R 138 at [19] - [24]. They were applied by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in R v Knight [1998] 1 NZLR 583 at 587-588 on which in turn the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal has consistently relied (the most recent decision is Chau Cheuk Yiu v Poon Kit Sang [2012] HKCFA 42; [2013] 1 HKC 478: see at [9] - [11] and [53] - [59]).  All four of those decisions recognise that ""exceptional"" circumstances must be shown to warrant departing from the principle of finality.
7 What will amount to the requisite exceptional circumstances cannot be defined exhaustively. However, in the present case, the application is more than three years out of time, and the majority of the sentence has been served. Most importantly, there is no explanation at all for the delay from 30 October 2009 until late 2011, save that the decision in Muldrock pointed to the possibility of an argument that the sentencing judge, who was bound by R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, had erred. That demonstrates the wholly adventitious background to the application which is now made. In my view this is a clear case for not departing from the principle stated in Unger.""
44Neither RA Hulme J nor Button J expressed a view on this point because the matter had not been fully argued and because it was unnecessary to do so for the resolution of the application.
45In Chau Cheuk Yiu v Poon Kit Sang [2012] HKCFA 42; [2013] 1 HKC 478 Justice Chan PJ (with whom Justice Ribeiro PJ, Justice Litton NPJ and Justice Gleeson NPJ agreed) said on the issue of finality:
""54 Where the sole or real ground of the proposed appeal is that there was a previous misunderstanding of the applicable law, the principle to be applied for determining whether to grant an extension of time was stated by this Court in Hung Chan Wa.  In that case, Chief Justice Li (with whom the other members of the Court agreed), having considered the relevant overseas jurisprudence, held that this ground by itself would not justify an extension but that there could be exceptional circumstances in a particular case which would justify an extension.   He added that the circumstances must be so exceptional that the occasions when they would be held to exist would be very rare.  
55 It is acknowledged that in the majority of cases, this principle may create a sense of grievance for the parties concerned.  However, the finality principle is considered as of such critical importance to the overall administration of the justice system that this factor outweighs other factors save in exceptional circumstances in which case extension should be granted.  Where such exceptional circumstances exist, one would expect that they would be plain and obvious and readily identifiable.""
46In the United Kingdom the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) has had occasion to recently consider the question of finality.  In Jawad v The Queen [2013] EWCA Crim 644 the Court (Lord Justice Hughes, Mr Justice Foskett and Judge David Radford) said:
""29  We therefore do not have to decide the question mentioned and we have had only brief submissions upon it. We nevertheless think that we should make clear the general approach of this court, over many years, to change of law cases.  An extension of time will not be granted routinely in such a case simply because the law has changed. It will be granted only if substantial injustice would otherwise be done to the defendant, and the mere fact of change of law does not ordinarily create such injustice.  Nor is the case where an extension will be refused limited to one where, if the law had been correctly understood at the time of the proceedings in the Crown Court, a different charge or different procedure might well have left the defendant in a similar position to that in which he now finds himself.  The line of authority setting out this court's approach culminates in R v Cottrell & Fletcher [2007] EWCA Crim 2016; [2008] 1 Cr App R 7, where the judgment was given by Sir Igor Judge P, as he then was.  But that line of authority includes similar pronouncements by successive Lords Chief Justice from Lord Lane CJ onwards.  An early example is R v Mitchell (1977) 65 Cr App R 185 in which Lane LJ (as he then was) expressly approved the decision of this court in R v Ramsden [1972] Crim LR 547.  There, a defendant who had been convicted of dangerous driving before Gosney (1971) 55 Cr App R 502 had held that fault was a necessary ingredient of the offence was refused leave to appeal out of time after the latter decision had been published.  The Court observed that alarming consequences would flow from permitting the general re-opening of old cases on the ground that a decision of a court of authority had removed a widely held misconception as to the prior state of the law on which the conviction which it was sought to appeal had been based. No doubt otherwise everyone convicted of dangerous driving over a period of several years could have advanced the same application. A similar proposition was recently adumbrated by the Supreme Court of Ireland in A v Governor of Arbour Hill Prison [2006] IEFC 45 where the court held that absolute retroactivity would lead to 'dysfunctional effects in the administration of justice. ...""
47Similar observations were made by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in R v Bestel and Others [2013] EWCA Crim 1305 (Lord Justice Pitchford, Mr Justice Mitting and Mr Justice Openshaw).  The Court reviewed previous decisions involving ""change of law and the principle of finality"".  The Court cited with approval the quotation from Lord Bingham CJ in  Hawkins [1997] 1 Cr App Rep 234 at 239 where his Honour said:
""Counsel goes on to submit that a change in the law since the date of conviction or plea of guilty has not usually been regarded in the past as good reason for granting an extension of time in which to appeal.  In support of that submission he has drawn our attention to Lesser (1940) 27 Crim App R 69, Ramsden (1972) Crim L R 547, Re: Berkley (1945) Ch 1 and Mitchell (1977) 65 Crim App R 185. ...
That practice may on its face seem harsh.  On the other hand, the consequences of any other rule are equally unattractive.  It would mean that a defendant who had roundly and on advice accepted that he had acted dishonestly and fraudulently and pleaded guilty, or who had been found guilty and chosen not to appeal, could after the event seek to re-open the conviction.  If such convictions were to be readily re-opened it would be difficult to know where to draw the line or how far to go back.
Counsel on behalf of the applicant suggests there is a readily available line of demarcation which would distinguish those serving sentences from those who had completed their sentences.  That, however, would not in our judgment be an altogether satisfactory line of demarcation in the case of those who were serving sentences for other offences as well as for the offences against in this case section 15(1).
It is plain, as we read the authorities, that there is no inflexible rule on this subject, but the general practice is plainly one which sets its face against the re-opening of convictions recorded in such circumstances.  Counsel submits, and in our judgment submits correctly - that the practice of the court has in the past, in this and comparable situations, been to eschew undue technicality and ask whether any substantial injustice has been done.  In suggesting that this is and has been the practice reference has been made to McHugh (1977) 64 Crim App R 92, R v Ayres (1984) 78 Crim App R 232, (1984) AC 447, Pickford (1995) 1 Crim App R 420 and Molyneux and Farmborough (1981) 72 Crim App R 111.""
48The Court also cited with approval the following from R [2006] EWCA Crim 1974, [2007] 1 Cr App Rep 150:
""30 It is the very well established practice of this  Court, in a case where the conviction was entirely proper under the law as it stood at the time of trial, to grant leave to appeal against conviction out of time only where substantial injustice would otherwise be done to the defendant.  R v Lesser (1939) 27 Crim App R 69 is an early example of emphasis that absent special reasons an application out of time will not be allowed ...""
49Having reviewed those and a number of other decisions, the conclusion of the Court was succinctly stated as follows:
""31 The principle of finality that decisions made under the law as it was then understood should not be disturbed unless substantial injustice would follow is well recognised and we must apply it.  ...""
50It seems to us that the following principles can be extracted from the cases to which the parties have referred the Court.  The principle of finality is an important one and it applies to the criminal law as much as to civil cases.  Moreover, its application in the criminal law is not restricted to conviction appeals but applies also to sentence appeals.  As was said by Hodgson JA in Gregory, there are ""powerful considerations supporting the finality of judicial decisions"".  
51As the cases make clear, time limits are specified by the legislature for a reason and ought not be lightly set aside.  The interests of justice must take into account not only the interests of the applicant, but also those of the community represented by the Crown and of the administration of law generally.  The prospect of a sentence being re-opened long after the event may impact adversely upon victims of crime, particularly as here where the crime involves the sexual violation of the victim.
52There is, however, some force in the applicant's submission that there is no justification for imposing a test of ""exceptional circumstances"" before the principle of finality can be displaced.  The analysis in Young and Arja concerning the unfettered discretion of this Court when dealing with applications for extensions of time is persuasive.  A better test against which to assess such applications is that set out by Campbell JA in Etchell  where his Honour said:
""24 ... Even so, it seems to me that the need to give weight to the factors I have just mentioned in operating the statutory scheme must call for something beyond the presence of factors that would be sufficient to result in a sentence being varied if an application for leave to appeal against sentence were brought within time.""
By that approach, the Court is required in exercising its discretion whether to extend time, to have regard to the prospects of success on the application for leave to appeal itself.
53The English Courts in what they have described as ""change of law"" cases, have enforced the principle of finality except where ""substantial injustice"" would follow.  While what occurred in Muldrock v The Queen is not strictly speaking a change of law, it is analogous to the ""change of law cases"" considered by the English Courts.  Accordingly, when considering an application for extension of time based on ""Muldrock error"", all relevant factors need to be considered - the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the interests of the community, the interests of the victim and whether, if an extension of time were refused, substantial injustice would result.  This last factor will inevitably require an assessment of the strength of the proposed appeal although as Etchell made clear, that assessment can be carried out in a ""more summary fashion"" than would be done in an application for leave to appeal that was brought within time.

54By reference to those factors, this application is not particularly strong.  The length of the delay is substantial - over 4 years.  To allow an extension of time would offend the principle of finality and may well involve added trauma for the victim.  Moreover, the explanation for delay is not compelling.  Having considered the circumstances relating to the applicant's sentence, Legal Aid NSW on at least two occasions rejected the applicant's application as having insufficient prospects of success.   The only change which has occurred was the handing down of the decision in Muldrock.
55In relation to the last factor, however, it is still necessary to assess the prospects of success of the application for leave to appeal.
56When considering the merits of the application for leave to appeal against sentence, the Court has to apply the sentencing principles set out in Muldrock.  The Court does this in the context of applying s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).  That section relevantly provides:
""6(3) On an appeal under section 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of the opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal.""
57The final issue before the Court therefore is whether if ""Muldrock error"" has been conceded in the approach of the sentencing judge, and if that error is considered material, any lesser sentence is warranted in law.  In making that assessment, in accordance with Baxter v R [2007] NSWCCA 237; 173 A Crim R 284 the Court is to re-exercise the sentencing discretion afresh, taking into account all relevant statutory requirements and sentencing principles.  That is not to say that the findings of the sentencing judge are to be ignored but the applicant does not have to establish that the sentence was manifestly excessive before this Court can consider whether a lesser sentence is warranted.
58In re-exercising the sentencing discretion, this Court has regard to the circumstances at the time of the application.  This means that the Court may have regard to evidence of post-sentence events (Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; 159 A Crim R 154 at [124]).
59As already indicated, the re-exercise of the sentencing discretion to determine whether ""substantial injustice"" would follow if an extension of time were not granted is determinative in this matter.  None of the other factors identified in the decided cases favour the granting of such an extension.  In particular the explanation for delay is somewhat problematic, being based purely upon a change in the previously understood sentencing principles applicable in NSW.
60The applicant accepted that the objective criminality of the offence was serious.  Although it was asserted that the victim had not suffered injuries, this could only be a reference to physical injury.  The Victim Impact Statement made over 18 months after the commission of the offence made it clear that she was continuing to experience significant psychological sequelae.  Even without the statement, given the age of the victim and the circumstances of the offending, such long term effects could be inferred as likely to occur.  
61The applicant did not demonstrate any remorse or contrition nor did he have any insight into his offending behaviour.  On the contrary, during the trial and in his pre-sentence report, the applicant accused the victim of fabricating her complaint which he said was financially and racially motivated.
62There were serious aggravating features under s21A(2) of the Act.  The applicant was on two forms of conditional liberty (a good behaviour bond and a suspended sentence) for offences of violence at the time of this offence.  The two year good behaviour bond was imposed for an offence of common assault and he was subject to a 12 month suspended sentence for a malicious wounding offence.  It was only 6 months after the bond and suspended sentence were imposed that the applicant committed this offence.
63The sentencing judge's unchallenged finding was that there were no mitigating factors under s21A(3) of the Act to be found in favour of the applicant.  
64The applicant's submissions to the effect that a lesser sentence was warranted were based on his age at the time of the offence (21), sentencing statistics and four sentences which were said to be comparable.
65While it is true that the applicant was aged 21 at the time of the offending, he was significantly older and more experienced in life than the victim and his poor criminal record disentitled him to any particular leniency in that regard.
66As the High Court made clear in Hili v The Queen; Jones v The Queen [2010] HCA 45; 242 CLR 520 at [54]:
""54 ...  history of sentencing can establish a range of sentences that have in fact been imposed. That history does not establish that the range is the correct range, or that the upper or lower limits to the range are the correct upper and lower limits."" 
67With offences of this kind, the benefit of statistics is even more constrained.  This is because of the enormous variation in the factual background to the offending.  Such variations can often have a decisive role in a Court determining an appropriate sentencing range.  
68The process of comparing one sentence with another is in any event somewhat problematic.  In Vandeventer v R [2013] NSWCCA 33 Adamson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Rothman J agreed) said at [45] - [46]:
""45 One cannot adjudge whether a sentence falls within an appropriate range by reasoning from particular instances. Applicants will always be able to find cases where offenders appear to have been dealt with more leniently. So, too, will the Crown be able to find cases where offenders have apparently been dealt with more severely than the applicant for leave to appeal on sentence. This is not, however, the way in which this Court determines whether a sentence is manifestly excessive.

46 The sentencing consistency to which the law aspires is, as the High Court said in Hili, at [18]:
""... consistency in the application of relevant legal principles, not some numerical or mathematical equivalence.""""
69The four cases to which the Court was referred were Graham v R [2008] NSWCCA 174, Dionnet v R [2009] NSWCCA 85, Ali v R [2010] NSWCCA 35 and Philopos v R [2008] NSWCCA 66.  The submission was that although the sentences imposed in those matters were similar, albeit slightly higher than that imposed on the applicant, each case involved more serious offending than had occurred in this case.  It followed, so the applicant submitted, that this indicated that the penalty imposed on him was too severe.
70The problem for the applicant with that submission is that there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" sentence for a particular offence.  The most that can be said is that there is a range of sentences for an offence which the Court regards as appropriate.  Accordingly, it is unhelpful to focus on a small number of cases as has been done here and to highlight by reference to those cases differences and similarities from which to argue that the particular sentence imposed was not warranted.
71Apart from the approach being problematic, there were significant factual differences between those cases and that of the applicant.  In two of the cases, the sentences imposed were ameliorated because the offenders suffered from mental illness.  In none of the four cases was there the aggravating feature that the offence was committed while on conditional liberty.  All of the offenders in the four cases had more compelling subjective cases than did the applicant.
72There is nothing in this examination of the matters raised on behalf of the applicant which would allow, let alone compel, a conclusion that any lesser sentence is warranted in law.  Certainly nothing approaching ""substantial injustice"" has been established.  It follows that to allow the application for leave to appeal against sentence to proceed would not have sufficient prospects of success to justify the considerable extension of time that the applicant seeks.  
73For the reasons given, even if an extension of time were granted, and if leave to appeal against sentence were granted, we are not satisfied that pursuant to s6(3) of the Act a lesser sentence than that which was imposed is warranted in law.
74The application for extension of time is dismissed.
