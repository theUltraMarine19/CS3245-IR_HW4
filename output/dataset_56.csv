GROUNDS OF JUDGMENT
The plaintiffs are a firm of registered architects and civil and structural engineers. The defendants are a family company of property owners. The claim is for architectural and engineering services rendered by the plaintiffs to the defendants in respect of the development of a shopping cum office complex on Lots 9-15 and 9-23 T.S XXVII known as the `Heeren Centre' (the project). The plaintiffs were appointed by the defendants as the project's architects and engineers sometime in November 1981. Their services were terminated by the defendants on 5 June 1989. As at the date of termination the plaintiffs had obtained written permission for the construction of a 22-storey building and the building plans were virtually complete. The dispute centred on the quantum (not the entitlement) of the payment to the plaintiffs as at the date of the termination of their services. At the end of the trial I gave judgment for the plaintiffs for one-half of 10% of the estimated cost of the building which I fixed at $50m, less all sums of money paid to the plaintiffs to account of their fees and costs to be taxed. I awarded the plaintiffs interest on the sums due to them at 6% per annum from the date of the writ.
The defendants have appealed against this judgment. I now give my reasons.
The defendants own a vast amount of landed property in Singapore. The founder of the defendants was a wealthy Malaysian by the name of Chee Swee Cheng. His grandson, Chee Bay Hoon, inherited the defendants. Alfred Chung Meng Ang (Alfred Chung), the second plaintiff, is the principal architect in the plaintiffs. Sometime in 1967 Alfred Chung had occasion to meet Chee Bay Hoon in connection with the signing of building plans he had prepared for a client, for the extension of a building on land in Orchard Road which was owned by the defendants. This chance meeting led to Alfred Chung and Chee Bay Hoon coming on friendly terms, a relationship, which Alfred Chung avowed when giving evidence, he cultivated. This relationship led to Chee Bay Hoon and the defendants engaging the plaintiffs as their architects and engineers. It is in evidence that Alfred Chung himself became somewhat of a confidante to Chee Bay Hoon on whose advice Chee Bay Hoon decided to develop the defendants' properties in the Orchard Road area as a hedge against compulsory acquisition by the government.
In 1968 the plaintiffs had been engaged as the defendants' architects and engineers in connection with the development of a property in Devonshire Road and another in Bideford Road. A third development for which the plaintiffs' services were engaged by the defendants was in 1973 of a property in River Valley Road. Alfred Chung said in his evidence that for these three developments there had been no formal agreement as to the basis of the plaintiffs' professional charges but that he had explained to Chee Bay Hoon, who personally over-saw these developments for the defendants, that the plaintiffs' charges would be based on the Singapore Institute of Architects' (SIA) scale of charges. Accordingly, the plaintiffs had charged a fee of 10% of the total construction costs and the defendants had accepted these charges and had paid. He pointed out that there was no dispute whatsoever over the plaintiffs' charges. In fact Alfred Chung pointed out in his evidence that before the River Valley Road development was awarded to the plaintiffs, Chee Bay Hoon had offered the plaintiffs a retainer of $3,000 per month if the plaintiffs would reduce the percentage from 10% to 7+% but he, Alfred Chung, on behalf of the plaintiffs had refused to accept the retainer and insisted on the plaintiffs' fees being 10% of the total construction costs. Chee Bay Hoon on behalf of the defendants had accepted and had gone on to award the plaintiffs the River Valley Road development. In corroboration of all this Alfred Chung referred in evidence to the correspondence and the plaintiffs' bills relating to these three developments to substantiate his contention that by a course of dealing there was to be implied an agreement that the plaintiffs' professional charges would be based on the SIA scale of charges, that is to say 7+% for the architectural services and 2+% for the engineering services, making a total of 10% of the total construction costs.
The project itself was first conceived in 1977 but had to be shelved as part of the land on which the development was to take place had been leased out. Steps had to be taken to terminate the lease and repossess the land. This was achieved only in November 1981 and it was then that the defendants had commissioned the plaintiffs to apply for planning approval of a 27-storey building. Planning approval, subject to certain conditions was ultimately obtained in January 1983 for a 22- storey building.
In the meanwhile in 1982 the plaintiffs were commissioned by the defendants to carry out another development at Upper East Coast Road. This development of 42 units of townhouses and flats was completed in 1984 and as previously the plaintiffs based their professional charges at 10% of the total construction costs. The correspondence and bills relating to this development were referred to in evidence by Alfred Chung. They clearly show that the basis of the plaintiffs' professional charges to be 10% (i.e 7+% for architectural and 2+% for engineering) of the total construction costs. These charges were duly paid by the defendants.
I have referred to the background of the dealing between the plaintiffs and the defendants to show what the course of dealing or the course of conduct was between them, in so far as the plaintiffs' professional charges were concerned, in respect of the developments for which they were engaged by the defendants. As between Alfred Chung who represented the plaintiffs and Chee Bay Hoon who represented the defendants in these developments there was in my judgment no question but that the professional charges of the plaintiffs would be 10% of the total construction costs and that the SIA conditions would apply. It was Alfred Chung's evidence that it was to be implied that the plaintiffs' professional charges for the project was also 10% of the total construction costs. However the defendants disputed this at the trial. The defendants did not dispute that whatever the arrangements were, the arrangements were in fact entered into by Alfred Chung for the plaintiffs and Chee Bay Hoon for the defendants. The defendants did not call Chee Bay Hoon to controvert the evidence of Alfred Chung and as there was no formal agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants regarding the plaintiffs' professional charges for the project the conclusion is inevitable that it was to be implied that the arrangement would be as it was in the case of all the other developments of the defendants, i.e 10% of the total construction costs.
In so far as it is necessary for me to make a finding I find that when the plaintiffs were engaged as the defendants' architects and engineers for the project in November 1981 it was on the implied agreement that the plaintiffs' charges for their services would be charged at 10% of the total construction costs of the project.
As I have said the defendants failed to call Chee Bay Hoon as a witness. I was told that Chee Bay Hoon was ill and was thus unable to attend court to give evidence. I do not doubt that Chee Bay Hoon was ill. The fact however remains that only Chee Bay Hoon could have controverted the evidence of Alfred Chung. If Chee Bay Hoon was unable to attend court when the trial commenced in April 1993 steps could have been taken to record his evidence de bene esse or when fortuitously the trial was part heard the further hearing dates could have been taken to suit the convenience of Chee Bay Hoon. The defendants did not do this but relied solely on the evidence of their only witness, James Chee. I have no choice but to conclude that had Chee Bay Hoon been called as a witness his evidence would not have supported the defendants' contention at the trial that there was no understanding between him representing the defendants and Alfred Chung representing the plaintiffs that the plaintiffs' charges, as the defendants' architects and engineers, for the project was based on the SIA conditions and was to be charged at 10% of the construction costs of the project.
James Chee is the son of Chee Bay Hoon. He came to Singapore from Malaysia in 1974 to look after the defendants' properties in Singapore. He was involved in the defendants' development of their properties in Singapore but only as a supervisor of the construction works. On his own admission in evidence he was never involved in discussing the development concepts, the costs of the developments and other financial details which were exclusively done by Chee Bay Hoon himself. He frankly admitted that he had no knowledge of the fee arrangements, if any, that were made by Chee Bay Hoon on behalf of the defendants with Alfred Chung on behalf of the plaintiffs for any of the developments undertaken by the defendants including the project.
I must confess that I failed to understand during the trial and I am also unable to understand even now, reading the transcript of his evidence again, the relevance of his evidence of obtaining from Alfred Chung a copy of the SIA conditions and scale of charges and whether it was the 1979 edition or was it some earlier edition. I also failed to understand the importance defendants' counsel attached to this as both Peter Von Selkey (PW-2) and Raymond Kuah Leong Heng (DW-2) were agreed that the SIA conditions were in existence from as early as 1972, if not before, and was extensively relied on by practising architects in basing their charges for their professional services.
It was evident, however, that what the defendants were endeavouring to do was to show that in so far as the charges for the plaintiffs' professional services were concerned for the project there was no agreement, express or implied, so as to rely on the Architect's Rules 1982. Since I have found that there was to be implied from the course of dealing between the plaintiffs and the defendants that there was an agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the plaintiffs' charges for their professional services would be based on the SIA conditions and be charged at 10% of the total construction costs, the Architect's Rules 1982 has no relevance whatsoever for the purposes of computing the fee to be paid to the plaintiffs for their professional services for the project from November 1981 to termination on 5 June 1989.
I now turn to consider the estimated cost of construction of the project. It is agreed by both parties that up to the time of termination there was no agreement on the construction costs of the project. The only evidence of what was contemplated, of which there is no dispute, came from Alfred Chung who testified that his brief was, `to build a building taller than Yen San Building and to fully utilise the plot ratio'.
It was not until James Chee had made a verbal request, at the instigation of Tan Kok Soon, the manager of the defendants who was also an executor of the late Chee Swee Cheng, in 1984 that an estimate was given by the plaintiffs. In the course of applying for planning permission it was necessary for the plaintiffs to furnish to the planning department certain statistical information among which is to give the estimated cost of construction of the proposed development. In this connection the plaintiffs had estimated the cost of construction of the project at $40m. This was in February 1982. So when James Chee had made his verbal request the plaintiffs wrote to him on 2 May 1984 as follows:-
`We refer to your verbal request.
We would suggest that for your budgeting purposes the following building cost estimates be taken:-
(i) ...
(ii) Proposed office/shopping complex at Orchard Road/Cairnhill Road (the project) - S$40 million.
Please note that our estimate given above for your ""Heeren Centre"" does not include for your compensation to existing rent-controlled tenants nor legal and ancillary fees required.
Furthermore, the estimate for this particular project is based approximately on current rates; whereas you will no doubt appreciate that for reasons beyond your control we feel that the building works may not be put in hand until mid-1985 or later.'
When the plaintiffs' services were terminated the plaintiffs based their charges on an estimated cost of construction of $50m. At the trial the plaintiffs called expert witnesses who estimated the construction costs of the project at between $60m and $63m. The defendants however wished to tie the plaintiffs to $40m. They did not call any expert witnesses of their own to dispute the evidence of the plaintiffs' expert witnesses. It was obvious that due to the escalation of building costs there would have to be an upward revision of the estimated construction costs of the project.
There was nothing in the evidence to indicate that there was an agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendants that the construction costs of the project would be kept within the budgetary figure of $40m given by the plaintiffs to the defendants by the plaintiffs' letter of 2 May 1984. I formed the view that Alfred Chung was competent to estimate a realistic construction costs for the project at the date of the termination and notwithstanding the experts' evidence I held that a reasonable estimate for the construction costs of the project as at the date of termination was $50m.
The stage of work reached at the date of termination was hotly contested. Having already ruled that the Architect's Rules 1982 have no relevance for the purpose of determining the appropriate fee to be paid to the plaintiffs I shall determine this question by reference to the SIA conditions. For convenience I refer to the 1979 version of the SIA conditions. The relevant clauses are cll 3(ii), (iii), (iv) and (viii) which I set out below:-
Clause 3(ii)
For taking clients' instructions, preparing sketch designs sufficient to indicate the architect's interpretation of the clients' instructions, and preparing preliminary drawings and particulars sufficient to enable applications to be made for planning approval, and for ""in principle"" approval in connection with any specific by-law, the fee shall be one-third of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost of such works.
Clause 3(iii)
For taking clients' instructions, preparing sketch drawings, making approximate estimates of cost by cubic measurement or otherwise and preparing sufficient drawings for the purpose of submitting to the appropriate authority to obtain building approval, the fee shall be one-half of the approximate percentage due on the estimated cost of such works.
Clause 3(iv)
For taking clients' instructions, preparing sketch designs, making approximate estimates of cost by cubic measurement or otherwise and preparing working drawings, specification, or such other particulars as may be necessary for the preparation of bills of quantities by an independent quantity surveyor, or for the purpose of obtaining tenders, the fee shall be two- thirds of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost of such works.
Clause 3(viii)
In cases where the architect performs partial services for any reason including the abandonment, deferment, substitution or part thereof, or if the services of the architect are terminated the fees in respect of the services put forward shall be as set down for the various stages of work as set out above.
Should the work performed fall between the stages of work set out above, then the fee chargeable shall be the percentage chargeable for the stages at the higher level.'
Written permission or `in principle approval' for the project was obtained on January 1983. Accordingly, and without dispute, the stage provided in cl 3(ii) had been fully accomplished. Furthermore the plans for obtaining building approval were at an advanced level of preparation, requiring only the preparation of elevation and section drawings. I have not lost sight of the fact that there were two sets of plans for obtaining building approval in existence, one with round columns and the other with rectangular columns. Despite this, the evidence of Von Selkey (PW-2) and Raymond Kuah (DW-2) although each gave different estimations of the work accomplished were not at variance in that the plaintiffs had qualified for their charges to be based under cl 3(iii) i.e `one-half of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost'. The question was whether the plaintiffs would qualify for charging their fees under cl 3(iv) i.e `two-thirds of the appropriate percentage due on the estimated cost.' Von Selkey thought so since although building approval had not yet been obtained certain building works in the nature of sheet piling had already been commenced. However in my opinion, and as I understood the evidence, the sheet piling was done to maintain the integrity of the land due to construction works on the adjoining site. In my view since the building plans had not yet been submitted for approval the plaintiffs were not quite ready to call for tenders. Hence the plaintiffs had not entered into the works specified in cl 3(iv). They were in my judgment well into the works specified in cl 3(iii) and by reason of the proviso to cl 3(viii) entitled to charge under cl 3(iii), that is to say, one-half of the agreed percentage due of the estimate cost of construction of the project.
The engineering works too were at an advanced stage at the date of termination. Both Von Selkey and Raymond Kuah agreed that the plans for roads, drains and culverts had been prepared and that they were essential for obtaining building approval. Furthermore Chung Meng Lim, the engineer in the plaintiffs, gave evidence that he was ready with the final calculations and produced them in court (Ex. P2). These calculations were for the rectangular columns. He referred to his discussion with James Chee in 1987, who was now taking more interest in the development concepts of the project, over the shape of the columns and his preparedness to round off the edges of rectangular columns to make them more circular as desired by James Chee. He also referred to an instance two months before the termination when James Chee had requested to `delete one column as the column space is money to him'. Chung Meng Lim decided to accommodate James Chee and had started working on the scheme when the plaintiffs' services were terminated.
The defendants' pleaded case was that the plans for building approval were never prepared. By insinuation the defendants were suggesting that what was produced in court as plans prepared for building approval were prepared to support the plaintiffs' claim. The defendants were never able to make good this plea. James Chee in his evidence admitted that he had seen the two sets of plans for building approval in the plaintiffs' office, his position at trial being that he did not understand the nature and impact of these plans. He feigned ignorance as to what was required for obtaining building approval after `in principle' approval had been obtained. For one who has been connected with the defendants' developments since 1974 I find this incredible. In the last resort the defendants tried to contend that the plaintiffs had proceeded to prepare plans for building approval without the authority of the defendants. I find this also incredible in view of the letters in the agreed bundles whereby the plaintiffs repeatedly informed the defendants of the progress they were making in the preparation of the plans for obtaining building approval. There are also the discussions I have referred to between Chung Meng Lim and James Chee on the configuration of the columns which can only be by reference to the plans for building approval.
The conclusion I reached was that the plaintiffs were entitled to one-half of the agreed 10% of the estimated construction costs of the project which I fixed at $50m and I gave judgment for the plaintiffs accordingly less all sums previously paid to account of the plaintiffs' fees. I also awarded the plaintiffs the costs of the action and interest at the rate of 6% per annum on the sum due to the plaintiffs from the date of the writ.",1993-11-19 00:00:00,SG High Court
