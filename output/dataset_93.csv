This was an appeal against the decision of the assistant registrar in which he (i) dismissed with costs an application by the Straits Times Press (1975) Ltd (`STP`) for an order to set aside the third party notice issued by the defendant against STP pursuant to an order made on 7 August 1988, or alternatively, for an order to discharge the order of 7 August, and (ii) made an order for third party directions in terms of an application by the defendant. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, I dismissed it with costs. I now give my reasons.
On 6 May 1988, one Francis Seow (`FS`) was detained under the Internal Security Act (Cap 143). While under detention he made a statutory declaration on 16 May 1988 which contained, among other things, the following statements: `I look up people like Devan Nair whose opinion and views I felt I could benefit from ... . Sometimes about mid-1987, I called on Devan at his house ... `.
On 20 May 1988 or thereabout the political desk of STP received from the government of Singapore a statement in respect of FS`s detention and excerpts from his statutory declaration. As the involvement of the defendant in the statutory declaration was a newsworthy story, one Leslie Fong, then head of the political desk of STP, directed Bertha Henson, a reporter, to seek an interview with the defendant. Bertha Henson got in touch with the defendant and as a result an interview was arranged which took place at the defendant`s home in the evening of 20 May 1988. Before the interview began, Bertha Henson handed to the defendant copies of the government`s statement and excerpts from FS`s statutory declaration to read. After the defendant had read the documents, Bertha Henson conducted the interview in which the defendant said, among other things, the following: 
 
I recall telling him [Francis Seow] that in doing so, he did nothing exceptional. He was in the distinguished company of Mr Lee Kuan Yew and the rest of us, ...
 
 
 
I recall that Mr Lee himself visited establishment and opposition circles in capitals like London, Sydney and Wellington to court goodwill and support for the PAP`s goal of Malaysian Malaysia, ...
On the following day, 21 May 1988, the government`s statement, the excerpts from FS`s statutory declaration and statements made by the defendant at the interview were published in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
. The defendant`s statements were headed with the title `Devan confirmed he gave political advice to Seow`.
The plaintiff responded to the defendant`s comments through his press secretary, James Fu, in a written statement dated 21 May 1988 which was received by STP from the Ministry of Communication and Information. On the following day, an article containing this statement or a substantial portion thereof was published in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 and was entitled in bold print `Devan dishonest in saying Seow did nothing wrong`. The article contained, among other things, the following: 
 
Mr James Fu, press secretary to the Prime Minister, said Mr Nair was dishonest in making those statements.
 
 
 
He said Mr Nair knew that what Seow had done was wrong, especially his contacting US state department officials to seek support and asylum.
In the afternoon of the same day, Leslie Fong`s office received a telephone call from the defendant requesting for someone to collect a statement by the defendant at the latter`s house. Accordingly, Bertha Henson went there and collected the statement. The statement was headed `Response of Devan Nair to the statement of James Fu ( 
 The Sunday Times 
, 22 May 1988)` (`press statement`) and contained, among other things, the following: 
 
Other versions of the history of Singapore`s brief experience as part of Malaysia tell a different story. One of them is that of Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia`s first prime minister, who told me not long ago, that he had all the facts at his disposal to warrant the arrest of Mr Lee when he was the most vociferous member of the Malaysian opposition. ...
 
 
 
... But in courting and sedulously cultivating a whole variety of foreign establishment and opposition circles, we did no more than what Mr Seow is supposed to have done in his meetings with US state department officials, who turned out to be rather small fry. Mr Lee courted far more powerful figures in the countries concerned.
A substantial portion of the press statement was published by STP in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1988 bearing a large heading `Devan rejects criticism that he was dishonest`. The article contained, among other things, the following: 
 
He reiterated his defence of Seow, first made when he spoke to 
 The Straits Times
 on Friday night, saying that `in courting and sedulously cultivating a whole variety of foreign establishment and opposition circles, we (PAP leaders) did no more than what Seow is supposed to have done in his meetings with state department officials ... `.
 
 
 
These officials `turned out to be rather small fry`, he added. `Mr Lee courted far more powerful figures in the countries concerned.`...
Mr Nair added that the Tunku told him not long ago that he (Tunku) `had all the facts at his disposal to warrant the arrest of Mr Lee when he was the most vociferous member of the Malaysian opposition.`
On 25 May 1988, the plaintiff instituted this action against the defendant claiming damages for two alleged libels published by the defendant and an injunction restraining the publication of the alleged libels. The first alleged libel consisted of the words spoken by the defendant on 22 May 1988 which were broadcast and published on the radio by the British Broadcasting Corporation. The words complained of were: 
 
He [meaning Mr Francis Seow] did not do anything which Lee Kuan Yew and I had done with greater distinction when we were sitting on the opposition benches of the Malaysian Parliament.
 
 
 
The second alleged libel was that passage from the defendant`s press statement which I have earlier set out. After the action had been commenced, pleadings were delivered followed by various interlocutory proceedings.
On 7 April 1989, the plaintiff obtained leave of the court to amend the statement of claim by adding a claim for a third alleged libel which was the passage from the article published by STP on 23 May 1988 in 
 The Straits Times 
 entitled `Devan rejects criticism that he was dishonest`, which I have earlier set out. The plaintiff complained that that passage of the article was libellous of him. Subsequently, amended defence was delivered by the defendant and amended reply was delivered by the plaintiff.
It is in respect of this publication by STP on 23 May 1988 that the defendant seeks an indemnity or contribution from STP. On 7 August 1991, the defendant applied ex parte for leave to issue a third party notice claiming an indemnity or contribution from STP to the extent that the court finds just and equitable under s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed) on the ground that the third alleged libel was published by STP on 23 May 1988 to a wide audience in Singapore. An order was made on the same day, that is, 7 August 1991, for the issue of a third party notice, and thereafter the third party notice was issued and was served on STP.
On 17 October 1991, the defendant took out a summons for third party directions, No 6843 of 1991, which was returnable on 18 November 1991. Prior to the return date, STP took out an application by Summons-in-Chambers No 6848 of 1991, for an order that the third party notice issued pursuant to the order dated 7 August 1991 be set aside or that the order of 7 August authorizing the issue of the third party notice be discharged. That summons was returnable on 6 January 1992. Both the summonses were subsequently fixed for hearing on another date and were heard together before the assistant registrar. At the conclusion of the hearing, the learned assistant registrar dismissed the application by STP and made an order for third party directions in terms of the application by the defendant. Against the decision of the learned assistant registrar on both the summonses STP appealed.
The learned assistant registrar has given detailed reasons for his decision, which may be summarized as follows. First, he treated the third party procedure as analogous to a cause instituted by a defendant as the plaintiff against the third party as the defendant with the consequence that the third party may defend himself in any way in which a defendant in an action at the suit of the plaintiff may defend himself. Accordingly, he held that the application by STP to set aside the third party notice at the interlocutory stage was governed by the same principles applicable in an application by a defendant to strike out a statement of claim of the plaintiff under O 18 r 19 or the inherent jurisdiction of the court. Next, the learned assistant registrar went on to consider whether the defendant had a prima facie case against STP for an indemnity or contribution. In that connection, he considered the contention of STP that as the defendant had authorized the handing of the press statement to STP, the defendant had consented to the publication and that such consent was a defence to the defendant`s claim for an indemnity or contribution. He accepted that in an action for libel consent of the plaintiff to the publication by the defendant of the defamatory material is a defence to the plaintiff`s claim, but he held that the authorities did not go that far as contended on behalf of STP. He was of the opinion that the claim for an indemnity or contribution was not a cause of action founded in tort but was a right sui generis conferred by statute. Though the consent to the publication could well be raised in a claim for an indemnity or contribution, it would not necessarily operate as a complete defence such that STP bore no responsibility whatsoever for any damage and that the claim of the defendant would obviously be unsustainable. The question of apportionment of responsibility between the defendant and STP would necessarily be examined at the trial in the light of all the relevant circumstances. He therefore came to the conclusion that the defendant had established a prima facie case against STP for an indemnity or contribution, and such claim ought to proceed to trial. I agree substantially with the reasoning of the learned assistant registrar, and, but for the fact that counsel for the defendant and STP have argued at great length before me, I would not be disposed to go further.
I turn first to the procedural point raised by both parties. Mr Elias for STP submitted that STP as the third party is entitled to avail itself of any defence available to a defendant in an action by the plaintiff, and third party procedure is analogous to a cause instituted by the defendant as the plaintiff against the third party as the defendant with the consequence that the third party may defend himself in any way in which any defendant in an action at the suit of a plaintiff may defend himself: see 
 Barclays Bank v Tom 
 1 where it was held that a person who had been served with a third party notice was entitled to counterclaim against the defendant. I accepted this submission, and in considering the application by STP I applied the same principles governing the determination of an application by a defendant to strike out the plaintiff`s claim under O 18 r 19 or inherent jurisdiction of the court. In 
 Ronex Properties Ltd v John Laing Construction Ltd & Ors 
 ,2 there was an application by the third party for an order striking out the third party notice on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action as the defendants` right to recover contribution was time-barred. The application was dismissed by the judge and on appeal the Court of Appeal dismissed it. The court held that since the statutes of limitation merely barred the remedy and not the cause of action and since a defence of limitation when pleaded might be subject to exceptions, the application to strike out a claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action was misconceived. The court went on to say that in a very clear case of time-barred defence with evidence in support the defendant could apply to strike out the claim as frivolous, vexatious and abuse of process of the court.
Mr Loh for the defendant submitted that upon the summons for third party directions the third party proceedings ought not to be set aside or third party directions be refused, unless the third party (or the plaintiff) could show `special circumstances` why directions should not be given. He cited the following passage from 1 
 Supreme Court Practice 1991 
 para 16/4/7: 
 
If a prima facie case under r 1(1)(a) is made out, or if the case is clearly such as is contemplated by (b) or (c) it will be for the plaintiff or third party to show some special circumstances why the direction should not be given.
 
 
 
Order 16 r 1(a), (b) and (c) of the Rules of the Supreme Court in England referred to in the above passage are in pari materia with corresponding O 16 r 1(a), (b) and (c) of our Rules of the Supreme Court. Mr Loh relied on 
 Courtenay-Evans & Anor 
 
 v 
 
Stuart Passey & Associates (a firm) & Anor
 
[1986] 1 All ER 932
 where the court adopted that statement as correct. In that case, there was considerable delay in taking out third party proceedings and the court considered the delay and the consequences that would arise if the third party proceedings were permitted to proceed as `special circumstances` and dismissed the application for third party directions. However, Mr Elias was not contending that there was any special circumstance but that the defendant had not made out any prima facie case against the third party. Hence, the question of `special circumstances` is irrelevant. I agree.
Mr Elias sought to show that the defendant`s claim against STP for an indemnity or contribution was obviously unsustainable. He referred to 
 Cookson v Harewood 
 4 and 
 Chapman v Lord Ellesmere & Ors 
 5 where it was held that consent previously given by the plaintiff to the publication of defamatory material of him was a defence to a claim for damages for defamation. Mr Elias argued by analogy that the same defence was available to STP in resisting the claim by the defendant for an indemnity or contribution. The publication by STP of the defendant`s press statement in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1988 was made at the request or with the consent of the defendant, and the publication contained substantially the same content as the press statement. Accordingly, the defendant had no claim against the third party for an indemnity or contribution.
I think it cannot be disputed that when the defendant requested STP to collect the defendant`s press statement, he intended to request STP to publish it in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1988 or as soon as possible thereafter. The publication of the content of the press statement therefore was made with his consent. Such consent may well be relevant in the defendant`s claim against STP for an indemnity or contribution. But at this stage I am not disposed to hold that the consent is a complete answer to the claim of the defendant. The cases of 
 Cookson v Harewood 
 4 and 
 Chapman v Lord Ellesmere 
 5 certainly did not go that far.
The defendant`s claim for an indemnity or contribution is founded on s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed), which, in so far as material, is as follows: 
 
 
(1) Where damage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime or not) - 
 
... 
 
(c) any tortfeasor liable in respect of that damage may recover contribution from any other tortfeasor who is, or would if sued have been, liable in respect of the same damage, whether as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise, so however, that no person shall be entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought. 
 
(2) In any proceedings for contribution under this section the amount of the contribution recoverable from any person shall be such as may be found by the court to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of that person`s responsibility for the damage; and the court shall have power to exempt any person from liability to make contribution, or to direct that the contribution to be recovered from any person shall amount to a complete indemnity.
  
 
 
The publication by STP on 23 May 1988 was a republication of the defendant`s press statement. If the press statement is held to be a libel, then the publication by STP is equally a libel. `Every republication of a libel is a new libel, and each publisher is answerable for his act to the same extent as if the calumny originated with him`: see 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) p 117. In those circumstances, both the defendant and STP are tortfeasors, and STP clearly `is, or would, if sued, have been, liable in respect of the same damage` as provided in s 11(1)(c); the question of the defendant`s claim for contribution will then arise and the court will under s 11(2) have to determine such amount of contribution as may be found to be just and equitable having regard to the extent of STP`s responsibility.
The next submission of Mr Elias that the defendant has no case against STP for an indemnity or contribution is founded on the later part of s 11(1)(c) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed), namely: `no person is entitled to recover contribution under this section from any person entitled to be indemnified by him in respect of the liability in respect of which the contribution is sought`. In his submission, STP is entitled to an indemnity from the defendant on two grounds. First, STP published the defendant`s press statement on 23 May 1988 as the agent of the defendant. In support, he relied on 
 R v Cooper 
 ,6 which was a case of criminal defamation. There, the defendant was indicted for publishing, causing and procuring to be published in a newspaper called the 
 Liverpool Chronicle 
 a libel on one Rev Joshua King. At the trial it was proved that the defendant communicated a story of King and his brother to the editor of the newspaper and asked the latter to publish it in the newspaper so as to `shew up` King. The story was published in an article in the newspaper; thereafter the defendant told the editor that he had seen it and that he liked it very much. On those facts, the defendant was found guilty of the charge. Lord Denman CJ said at p 536: 
 
If a man request another generally to write a libel, he must be answerable for any libel written in pursuance of his request: he contributes to a misdemeanor and is therefore responsible as a principal. He takes his chance of what is to be published. Here the defendant first desires the newspaper editor to `shew up` the prosecutor, and communicates to him the particulars of the story which afterwards appears in the newspaper. Having given this general authority, he meets the editor and says that the article has not appeared. That which did in fact form the foundation of the libel, and which the editor communicated to the reporter, was what the defendant communicated to the editor: and, after the publication, it was approved of by the defendant. It is observed that there were additions: but the editor said that what the defendant communicated was substantially what was published. ... I have no doubt that a man who employs another generally to write a libel must take his chance of what appears, though something may be added which he did not state. Here I have not the slightest doubt. There is, first, an employment; secondly, an identity of subject matter; thirdly, a complaint of the delay in the publication; fourthly, an approval; fifthly, evidence that the libel is substantially that which was communicated.
 
 
 
Mr Eilas relied on this passage of the judgment Lord Denman CJ to found his argument that when STP published the defendant`s press statement, the defendant was responsible for that publication as the principal and STP was merely his agent.
Mr Elias relied also on 
 Parkes v Prescott & Anor 
 .7 In that case, at a meeting of a board of guardians there were discussions of the conduct of the plaintiff and defamatory statements of the plaintiff were made. Reporters were also present at the meeting. The defendant E during the meeting expressed the hope that the press would take notice of the `very scandalous case` and requested the defendant P, who was the chairman, to give an outline of the case, which P did. P then also expressed the hope that the press would take notice of it and that publicity would be given to the matter. After the meeting, a correct summary of the proceedings containing matters defamatory of the plaintiff was published in two local newspapers. The plaintiff sued both the defendants for libel. The judge at the trial directed the jury to find for the defendants, holding that there was no evidence of publication. On appeal, his decision was reversed and a new trial was ordered. Montague Smith J, in the course of his judgment, said at pp 177-178: 
 
... loose expressions of a mere wish or hope that proceedings should be published would not be sufficient to fix liability on the defendants in cases like the present. I think the words must be of such a kind, and used in such a manner, as to satisfy the jury that they amounted to, and were in fact, a request to publish. If the words do amount to such a request, and the publication be made in pursuance of it by the persons to whom it was addressed, then it seems to me the persons making such request would be responsible for the libellous matter so published. ...
 
 
 
It is, of course, plain that if a man gives a copy of his speech to another to publish, he is answerable as a publisher. It cannot be contended that he would not be equally answerable if he desired a reporter to take down his speech as he delivered it, and to publish it. ...
... The man who requests another to make and publish an outline or summary of a speech, writing, or proceedings, must know that the words will be to some extent those of him who makes such summary or outline; and he must, therefore, be taken to constitute him an agent for the purpose, and be answerable for the result, subject always to the question whether the authority has been really followed.
He then referred to 
R v Cooper
 
[1846] 8 QB 533
[] 115 ER 976
 and in conclusion said, at p 179: 
 
In the result I come to the conclusion, that on principle it is correct to hold that where a man makes a request to another to publish defamatory matter, of which, for the purpose, he gives him a statement, whether in full or in outline, and the agent publishes that matter, adhering to the sense and substance of it, although the language be to some extent his own, the man making the request is liable to an action as the publisher. If the law were otherwise, it would in many cases throw a shield over those who are the real authors of libels, and who seek to defame others under what would then be the safe shelter of intermediate agents. I make this observation only with reference to the general consequences which would result from the arguments relied on to sustain the defendants` contention.
 
 
 
All that the two cases decided was that where a person has authorized or requested another person to publish any material defamatory of a third party the person who has so authorized or requested it would, for the purpose of such publication and vis-a-vis the third party, be liable for the libel as the principal and the publisher was his agent. Those cases, however, did not decide that as between the person who has authorized or requested the publication and the other person who has published it pursuant to such request, the latter was the agent of the former. In the case before me, as between the plaintiff and the defendant, the latter can be held to be responsible as the principal for the publication of the article in the issue of 
 The Straits Times 
 on 23 May 1992 and, if the words complained of by the plaintiff are held to be defamatory, the defendant would be liable as the person who has authorized the publication. However, as between the defendant and STP there was no relationship of principal and agent. Indeed, there was no contractual relationship at all between them in respect of the publication made by STP on 23 May.
Next, Mr Elias submitted that assuming that when STP published the content of the press statement on 23 May, STP was not the agent of the defendant, STP would nevertheless be entitled to be indemnified by the defendant as it published it at the request of the defendant. He founded his submission on the following broad principle of law: where an act is done by one party at the request of another which act is not manifestly tortious to the knowledge of the person doing it and such act turns out to be injurious to the rights of a third party, the person doing the act is entitled to an indemnity from the other person who requested for the act to be done: 
 Dugdale & Ors v Lovering 
 8 and 
 Lord Mayor & c of Sheffield v Barclay & Ors 
 .9 In 
 Dugdale v Lovering 
 8 the plaintiffs were in possession of certain trucks claimed by the defendant and a third party. The plaintiffs asked the defendant for an indemnity against delivery of the trucks to him. In a subsequent letter the defendant did not reply to the question of indemnity but requested for delivery of the trucks to which the plaintiffs acceded. The third party then claimed against the plaintiffs for conversion; the claim was proved to be well founded and the plaintiffs paid a sum in settlement. They then looked to the defendant for an indemnity. It was held that the defendant was liable to indemnify the plaintiffs. In his judgment, Brett J quoted the following passage of the judgment of Tindal CJ in 
 Toplis v Grane 
 :10 
 
We think this evidence brings the case before us within the principle laid down in 
 Betts v Gibbins
 2 Ad & E 57, that when an act has been done by the plaintiff under the express directions of the defendant which occasions an injury to the rights of third persons, yet if such an act is not apparently illegal in itself, but is done honestly and bona fide in compliance with the defendant`s directions, he shall be bound to indemnify the plaintiff against the consequences thereof. and held that on the facts there arose an implied promise by the defendant to indemnify the plaintiff.
 
 
 
In 
 Lord Mayor & c of Sheffield v Barclay & Ors 
 ,9 the defendant bank forwarded to the corporation transfers of the corporation`s shares with a request for registration and in consequence the registration was effected. Subsequently, it was discovered that one of the transfers was forged and the corporation had to purchase shares and registered them in the name of the true owner. The corporation then sought an indemnity from the bank. The House of Lords held that the bank was liable to indemnify the corporation. The Earl of Halsbury LC in his speech said, at p 397: 
 
In 
 Dugdale v Lovering
 LR 10 CP 196 Mr Cave, arguing for the plaintiff, put the position thus: `It is a general principle of law when an act is done by one person at the request of another which act is not in itself manifestly tortious to the knowledge of the person doing it, and such act turns out to be injurious to the rights of a third party, the person doing it is entitled to an indemnity from him who requested that it should be done.` This though only the argument of counsel was adopted and acted upon by the court, and I believe it accurately expresses the law. ...
 
 
 
... The principle insisted upon by Mr Cave in his argument quoted above has been undoubtedly sanctioned as part of the law by several old decisions, and I think the principle as enunciated is well established.
Lord Davey made a similar pronouncement when he dealt with the duty of the corporation to register the shares; he said at p 399: 
 
...I am further of opinion that where a person invested with a statutory or common law duty of a ministerial character is called upon to exercise that duty on the request, direction, or demand of another (it does not seem to me to matter which word you use), and without any default on his own part acts in a manner which is apparently legal but is, in fact, illegal and a breach of the duty, and thereby incurs liability to third parties, there is implied by law a contract by the person making the request to keep indemnified the person having the duty against any liability which may result from such exercise of the supposed duty. And it makes no difference that the person making the request is not aware of the invalidity in his title to make the request, or could not with reasonable diligence have discovered it.
 
 
 
The proposition of law quoted by Mr Elias is correct but, in my opinion, is not applicable here. Nor are the two cases of any assistance. The factual situation here is entirely different from those present in the two cases. In this case, there is no doubt that in requesting STP to collect his press statement on 22 May and authorizing the delivery thereof to Bertha Henson, the defendant intended what he wrote to be published by STP on the following day or soon thereafter. But the fact remained that whether the press statement should or would be published in 
 The Straits Times 
 and how, when and to what extent it was to be published were matters entirely for STP to decide. As Mr Loh for the defendant said, and I agree with him, STP published it not solely because of the `request` made by the defendant but because STP considered that it constituted a newsworthy story and that the matter was of continuing public interest. Leslie Fong in his affidavit affirmed on 4 November 1991 said: 
 
It was clear to me at the time that the defendant expected STP to accord him the right of reply to James Fu`s statement contained in 
 The Sunday Times
 when his press statement was handed to STP`s reporter. It was also apparent that the defendant authorized the publication of his press statement or excerpts of it by distributing the same to members of the press. As the matter was of continuing public interest, an article quoting substantially the whole of the defendant`s press statement was published in 
 The Straits Times
 on 23 May 1988.
 
 
 
STP was under no obligation to the defendant to publish it - certainly there was no legal obligation to do so. STP had not been requested to publish it in the way that it would have been, had it been a request for publication of an advertisement or letters to the press.
Another argument developed by Mr Elias that STP is entitled to an indemnity is this. The statement in respect of FS`s detention and the excerpts from FS`s statutory declaration issued by the government and the response of the plaintiff released by his press secretary were issued by the government of Singapore and therefore fell within the ambit of para 5 of Pt II of the schedule to the Defamation Act (Cap 75)(`the Act`). In publishing those statements, STP had a defence of qualified privilege under s 12(1) of the Act if sued by the defendant for libel, and in order to maintain such defence STP necessarily had to publish in 
 The Straits Times 
 `a reasonable letter or statement by way of explanation or contradiction` requested by the defendant. Therefore, when the defendant `requested` STP to publish his press statement, STP did so under s 12(2) of the Act in order to preserve the defence of qualified privilege. In such circumstances, so Mr Elias submitted, the republication by STP was not `illegal` or manifestly tortious, and at law there was an implied contract by the defendant to indemnify STP against any damage sustained by the latter because the republication was made at the defendant`s request.
I am unable to accept this submission. To deal with this point it is helpful to set out in full sub-ss (1) and (2) of s 12 of the Act, which are as follows: 
 
 
(1) Subject to this section, the publication in a newspaper of any such report or other matter as is mentioned in the Schedule shall be privileged unless the publication is proved to be made with malice. 
 
(2) In an action for libel in respect of the publication of any such report or matter as is mentioned in Part II of the Schedule, this section shall not be a defence if it is proved that the defendant has been requested by the plaintiff to publish in the newspaper in which the original publication was made a reasonable letter or statement by way of explanation or contradiction, and has refused or neglected to do so, or has done so in a manner not adequate or not reasonable having regard to all the circumstances.
  
 
 
These provisions, in my opinion, are of no assistance to Mr Elias`s argument. Assuming that the statement of FS`s detention and excerpts from his statutory declaration and the plaintiff`s response released through his press secretary are matters falling within para 5 of Pt II of the schedule and assuming also that the publication by STP of the defendant`s press statement was made pursuant to s 12(2), it was a publication which STP decided to make for its own protection, ie to preserve the qualified privilege in respect of the publication of the materials from the government. The publication also served the interest of STP in other respects: the press statement was obviously a newsworthy item for publication in a newspaper. The decision to publish it rested solely with STP. STP decided to publish it. In these circumstances, it is hardly tenable that an implied contract to indemnify STP arose from the `request` made by the defendant to publish his press statement.
At this stage, I am only concerned with whether there is a question proper to be tried as to the liability of STP for a contribution or indemnity claimed. In my opinion, in the present case, there is certainly a question proper to be tried as to the liability of STP to make contribution under s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed). In the old case of 
 Pontifex v Foord 
 11 the defendant, a lessee of certain premises, was sued by the lessor for breach of covenant to repair and he obtained leave to issue a third party notice claiming contribution or indemnity from a sub-lessee. At the hearing for third party directions Field J refused to give directions, and on appeal his decision was affirmed. Pollock B at p 156 said: 
 
... It seems to me that this is no case of contribution or indemnity, and therefore that the learned judge was right in refusing to give directions, and that this appeal must be dismissed. In coming to this conclusion, I do not think we are in any way overruling the decision of the divisional court which gave leave to serve the third party notice. It may be that there was a prima facie case made out for allowing the defendant to serve the notice, but when it comes to be a question of directions, we must then be satisfied that there is a question proper to be tried as to the liability of the third party to make the contribution or indemnity claimed.
 
 
 
Similarly, in 
 Baxter v France & Ors 
 12 at p 457 Lord Esher MR said: 
 
... On that summons for directions, the first thing to be considered under the rule, is whether the court or a judge is `satisfied that there is a question proper to be tried as to the liability of the third party to make the contribution or indemnity claimed, in whole or in part`. If satisfied of this, the court of a judge `may order the question of liability to be tried`. In this case there must be a summons for directions, and I have not the least doubt of the meaning of the rule being that if, in considering the application, the judge is of opinion that there cannot be any question of contribution or indemnity, he will direct that no such question is to be tried.
 
 
 
These pronouncements are equally applicable here, and I respectfully adopt them. There were two applications before the learned assistant registrar: the application by the defendant for third party directions and the application by STP for setting aside the third party notice or discharging the order for issue of the third party notice. He held that there was a question proper to be tried as to the liability of STP to make the contribution or indemnity claimed. I agree entirely with his conclusion.
